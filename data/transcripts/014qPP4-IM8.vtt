speaker that's the membership change and
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
as far and that was at the request of
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
the uh of of the Prime
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%

the um chair of the committee that more
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
than likely would be dealing with this
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
type of issue
 
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
um which is um
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
resources it would change the
 
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
membership uh to two members of the
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%

whomever the or wherever the speaker
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
chooses and that is
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
about the membership changes on
 
00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:18.550 align:start position:0%
about the membership changes on
this

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%

um the additional change to Senate Bill
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:23.560 align:start position:0%
closings and that is the summary as I
 
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
see it and I will entertain any
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
questions last part again the very last
 
00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:31.639 align:start position:0%
one um the last one is part five that is
 
00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:33.590 align:start position:0%
one um the last one is part five that is
being

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
removed and I would point out
 
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
um or remind the the membership the
 
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
committee that
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
removal does not um in my
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
estimation terminate the ability either
 
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
for ad hoc committees over the summer
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
Andor uh remove the ability for those
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
committees to be
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
reintroduced um as separate bills in the
 
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
next second half of the legislative
 
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
term representative
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
ran is this can everyone hear me now
 
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
with this button pushed here I see nods
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
how about that is that good uh in in
 
00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:26.839 align:start position:0%
addition to that not only could they be
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
reintroduced but if they standalone
 
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
bills they'll go to the correct
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
committee hopefully rather than all
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
lumped together in the Omnibus
 
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
legislation which has heard these issues
 
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
before in the past I'm certain and they
 
00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:40.839 align:start position:0%
would have a better understanding of the
 
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
issues than we do here in this committee
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
given the fact that very little
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
testimony came in on not only the
 
00:12:51.189 --> 00:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
purpose of this or supporting or opposed
 
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
or I I just think that it would be
 
00:12:55.949 --> 00:12:55.959 align:start position:0%
better dealt with in the Committees that
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
should be getting these bills thank you
 
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
representa rouard uh we're taking
 
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
discussion on the
 
00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.110 align:start position:0%
discussion on the
amendment

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
to take a break for lunch if any
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
additional amend ments want to be
 
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:31.800 align:start position:0%

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you for your question um
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
it is the intention of the chair um to
 
00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959 align:start position:0%
listen to amendments I I only know of
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
these two amendments at this present
 
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:49.720 align:start position:0%
time um if in the course of this
 
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
discussion um further amendments are
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate then I would be happy to
 
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
um to schedu Ule any type of change as
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
we go but right now I only have two
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
amendments in my possession and and
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
that's all I know of to to this point
 
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question um it it
 
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:17.720 align:start position:0%
does um my my
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
commentary so I don't I don't have any
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
issues um or anything with the the
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
change up of the the makeup of the the
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
Committees and all that that that all
 
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
looks fairly well reasoned um
 
00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
I am very unhappy though that this
 
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
amendment removes section one the
 
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
commission to study workplace safety and
 
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
healthare settings um that's really the
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
only section of this bill that had any
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
input from the public and it was
 
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.030 align:start position:0%
input from the public and it was
unanimously

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
unanimously
 
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.389 align:start position:0%
unanimously
supportive

00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
supportive
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
um I always get a little salty when we
 
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
take action in committee that goes
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
against like unanimous public support
 
00:14:59.790 --> 00:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
and this was the only part of the bill
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
that the public really provided input
 
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
for and they were all supportive um so
 
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:07.959 align:start position:0%
as drafted I cannot support this
 
00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
amendment I would be very
 
00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically supportive of an
 
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that was identical to this but
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
did not remove section one thank you Mr
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:26.749 --> 00:15:26.759 align:start position:0%
comments I think my button is still
 
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
pushed can you still hear me sorry sorry
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
about that um I guess the the question
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
that I had for the workplace safety and
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
healthc Care settings um I was very
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to some of the folks and had
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
welcomed additional emails coming with
 
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
additional information and I I did not
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
receive a whole lot I think I got one
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
email that sent a copy of a statute that
 
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
was um an assault statute and I didn't
 
00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
make a copy of it so if you folks also
 
00:15:59.710 --> 00:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
received it um you probably know what
 
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um I I have a little
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
bit of a different uh take on this and
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
and that is I would rather have health
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
and human services or some other
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
committee listen to this that may have
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
heard this before uh the statute that
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
was provided to us would not in any way
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
affect um workplace safety in my mind
 
00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
however uh I think the bigger issue is
 
00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:30.350 align:start position:0%
however uh I think the bigger issue is
the

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
self-control of the hospitals in in in
 
00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
putting in policies and procedures for
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
their health care workers to uh
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
encourage folks to report any assaults
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
that they have that seemed to be and I
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
do recall that coming in representative
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
Smith so uh I think that that can be
 
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
done not only with the quality but also
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
with the uh risk management uh in each
 
00:17:00.509 --> 00:17:00.519 align:start position:0%
of those settings and and rather than
 
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
the state legislating what happens in
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
both private and public hospitals it
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that they would want to
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
regulate that as an entity hospitals
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
across the state or even Across the
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
Nation as a matter of fact for policy
 
00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
setting I'm just not sure that a statute
 
00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:19.959 align:start position:0%
coming in would be something that that
 
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
is the right way to go but I would
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
almost defer to the committee that has
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
and would be hearing
 
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.190 align:start position:0%
and would be hearing
this

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
representative Smith um thank you Mr
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
chairman I I would simply add that the
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals themselves uh sent their their
 
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
lobbyists to testify and support of this
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
um they're asking for our help to craft
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
those policies and I can't think of any
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you any further comments up
 
00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
representative wall thank thank you Mr
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
chairman um I wonder wondering if anyone
 
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
can remember discussions that the house
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
has had this past year on section three
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
uh the cost to for children in a
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
residential facility um there's been
 
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
discussion but for the life of me I
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
can't remember it has anybody got
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
anything Tim Smith have you got
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
something on section three if I can
 
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
respond Mr chairman absolutely go ahead
 
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I I looked into that one a little
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
bit more um we didn't we didn't have any
 
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
legisl for it that I was able to find
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
this year uh but I remember that this
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
question came up during previous terms
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
um but we haven't passed a bill dealing
 
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
with it um there there seemed to be a
 
00:18:43.149 --> 00:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
lot of questions about what we should do
 
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
and you know under under both parties
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
majorities we haven't been able to reach
 
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
any kind of
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
consensus um about how to how to how to
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
handle you know the the education costs
 
00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:54.919 align:start position:0%
for residential
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
facilities I don't have a strong feeling
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
if a commission or a committee is the
 
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
right way to look at that um and I I I
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
hate to punt on that question uh but
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
section three is something that I I
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
agree I think we need to tackle but I'm
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
not entirely sure whether we should go
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
the commission or the committee
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
route thank you representative I will
 
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
point out that on section
 
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.510 align:start position:0%
point out that on section
three

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
um and both and interestingly enough in
 
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
both the house and the Senate um we
 
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
didn't have anyone to introduce it and
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
we didn't have anyone to speak on it um
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
I will I will tell the committee that I
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
I contacted the doe and asked if they
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
would have
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
someone um who would like to speak on on
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
that particular part and um I was
 
00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
told well we'll be monitoring it and
 
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
asking and and answering any questions
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
that come up but no no questions no one
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
testified so there were no questions so
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
um this is I need to point out um in my
 
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.310 align:start position:0%
um this is I need to point out um in my
time

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
here these are
 
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.870 align:start position:0%
here these are
singularly

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
singularly
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
um the most difficult study commission
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
and committee requests that I've ever
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
seen um usually there is some type of
 
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know a purpose statement or
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
intent of each commission um there's
 
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
nothing here this is this these are
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
basically saying we want this commission
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
and trust us um it's important and and
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
not even saying that in so many words um
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
so the testimony was lacking in both the
 
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate um if you go back
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
and watch the um the zoom meetings of
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
the Senate and and the the wording
 
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't stand on its own um so I I have
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
a difficult time representative wall
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I I needed to hear
 
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
that before we go on with any other
 
00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
questions I'm wondering to help us um
 
00:21:18.909 --> 00:21:18.919 align:start position:0%
and knowing that not many people
 
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
testified before us at all when we last
 
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
met uh what does a blue sheet say about
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh Senate Bill 100 who supported and who
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
didn't how many on each side do we know
 
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
do you have the um I must have
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
it do we you know the sheet that signs
 
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
up you're looking confused at the blue
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
sheet um there was a there was a
 
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.549 align:start position:0%
sheet um there was a there was a
testifying

00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.269 align:start position:0%
 
100

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
um on which part now on part three I
 
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
just on on each section because I'm
 
00:21:59.230 --> 00:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
thinking we're beginning to ask a lot of
 
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
questions but it would help to know what
 
00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:03.799 align:start position:0%
kind of public support or nons support
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
sponsors uh and we had one two one so I
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
think a total of four
 
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.549 align:start position:0%
think a total of four
people

00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
testified that includes the sponsors
 
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
aside from the sponsor okay although one
 
00:22:32.669 --> 00:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
was one was a not the prime but a uh
 
00:22:32.679 --> 00:22:34.350 align:start position:0%
was one was a not the prime but a uh
secondary

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
secondary
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
sponsor um and all were
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
lobbyist for an
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
organization no members of the public
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
and we had a total
 
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.149 align:start position:0%
and we had a total
of

00:22:55.149 --> 00:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:22:55.159 --> 00:22:56.950 align:start position:0%
of
um

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.950 align:start position:0%
um
two

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
support Let's see we had
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
one one
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
oppose and the rest support out of
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
nine was that a long list or and that no
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
that do you want that's just a short
 
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
list no I'm just wondering um and that
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
includes the prime prime sponsors um who
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
theoretically would support for the
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
whole bill for the entire bill for a and
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
they were not separated by part number
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
so it's even more difficult to yeah
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I just thought Mr chairman I
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
just thought having that kind of
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
background would help us in terms of
 
00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
whether to go forward with certain
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
questions and all thank you um in
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
addition two of those nine were people
 
00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
that had requested
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
the change or discussed the change in
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
membership of those particular parts
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
that we've already included in that
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment and and I would go further to
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
say I don't have it in with me but my
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
recollection of of the testimony in the
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
Senate followed this path I was I was
 
00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
stunned to see that um they were Senate
 
00:24:15.159 --> 00:24:16.549 align:start position:0%
stunned to see that um they were Senate
bills

00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
and there was a singular lack of
 
00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.669 align:start position:0%
and there was a singular lack of
testimony

00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
so uh hands up no don't see any oh
 
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:28.669 align:start position:0%
so uh hands up no don't see any oh
representative

00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
rard thank you Mr chair um I have a
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
question for representative Smith uh and
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
I want to go back
 
00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
please oh I wanted to ask representative
 
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
Smith if if he were looking at section
 
00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:46.039 align:start position:0%
one of Senate Bill 100 to be uh
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
establishing a commission versus a
 
00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
committee representative Smith do you
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
have a I think you did mention this
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
whether it should be a commission or
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
Committee in your mind but yeah the the
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
issue becomes that um a committee can
 
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
only include members of the legislature
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
and a commission can include outside
 
00:25:09.149 --> 00:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
parties whereas the hospitals are
 
00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
looking to include input from a number
 
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
of groups you know that are enumerated
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
in the text to section one that are
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
outside the
 
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
legislature um by definition it kind of
 
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
has to be a commission uh rather than a
 
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
committee um so that's that's just due
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
to the makeup you know like they're
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
trying to get people in from like the
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
National Association of mental illness
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire Healthcare Association
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that and we can't include
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
those members if it's a if it's a
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
legislative study committee follow up
 
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
but the the net output um essentially
 
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
would be very similar either way it
 
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
would be recommendations you know for
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
for policy for the hospital
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
organizations uh but if it's if it's a
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
committee versus a commission they can't
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
pull in those extra folks followup
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh the question would be though they
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
would be able to bring in those
 
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
individuals from those various groups
 
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
that would be part of a commission and
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
then they would be at that point as a
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
committee able to put forward
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
legislation as a result of the testimony
 
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
before the committee so that's why I was
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
thinking they could do a committee
 
00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
versus a
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
commission follow up representative
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
Smith yeah my my understanding was um
 
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
based on the the testim and the emails
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
we got that they were looking for uh
 
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
policy recommendations that weren't
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily um going to be entirely
 
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
legislative in nature um whereas you
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
know a legislative study
 
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
committee ostensibly exists for the
 
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of recommending legislation um
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
or legislative changes the commission
 
00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
would have a little bit broader of a
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
mandate where they could recommend like
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
institutional policy you know outside of
 
00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
the rsas which seems to be what they
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
were looking for um you know those would
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
be recommendations they wouldn't be
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
binding or anything like that so I don't
 
00:27:05.789 --> 00:27:05.799 align:start position:0%
you know if this was going to have like
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
binding policy I would be a little
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
concerned you know that that would seem
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
a little heavy-handed uh but they're
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
they're just looking for recommendations
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
which seems entirely
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate followup followup yeah um my
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
question would be if they're looking for
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
policy positions as a group and as a
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
hospital entity in the state they may be
 
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
able to do those policies now with all
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
the meetings that they have so my I
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
think you just reinforced my my position
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
that if they're coming to the
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
legislature uh for
 
00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:42.039 align:start position:0%
legislation um it would be helpful to
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
have a committee the commission really
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
is looking for policy so I think that
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
solidifies my position it should be a
 
00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
study committee rather than a commission
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
you any further comment ments questions
 
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:01.559 align:start position:0%
discussion on
 
00:28:01.559 --> 00:28:03.269 align:start position:0%
discussion on
Amendment

00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:09.149 align:start position:0%
Amendment
1554

00:28:09.149 --> 00:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
H up I do have a question um since there
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
seems to be folks um representative
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
Smith in particular that would like to
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
see a change to this is there a plan to
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
do an amendment to
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
this I don't know I don't know
 
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:34.509 align:start position:0%
this I don't know I don't know
either

00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:34.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.509 --> 00:28:36.519 align:start position:0%
I'll raise my hand Mr chairman I guess
 
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
okay um I'll say uh if perhaps someone U
 
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
maybe representative wall um could
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
volunteer over lunch or over a break
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
just to scoot down to
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
OS I I would be happy to send something
 
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
over I mean anything I would recommend
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
would be extremely simple the the
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
amendment as drafted is fine I would
 
00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
just like to re include section one that
 
00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
should be uh a relatively simple change
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
for them representative wall may I ask
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative Smith a question please
 
00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely represent Smith um
 
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
specifically what changes would you want
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
how would you get that information to us
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
we're sitting here in person what how
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
can you help
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
us um I mean there's no there's no
 
00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:21.710 align:start position:0%
us um I mean there's no there's no
wording

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
wording
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
changes that would need to be made it
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
would just be a simple matter of
 
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
reincluded text that's already there in
 
00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
bill that that should be something that
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
that OS can do without needing extensive
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
notes interpret for me please um yes I
 
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
think I can um and correct me if I'm
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
wrong representative Smith what he would
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
like to do um where the amendment
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
removes part
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
one he would like to reestablish part
 
00:30:00.029 --> 00:30:00.039 align:start position:0%
one in in in the amendment so that
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
everything that shows up in Senate Bill
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
100 for part one would be in the
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
amendment so there would
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
be um in its entirety I don't I don't
 
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
think he was making any changes to to um
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
the part one as it shows in Senate Bill
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
100 he was just merely um reintroducing
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
that where where the amendment removes
 
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
it yep I ask representative Smith the
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
question pleas absolutely so um I
 
00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:35.519 align:start position:0%
thought our discussion last time we met
 
00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:37.519 align:start position:0%
was that many of these Health Care
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
settings are setting up their own rules
 
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
for how to manage things at this time
 
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
and I thought there was discussion and
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
please correct me if I'm wrong and I
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
could be that that was something we
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
would let the health care industry
 
00:30:59.310 --> 00:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
handle on their own and am I wrong yeah
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
they're um they specifically you know
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
asked for this language um they want a
 
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
legislative commission uh you know to
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
include members of the legislature to be
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
part of this group in case any
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations come out of it that
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
involve you know uh necessary changes to
 
00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:18.029 align:start position:0%
involve you know uh necessary changes to
any

00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:18.039 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
rsas um which is why they were asking
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
for you know the legislature to form
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
this rather than just make some
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
independent group
 
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
themselves so let me ask a question
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative Smith would there be in
 
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
know if it sounds to me like uh they
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
were proposing or your interpretation of
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
this is they were proposing a a fishing
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
expedition to look for possible
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
solutions and and I'm asking
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
you would there be any reason why that
 
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
fishing Expedition couldn't take place
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
in the for form of an ad hoc
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
committee um established by who was the
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor of that part
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
um Senator Waters yes no Senator gray oh
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
I was looking at Senate Bill 100 in it
 
00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
as a whole right but but part one is
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
sponsored by Senator gray so would there
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
be any reason why Senator gray couldn't
 
00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
establish over the summer if they he
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to um Andor
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
next September a an
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
independent original
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
Bill to do exactly what you're saying to
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
create that fishing
 
00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.509 align:start position:0%
create that fishing
Expedition

00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
um as as it sits Now by this amendment I
 
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
would have to defer that to the senator
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
okay I understand but we don't know of
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
any reason why it couldn't be
 
00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:58.269 align:start position:0%
any reason why it couldn't be
done

00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:33:00.509 --> 00:33:00.519 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if I could just interject on
 
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
on process um for any um further
 
00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
amendments that that that the committee
 
00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
might want I'd be happy to um you know
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
handle that here from my office and you
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
know ol attorneys are are mostly working
 
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
remotely still so it's it's not sort of
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
the same um you know run across the
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
street and uh and deal with them
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
directly um system so we've got a good
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
electronic system set up and I think
 
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
it'd be faster if if um and easier all
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
around if I just processed any anything
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
that you you want thank you Pam yes that
 
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not yet but I appreciate the input
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
um I see a hand up of uh uh
 
00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.149 align:start position:0%
um I see a hand up of uh uh
representative

00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
mckenny yes thank you Mr chairman um I I
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
testify to uh have a commission because
 
00:33:56.799 --> 00:33:57.470 align:start position:0%
testify to uh have a commission because
the

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:00.629 --> 00:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
the the the bill called for um a
 
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
committee to study and they wanted to be
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
involved so I should think if we took
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
this their Pro problem was they didn't
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
want to be blindsided by something so I
 
00:34:10.399 --> 00:34:13.069 align:start position:0%
want to be blindsided by something so I
would

00:34:13.069 --> 00:34:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
think ah you're skipping in and out here
 
00:34:15.919 --> 00:34:20.349 align:start position:0%
think ah you're skipping in and out here
representative

00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
I um could you yep you're un I lost you
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
now where are you up there uh pres
 
00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
mckenny you're
 
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
muted oh thank you I didn't do that it
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
just Bean at me um I I think that they
 
00:34:38.349 --> 00:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
were testifying to the commission
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
didn't their intention was they wanted
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
to do their own rules and at least make
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
sure that that you weren't doing
 
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
something the legislature wasn't doing
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
something I I think leaving this first
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
part out is uh probably a good idea and
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
then if that's a problem then as the
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
former speaker said it's so easy to put
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
a bill in for fall and U you have a
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
commission so I I I wouldn't be in favor
 
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
of running around for an amendment at
 
00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:13.630 align:start position:0%
of running around for an amendment at
this

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:13.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
time thank you representative wall thank
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so um part one deals
 
00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
with violence in the workplace for
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
healthc care workers and we didn't
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
really have testimony on that um now
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's in the original bill that came to
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
us from the senate representative green
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
wants to remove that representa Smith
 
00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
wants to put it back in so do we need an
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
amendment to put it back in if
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
we don't support thank you does that
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
negate representative Smith's point of
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
view right we would if if we what he is
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
proposing represent and correct me
 
00:35:56.109 --> 00:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
representative Smith if I'm misapplying
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
your your statement I do see your hand
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
I'll get to you immediately
 
00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.870 align:start position:0%
I'll get to you immediately
um

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
the he's proposing that we amend the
 
00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
amendment to to reestablish part
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
one but Mr chairman we haven't voted on
 
00:36:16.829 --> 00:36:16.839 align:start position:0%
the amendment we have not it is under
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
discussion at the moment so he's
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
thinking in advance that that may pass
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
and that he then wants to amend it if
 
00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
that passes he wants he wants the
 
00:36:27.069 --> 00:36:27.079 align:start position:0%
amendment I believe he wants the he
 
00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
would suggest not he s he's would
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
suggest that the amendment be withdrawn
 
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
amended and then brought back
 
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
representative Smith um the the
 
00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
procedural sequence would be pretty
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
flexible I mean if the amendment failed
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
um I I would support just resubmitting
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment slightly modified to
 
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
re-include section one I me the rest of
 
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
these changes as I said um were pretty
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
well reasoned and I I can get on board
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
100% and the other sections that we're
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
removing um you know as you said I mean
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
we couldn't even get the prime sponsor
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
to show up and support it so it it can't
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
be that important um and if if the
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
amendment passes um you know it would be
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
a simple matter to draft a further
 
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
amendment that would just add back in
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
part one and and take that up separately
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
and that that' be you know an acceptable
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:27.190 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:37:31.309 --> 00:37:31.319 align:start position:0%
I think uh I think we should um
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
up representative speedia I don't even
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
see him there he is right yes so I just
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to make a quick comment too I
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
think um thank you Mr chair I I I I
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
think with what um you know I was
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
reading through the Senate notes and I
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
think there I mean there is emergency in
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
the sense of you know this bill was I
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
mean this this Comm this Commission
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
would have been passed last session but
 
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic we had you know
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of our bills went to the pandemic
 
00:38:08.829 --> 00:38:08.839 align:start position:0%
graveyard but um you know this the the
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
way they talked about in the Senate
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
notes was that you know the urgency has
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
climbed even high it's climbed even
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
higher and it's only gotten worse um and
 
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:20.200 align:start position:0%
that you know they even asked if if
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals were one of the or just
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
Healthcare settings were one of the you
 
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
know more dangerous PL workplaces in in
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
and industries and I just think sorry um
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
and I just think that we you know
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
clearly there is there is there feel
 
00:38:37.309 --> 00:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
like there is a need for this and so I'm
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
you know I'm hoping that we can go
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
through the process of adding it you
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
know getting a new Amendment and and
 
00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
make adding it to it um because I I just
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
feel like this is and it passed through
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate so with you know with a lot
 
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
with support so I just I think it's a
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
good good idea um and I think it you
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
know for the the sake of our healthcare

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:04.760 align:start position:0%

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
passing the amendment now we have
 
00:42:39.069 --> 00:42:39.079 align:start position:0%
um a new I'm looking for a new motion of
 
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended on Senate Bill
 
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
100 Mr
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
chairman yes um I I would move that we
 
00:42:50.589 --> 00:42:50.599 align:start position:0%
recess for a little while so that Pam
 
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
smling can ask OS to draft a further
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh
 
00:42:59.549 --> 00:42:59.559 align:start position:0%
um and maybe move on to the next bill
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
and come back to this in a few minutes
 
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
exec I will uh to what and
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative Smith um we that bill I'm
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
assuming that amendment that um that Pam
 
00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
creates would add that back in yeah
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's the intent and and we just had a
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
vote without it that
 
00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.589 align:start position:0%
vote without it that
passed

00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
passed
 
00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:34.839 align:start position:0%
right so if we create an amendment to
 
00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
bring it
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
in um I got to believe that the the vote
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
would be um identifiable but I'm happy
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
if you would like to cck us for a few
 
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
minutes and we will as
 
00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:52.839 align:start position:0%
well yeah that's
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
fine okay um I would just want to add um
 
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman that I I have spoken to OSS
 
00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
about how quickly amendments can be
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
turned around and it's I was told that
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
it was highly unlikely no matter even if
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
it was a simple change of an effective
 
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
date um that it would be done um in
 
00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
anything less than an hour and and
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
perhaps longer than that because of the
 
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
Log Jam of amendments being requested
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
for the Senate finance committee and and
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
other things going on so I know
 
00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
that we sometimes in the past have had
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
relatively quick turnaround in a
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
situation like this it could happen but
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
um there are no
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
promises Mr chairman I'll I'll withdraw
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
my motion for a recess in that case if
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be able to get it
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
back to us you know potentially today i'
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
I'd hate to see us you know in some
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
weird situation where we're just waiting
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
around twiddling our thumbs for three
 
00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
hours well I I will offer to you
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
that um in anticipation of this I
 
00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
have scheduled you'll see in the
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
calendar that comes out tonight I've
 
00:45:11.549 --> 00:45:11.559 align:start position:0%
scheduled um a what I call it just in
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
case um executive session for next
 
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
Monday um so I don't want you to I don't
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
want to PR preclude you from filing
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
whatever Amendment you would like um on
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
the interest of time we we do have that
 
00:45:34.829 --> 00:45:34.839 align:start position:0%
ability to um reschedule for Monday
 
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
so it's not um I I I offer that for your
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
consideration and if you would still
 
00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.309 align:start position:0%
consideration and if you would still
like

00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
caucus we certainly
 
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
can I'll say that I can't speak for
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
everyone else um in in the Democrats but
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't really see any for a
 
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:57.640 align:start position:0%
caucus I mean this
 
00:45:59.790 --> 00:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
um adding in an amendment just to
 
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
restore section one I mean you know if
 
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
we don't have the time in committee it
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
can just try that on the floor or
 
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
something um this isn't uh a really
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
complicated Bill and we've already
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
talked about the section in committee so
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
I I think you know if yourself or
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
someone else from the committee wanted
 
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
to go up and present a counterargument
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
for that on the floor that you know
 
00:46:20.589 --> 00:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:23.559 align:start position:0%
routine okay are we
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay so you're ready to do the whole
 
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
bill then I was I was moving ahead to
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as
 
00:46:33.549 --> 00:46:33.559 align:start position:0%
amended may speak yes um for the
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
committee um I didn't like that that
 
00:46:40.349 --> 00:46:40.359 align:start position:0%
portion was pulled out by the
 
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
amendment but I think the rest of the
 
00:46:46.109 --> 00:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
bill is important enough that we need to
 
00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
pass Senate Bill 100 um in the Senate it
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
the entire bill passed 24 to nothing
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
bipartisan vote
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
V and for one portion of
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
it to kill the whole bill I think is
 
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
problematic even though I agree with my
 
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
own party
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
um I I have to vote to pass this because
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
the rest of it's that
 
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
important thank you ref follow your
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
conscience I I would I would
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
add that part of part of the thought
 
00:47:27.309 --> 00:47:27.319 align:start position:0%
process in removing part one
 
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
was was if we left it in and killed the
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
entire bill that would
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
preclude part one from coming back next
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
year and being sent
 
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
to the correct committee to address it I
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
I have to keep coming back to the idea
 
00:47:53.069 --> 00:47:53.079 align:start position:0%
that this is partially or maybe even
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
mostly the Senate's doing by
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
by assigning seemingly unrelated bills
 
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
the only relation that they have to one
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
another is the fact that they are either
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
committees or
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
commissions and and then it being sent
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
to a committee that has nothing to do
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
with any of the subject matter in any of
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
these parts so it seems to me the kind
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
thing to do is
 
00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
to um politely ask them to do it again
 
00:48:31.549 --> 00:48:31.559 align:start position:0%
by reintroducing that bill next term the
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
only way to do
 
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
that is to remove it from the bill
 
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
because otherwise we would be killing it
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
and then it can't come back by house
 
00:48:47.069 --> 00:48:47.079 align:start position:0%
rules for next term so I I actually
 
00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
think we're doing a kindness by removing
 
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
it if if in some perverted kind of way
 
00:48:55.549 --> 00:48:55.559 align:start position:0%
here am I it's understand you're saying
 
00:48:58.789 --> 00:48:58.799 align:start position:0%
killing with kindness Mr chairman I'm
 
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
thinking that removing with kindness I
 
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
guess by um having voted 8 to six to
 
00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
remove that
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
section uh can see how the vote may go
 
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
on ought to pass as amended uh this bill
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
clearly will go to Committee of
 
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
conference that being said there will be
 
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
discussion on that section and perhaps
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
some members of our committee might have
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
their arms twisted to put it back in at
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
that time um it will go to committee
 
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
conference in other words the door is
 
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.069 align:start position:0%
conference in other words the door is
still

00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:49:34.829 --> 00:49:34.839 align:start position:0%
open the
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
um there are there are our vote does not
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
close any doors um it it merely it one
 
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
possibility could be Committee of
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
conference yeah um one possibility is
 
00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:52.799 align:start position:0%
they would they would take as as you
 
00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
just said a minute ago they may take
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
everything and say
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
um there is nothing precluding us from
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
resubmitting this next term there is
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
no as as the Senate is want to do and
 
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
maybe for some of the newer people um
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
there I would not be surprised if the
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
language from this gets added to
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
something else um in the Senate of a
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
house bill and and comes back that way
 
00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
um there are any number of possibilities
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
that can
 
00:50:31.789 --> 00:50:31.799 align:start position:0%
happen um removing it from Senate Bill
 
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
100 as
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
amended um by no means is the end of the
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
line for this bill so
 
00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:45.319 align:start position:0%
um while it was removed for kindness to
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
give them the ability to to fix it um or
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
or resubmit it um that's that was the
 
00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
the position that the amendment took I
 
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
see a hand for representative Smith
 
00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I would I'd add
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
some comments generally in agreement um
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
with what the chairman said that the the
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
situation that we're kind of stuck in
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
because of this Omnibus
 
00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.069 align:start position:0%
because of this Omnibus
legislation

00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
um puts us in a difficult spot and and
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned last week I you know I
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
think it does a disservice to the
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that we're kind of forced
 
00:51:28.349 --> 00:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
to to take these issues up in Omnibus
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
bills rather than having them go out to
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
the the policy committees that might be
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
a little bit more appropriate you know
 
00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
it's obvious that the speaker's office
 
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
just sent us these Omnibus study
 
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
committee bills because they study
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
committee bills not because of the
 
00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
subject matter in them right um and
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
that's that's not really anyone's fault
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
I mean we're the victim of global
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances at the moment um and i'
 
00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
I'd remind folks on the committee that
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
you know pretty much regardless of what
 
00:51:59.309 --> 00:51:59.319 align:start position:0%
we do unless we itl the bill um as the
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
chairman said nothing is going to be
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
dispositive and prevent anything from
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
getting addressed either on the floor as
 
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
amendment to other legislation or next
 
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
year in in a separate individual bill so
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
we're we're stuck in this situation
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
where our options are limited but we
 
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
don't really have bad options that you
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
know anything we do is not going to
 
00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily close any doors unless we I
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
it the whole bill and since the pending
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass I'm not super
 
00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
worried about that um so yeah I mean I I
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
guess I can support and ought to pass
 
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
and i' I'd urge other people to do so as
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
well simply because of the you know the
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
difficult situation we find ourselves in
 
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
from a a procedural and institutional
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
standpoint we're doing the best we
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
can I I think I agree wholeheartedly
 
00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
with that and and um and I think further
 
00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
I will say it was none of our doing to
 
00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
put us in this position and and we're
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
doing um the kindest things we possibly
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
can so um again I I you know if part one
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
is the sticking
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
point I I firmly believe um that what
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
we're doing is
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
saying um we don't like how you did it
 
00:53:31.789 --> 00:53:31.799 align:start position:0%
please do it again or we're giving you
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
the ability to do it again um and and
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
stick it on something else and send it
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
back to us not specifically to us but
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully to the US that um handles the
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate committee that handles that
 
00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
this type of situation so that's that's
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
the last word as far as I see um with
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
that I'll ask the clerk to call the role
 
00:53:59.230 --> 00:53:59.240 align:start position:0%
on ought to pass as amended on Senate
 
00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:09.309 align:start position:0%
on ought to pass as amended on Senate
Bill

00:54:09.309 --> 00:54:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
100 should we not have a motion to
 
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
reconsider first no um no we're fine
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
okay we're fine thank
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome to make a motion but
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%

legislation uh we had no findings to
 
00:58:05.789 --> 00:58:05.799 align:start position:0%
make anyone sure the problem needs
 
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
legislative Solutions and also the
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
removal allows a solitary Bill to be
 
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
filled next year that would be under the
 
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
control of more appropriate committee
 
00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:20.920 align:start position:0%

this amendment also removes part two
 
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:25.640 align:start position:0%
which is really a work force housing
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
issue I feel it's more appropriately
 
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:30.200 align:start position:0%
handled at the local level we reached
 
00:58:32.829 --> 00:58:32.839 align:start position:0%
out many times but never got any input
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
on this part of the Omnibus from the we
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
reached out to the chair Municipal
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
County several times we didn't hear back
 
00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
H finally the amendment will uh
 
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
reestablish part three uh the uh the
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%

Omnibus enough the warrant
 
00:58:57.870 --> 00:58:57.880 align:start position:0%

for representative Smith yep thank you
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I would point out that
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
yet again we are removing the only part
 
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
that anyone seemed to testify in support
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
of part one the uh post-traumatic stress
 
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
disorders for First Responders um this
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
is the only part of the bill that uh I
 
01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
received any any feedback or comment or
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
testimony on that was supportive at all
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
um you know I I always get very upset
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
when we act against the will of the
 
01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
public here in the legislature we're
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
here through the consent of the Govern
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
and this is the only part of this bill
 
01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
that they seemed to care enough about to
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
reach out and actively support and uh
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
here we are with an amendment to remove
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
it um I I can't think of any good reason
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
to do that and I'll be voting against
 
01:01:09.029 --> 01:01:09.039 align:start position:0%
the amendment very strongly for all the
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
same reasons outlined on the previous
 
01:01:13.029 --> 01:01:13.039 align:start position:0%
bills uh
 
01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:16.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you representative
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
Smith representative rouard thank you Mr
 
01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
chair um one of the questions uh that
 
01:01:27.549 --> 01:01:27.559 align:start position:0%
came up was the issue of the mental
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
health training focusing on
 
01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:35.039 align:start position:0%
PTSD and whether or not that would put
 
01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:38.839 align:start position:0%
the cost burden on the local communities
 
01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
uh kind of a 28a issue unfunded mandate
 
01:01:46.029 --> 01:01:46.039 align:start position:0%
and the concern of that uh was a concern
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
of mine as well and although this this
 
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
commission did come from the Senate once
 
01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
again in this Omnibus legislation uh I
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
am concerned about that issue um and we
 
01:02:01.269 --> 01:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
have I guess an amendment here before us
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
that removes that because uh doesn't
 
01:02:06.829 --> 01:02:06.839 align:start position:0%
remove the 28 issue a issue it removes
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
paragraph one which also in my mind
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
removes the 28a issue as well which was
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
a real problem for that bill for me so
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
um I I support the grand families I
 
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
think it's an important piece of
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
legislation we heard from uh Senators uh
 
01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:26.039 align:start position:0%
spefic specifically what the commission
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
would do if it went forward and that was
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
very compelling um I I I think there may
 
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
be some issues and perhaps it's
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
recognized we've got a problem with the
 
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
28a and the funding for mental health
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
training um and I think that perhaps
 
01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
some of the sponsors and the folks that
 
01:02:46.029 --> 01:02:46.039 align:start position:0%
want this legislation to go forward
 
01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
understand and recognize that so
 
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
although I appreciate that it's an
 
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
important issue once again it can go
 
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
back to the labor department
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
that has dealt with this and passing the
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
legislation um the way it is and the
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
amendment which removes it allows them
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
to bring this legislation back forward
 
01:03:09.269 --> 01:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
go to the correct committee perhaps deal
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
with the issue of 28a and get a
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
consensus of all the individuals there
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
and so I am in support of this amendment
 
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
and not of reestablishing the commission
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
for PTSD for for responders at this time
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
I am I am very much in support of First
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
Responders and and what they need but
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
the way that this um commission was
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
established and its charge is not
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
something I can
 
01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
support thank you
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
01:03:44.109 --> 01:03:44.119 align:start position:0%
asedia thank you Mr chair and I just you
 
01:03:47.269 --> 01:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
know for the record you know I think I
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
think our First Responders are doing a
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
tough job right now um I think covid has
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
been really really hard for so many of
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
our First Responders um and I think you
 
01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
know we've all had to struggle with
 
01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
mental health um as we've you know been
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
been isolated but at the same time you
 
01:04:09.069 --> 01:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
know it's it's been it's been tough and
 
01:04:11.069 --> 01:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
you know even before the pandemic it was
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
for these First Responders so you know
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
supporting I I'm in support of making
 
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
sure that we have you know part one and
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
the other thing is you know with part
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
two with work with workfor Workforce
 
01:04:27.069 --> 01:04:27.079 align:start position:0%
house housing like you know we we that
 
01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
is one of the biggest issues we have in
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
the state right now of retaining our
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
young families and young people um and I
 
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
was and I was I was just back in in
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
California recently and I said like one
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
of the reason I wouldn't never move back
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
is I could never afford the the house I
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
grew up in um and that is not you know
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
that is not unlike some of the cases
 
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire where there are
 
01:04:53.309 --> 01:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
folks who cannot afford the houses the
 
01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:55.480 align:start position:0%
to live in the community they grew up in
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
anymore um and it's you know it hurts
 
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
our state it's it's you know more people
 
01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:05.079 align:start position:0%
are leaving um and so I am I am
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
concerned that we you know by removing
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
part two we are we are hurting our
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
chances of retaining people in our state
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
so um you know I'm I'm going to be
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
voting against this amendment but I am
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm disturbed that we are we are
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
trying to remove part one and also part
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
two of of this Commission this uh
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative who hasn't spoken here
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
representor wall thank you Mr chairman
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm not altogether sure that we have
 
01:05:42.029 --> 01:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
a 28a issue in part one all First
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
Responders have to go through regular
 
01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
training have it updated and such every
 
01:05:50.349 --> 01:05:50.359 align:start position:0%
single year and I believe that um
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
looking at post-traumatic stress
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
disorder during the training or prior to
 
01:05:59.710 --> 01:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
the training should be a very important
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
part of uh these people's careers
 
01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
and there's so much we don't know and
 
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
are still learning about
 
01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.589 align:start position:0%
are still learning about
PTSD

01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
PTSD
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
and we don't know for sure whether
 
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
people have it when they go into the
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
training or whether it occurs while
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
they're training there's a horrific
 
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
incident or something so I think it's
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
well wor looking at um and again I
 
01:06:28.589 --> 01:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
remind the committee
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
that with discussion in the Senate and
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
considering it had bipartisan support
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
straight through it also passed the
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
Senate on a bipartisan level 24 to
 
01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
nothing um and I do believe that the
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
Senate took considerable care in putting
 
01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
these issues together in this bill uh
 
01:06:50.829 --> 01:06:50.839 align:start position:0%
for example part three the grand
 
01:06:53.549 --> 01:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
families is a huge issue I personally
 
01:06:55.029 --> 01:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
think that that almost ought to be a
 
01:06:55.039 --> 01:06:56.190 align:start position:0%
think that that almost ought to be a
permanent

01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
commission um just as years ago there
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
was the commission on the status of
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
women for one year two years whatever
 
01:07:05.309 --> 01:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
and it kept getting bigger and bigger
 
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:07.640 align:start position:0%
and finally became a full-time
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
commission and I don't even think I it's
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
morphed into something now but it became
 
01:07:16.589 --> 01:07:16.599 align:start position:0%
it it came out of issues regarding women
 
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
in the workplace and this that and the
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
other women's health care and such um so
 
01:07:23.549 --> 01:07:23.559 align:start position:0%
for the grand families bit we know
 
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
that's going to be an ongoing problem
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
sociologically speaking and economically
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
speaking in our state in our country um
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
but going back to part
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
one um I I do believe that we need to
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
keep that portion in I'll leave it at
 
01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative um
 
01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
representative Smith your hand is up
 
01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so in regards to
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
any potential 28a issues I I I would say
 
01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:52.910 align:start position:0%
any potential 28a issues I I I would say
first

01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
that an amendment or language in the
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
amendment that would just remove the
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
section that someone is concerned would
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
cause a 28a issue would be more
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate than just removing all of
 
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
part one you know we're we're throwing
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
the baby out with the
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
bathat and further um the section in
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
part one that I don't think could raise
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
a 28a issue but someone could think that
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
um says that the programs will be
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
developed by the New Hampshire police
 
01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
Academy and the New Hampshire fire
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
academy respectively those are
 
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
institutions that these professionals
 
01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
already receive training and credentials
 
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
from um without anyone anywhere at any
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
level that I've ever heard claiming that
 
01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:42.799 align:start position:0%
that like overrides local Authority or
 
01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
tramples on local control or presents a
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
28a issue you know this is just adding
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
to training they already receive from
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
institutions they already get trained by
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
um so I don't I don't see how that could
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
present any issue myself I I understand
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
someone else might disagree that's fine
 
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
um and again you know we're removing the
 
01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
only part of the bill uh that anyone
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
from the public seemed to care about so
 
01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
I I can't possibly support this
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
you representative I'll point out um I
 
01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
received a letter and I think we all did
 
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
from the president of the professional
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
firefighters of New Hampshire I think
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
just yesterday yesterday yesterday that
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
one line of it says um we understand
 
01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
there have been some concerns raised to
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
the educational component and
 
01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
possibility of creating an unfunded
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
mandate understanding this we have
 
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
spoken with Senator bsel and happy to
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
amend this bill to remove the five
 
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
fiveyear required training component as
 
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
this may be the only component with a
 
01:09:54.669 --> 01:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
cost associated with it
 
01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
so anyway he so I it sounds like he is
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
as I read it he is um understanding that
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
there may be a 28a issue um anyway NE uh
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
comments I see no
 
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
hands Yes actually Mr chairman thank you
 
01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
given that letter that he sent and he's
 
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
removing that um but wants to keep the
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
rest of that section what does that do
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
amended I don't know the the bill
 
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
eliminates the entire 28a uh the
 
01:10:48.189 --> 01:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
amendment eliminates the entire 28a
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
issue because it eliminates the entire
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
section okay and again with the same
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
discussion that we had in the prior
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
bill um it
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
is it is uh to use your phrase killing
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
with kindness um by removing rather than
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
iing um it it's almost is it in the same
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
regard of when we um in the second term
 
01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
um we handle bills that we don't want to
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
kill outright um this is this is I think
 
01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
if I am speaking somewhat for um the
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
amendment um or the writer of the
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
amendment this is doing similar thing
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
that we did in in Senate Bill 100 which
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
is giving the ability for this to return
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
in any number of Fashions either adding
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
on to something else and then and then
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
or um coming back as a separate bill and
 
01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
or doing an ad hoc committee over the
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
summer with the idea of doing it um as a
 
01:12:04.629 --> 01:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
separate bill all with the idea that it
 
01:12:09.149 --> 01:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
has to go it this needs to be spoken
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
to by the committee that is used to
 
01:12:18.669 --> 01:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
handling these situations not us um so
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
again I'm I'm pointing the finger back
 
01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
at who whose decision it was to create
 
01:12:26.189 --> 01:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
these Omnibus
 
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
legislative tools it serves no purpose
 
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
it doesn't help the the the legislation
 
01:12:38.110 --> 01:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't H help the prime sponsor of
 
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
that legislation and it doesn't help the
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
general public um
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
so I'm I think merely if I can
 
01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
paraphrase the amendment it is um we're
 
01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
not against these things but we would
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
like you to to do it better um and and
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
give it back to us that's that's at
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
least my understanding of the Amendments
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
um it is it is by no means trying to
 
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
downplay the importance of our First
 
01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
Responders or their training it is to
 
01:13:23.709 --> 01:13:23.719 align:start position:0%
say um you've got to do better in um and
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
and it needs to have a full vetting by
 
01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
the the people that are experts in this
 
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
area and that is not the legislative
 
01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
I um not not at this time we're we're in
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
executive session um so I have uh I see
 
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
that hand up of you know that when you
 
01:13:59.229 --> 01:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
raise your right hand uh Senator uh
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
representative Smith it goes right
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
behind the the state house there you go
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
yeah it's hard from this distance for me
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
to see it thanks very much uh the floor
 
01:14:09.719 --> 01:14:10.470 align:start position:0%
to see it thanks very much uh the floor
is

01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
yours yeah um I I got to take issue with
 
01:14:17.629 --> 01:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
with one thing you you said Mr chairman
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
um the amendment strips out two-thirds
 
01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
of the bill we are making a statement
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
we're we're not failing to make a
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
statement about importance we're not
 
01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
saying that these sections are
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
unimportant we are saying these sections
 
01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
are unimportant because we're keeping
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
part three about the grand families so
 
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
what we're doing with this amendment is
 
01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
we're saying that this issue with the
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
grand families is more important than
 
01:14:48.629 --> 01:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
these other two sections and deserves
 
01:14:50.669 --> 01:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
our attention as our committee and you
 
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
know I'm presuming this passes then
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
through the the attention of the house
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
to create this commission or reestablish
 
01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
this commission I'm
 
01:15:01.709 --> 01:15:01.719 align:start position:0%
sorry whereas the commission to study
 
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
barriers to increase landan development
 
01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
and the commission to study
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress disorder and First
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
Responders do not deserve our attention
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
at this time because right now we have
 
01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to address these and
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
handle them an amendment could have been
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
made that made minor tweaks to the
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
language without removing it that might
 
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
have satisfied concerns that members of
 
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
the committee had but that's not what
 
01:15:28.629 --> 01:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
we're voting on we're voting on removing
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
the language entirely we are making a
 
01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
statement through this amendment that
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
those sections are less important than
 
01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
the section that we are keeping in the
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
bill now while it is true that we're not
 
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
making an itl on these sections we're
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
removing we're just taking no action but
 
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
we are very much making a statement that
 
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
one section onethird of this is more
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
important higher prior priority gets
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
more attention than the other two parts
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
um I disagree with that statement I
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
think that all three sections of this
 
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
bill are important I think it's wildly
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
inappropriate as I've said that we're
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
removing the only section we received
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
public input and support from um and I I
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
can't possibly support this amendment uh
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
for those reasons um in terms of a
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
motion on the underlying Bill we're not
 
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
there yet but I would support anything
 
01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:36.669 --> 01:16:36.679 align:start position:0%
wall okay here we go um representative
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
Smith makes some strong points and um
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking right now where so much
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
public attention is being given to First
 
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
Responders and to
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
PTSD uh the public is very much aware
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
that we're working on something and my
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
concern as public perception if we kill
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
this portion if we go along rather with
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment to kill that portion of
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
the bill uh I'm concerned that public
 
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
perception would be that we're just not
 
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
supporting First Responders as we
 
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps ought to um I fully agree with
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
the chairman that this can go exactly
 
01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
the same way the other one did in terms
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
of being attached to another bill or
 
01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
coming back next year but I think
 
01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
there's a certain urgency right now in
 
01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of how we're looking at those
 
01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
people who are out there uh with covid
 
01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
and such trying to help us through this
 
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
crisis that we've got and I I want to
 
01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
show support for our First Responders in
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
every way we can
 
01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
so again I understand that
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
by adopting this amendment we wouldn't
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
really kill anything but at the same
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
time on a positive level I'd rather say
 
01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
look we stand up for you we're doing
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
what we can to help support you in what
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
you're doing and any disorder that you
 
01:17:59.950 --> 01:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
might have related to your job in some
 
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
way so um I am going to I appreciate the
 
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
work that representative green has put
 
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
into this I really do and I appreciate
 
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
all the remarks everyone has
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
made but I'm going to vote against this
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
amendment however I will vote for the
 
01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
bill as amended because it's
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
important thank you representative I
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
I I would I think I would agree with you
 
01:18:28.239 --> 01:18:29.270 align:start position:0%
I I would I think I would agree with you
were

01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
this anything other than a commission we
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
had had the conversation just last week
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
that committees and
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
commissions um
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
rarely are doing something you know they
 
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
are so so I understand your point and I
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
would agree with you wholeheartedly if
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
actually we were
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
um we
 
01:18:58.629 --> 01:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
were yeah doing something you know yeah
 
01:19:01.149 --> 01:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
so anyway may I give a quick response to
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman um what I'd like
 
01:19:07.950 --> 01:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
to may I speak thank you yes I fully
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
agree with everything that we have
 
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
discussed prior to this and today um and
 
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
I I'm not one who is fond of commissions
 
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
at all I don't think any of us is but I
 
01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
think I've read in the information from
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
Pam smling that this Commission has met
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
20 times and they've been moving forward
 
01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:27.229 align:start position:0%
20 times and they've been moving forward
uh

01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
regularly um it sounds like this is a
 
01:19:33.229 --> 01:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
very proactive one um I certainly
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want it to go on forever and
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
ever and ever but at the same time if it
 
01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
sounds like they're trying very hard
 
01:19:41.709 --> 01:19:41.719 align:start position:0%
that all the members of the commission
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
are actively involved are attending the
 
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
meetings and are trying to find answers
 
01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
to these problems that we have so in
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
this sense I this is one Commission I
 
01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.350 align:start position:0%
this sense I this is one Commission I
will

01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
support thank you representative
 
01:20:00.030 --> 01:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
speedia thank you Mr chair yeah I I was
 
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
going to say I sat on the before this
 
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
committee I sat on the labor committee
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
and I did know that this um the
 
01:20:09.149 --> 01:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
commission on PTSD was a very active one
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
um and that actually Senator berel is a
 
01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
strong supporter of too um I mean hence
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
why she brought up this legislation but
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
I think you know it's this is something
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
we can like easily fix um by removing um
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
the 28a concerns out of it on the
 
01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
amendment um and so I just you know this
 
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
is you know and they and they show
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
strong support for it I I just think
 
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
this is a really good you know a good
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
piece of of of faith for our First
 
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
Responders um which you know it's it's
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
been it's been a like I said it's been a
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
tough year for all of us but it's been
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
an especially tough year for them um so
 
01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
um I just think I I don't think like
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
representative uh Smith said I don't
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
think we have to throw the baby out with
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
the bath water here and you know and I
 
01:21:00.669 --> 01:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
will find and I will wrap up by saying
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
we have been dealt a terrible hand like
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know like but you can't you don't
 
01:21:08.669 --> 01:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
blame the dealer like you just play the
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
hand you're dealt and like you know we
 
01:21:13.149 --> 01:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
are given this these are the these are
 
01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
the this is the hand we're being dealt
 
01:21:17.709 --> 01:21:17.719 align:start position:0%
so I you know we play we play with uh we
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
play with it and we play play our hand
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
and like just hope for the best and we
 
01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
don't you know we don't blame the dealer
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
for it we just we have to do what's best
 
01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.390 align:start position:0%
for it we just we have to do what's best
for

01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
everybody thank you representative uh
 
01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:31.030 align:start position:0%
everybody thank you representative uh
representative

01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
rard thank you um I I just want to
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
respond a little bit to the idea that
 
01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps anybody on this committee
 
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
anybody has uh a negative thought about
 
01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
First Responders we all have family
 
01:21:50.709 --> 01:21:50.719 align:start position:0%
members that are First Responders some
 
01:21:53.629 --> 01:21:53.639 align:start position:0%
of us have lost family members
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
um and the way I looked at this bill was
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
I do believe there are folks that are
 
01:22:06.669 --> 01:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
looking at this as a 28a issue I do
 
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
believe that the three bills here that
 
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
were in one the one that would be the
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
easiest to
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
pass without a whole lot of hoopla
 
01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
without a lot of amendments would be the
 
01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
grand family one and that by doing that
 
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
we have saved the other two bills
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
without a motion to itl it so I I and I
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
do go back to the position that I have
 
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
had that we can have this bill
 
01:22:46.350 --> 01:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
reintroduce and I say we the legislature
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
us me my vote to do it right to do it in
 
01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
labor to get the committee on board in
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
labor to fix it as well as the Land
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
Development Bill get that to our
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
planning and our development to see what
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
they want to do so I I am in support of
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm not I'm not opposed to any
 
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
amendments coming in but that's not
 
01:23:13.950 --> 01:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
what's before us right now what is
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
before us right now is the easiest way
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
to keep all three of these things
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
alive and that is the way I looked at
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
this bill and I would go forward with
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
the um ought to pass as amended thank
 
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:34.920 align:start position:0%

01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%

remove one and two and three that is
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%

the Republican members to vote down
 
01:42:16.589 --> 01:42:16.599 align:start position:0%

01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
the intention of drafting a new
 
01:42:22.589 --> 01:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment and then we'll ask Pam whether
 
01:42:25.390 --> 01:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
that would be possible to to do now if
 
01:42:30.510 --> 01:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
not then we will handle um the amendment
 
01:42:34.270 --> 01:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
uh in principle probably um on Monday
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
for a quick five minute announcement so
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
so representative wall do you want to
 
01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
talk to your caucus yes um thank you Mr
 
01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I I think this is a very
 
01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:48.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable compromise I I think that it
 
01:42:50.350 --> 01:42:50.360 align:start position:0%
accomplishes everything that everybody
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
in the Comm has been talking about and
 
01:42:55.589 --> 01:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
it doesn't hurt anybody and in terms of
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
the training um and the question about
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
maybe 28a or whatever um it's an
 
01:43:03.589 --> 01:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
nonissue and furthermore that could get
 
01:43:05.310 --> 01:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
into micromanaging especially since
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
we're already told a lot of this
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
training has begun so I don't think that
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
hurts I think that this will be a
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
cleaner amendment that we're putting
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
through and I I would ask that we all
 
01:43:17.070 --> 01:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
support the new Amendment and vote out
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended when the time comes
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you with that I will call the role
 
01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
or ask the clerk to call the role on um
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1575
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%

01:43:55.149 --> 01:43:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:58.189 --> 01:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
she appears to have stepped away
 
01:43:58.199 --> 01:44:02.189 align:start position:0%
she appears to have stepped away
okay

01:44:02.189 --> 01:44:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:04.990 --> 01:44:05.000 align:start position:0%

01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%

01:45:15.070 --> 01:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
142 Representative ruard no I think that

this is good would you like to make a
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
further motion to
 
01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:29.229 --> 01:45:29.239 align:start position:0%
142 suggesting perhaps a an
 
01:45:31.870 --> 01:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
additional oh so the amendment what I
 
01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
think we'd like to do and this is we're
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
going to do this right now I guess um
 
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to prepare a an amendment
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
for um Senate Bill
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
142 um keeping in the grand families uh
 
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
commission as well as the commission on
 
01:45:52.589 --> 01:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
on for post-traumatic dress dress
 
01:45:54.910 --> 01:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
disorder for First Responders and
 
01:45:57.629 --> 01:45:57.639 align:start position:0%
removing the portions that have uh any
 
01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
question of 28a by some of the members
 
01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
and we'll bring that forward hopefully
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
if we can get that done today we can
 
01:46:08.830 --> 01:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
take a lunch break and come back if not
 
01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
then we uh would have to do a I guess
 
01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
another meeting next Monday did I do
 
01:46:17.229 --> 01:46:17.239 align:start position:0%
that right sounded right to me does
 
01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
anyone have a comment on
 
01:46:24.430 --> 01:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
the drafting of that potential Amendment
 
01:46:27.709 --> 01:46:27.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative Smith and his dancing
 
01:46:29.709 --> 01:46:29.719 align:start position:0%
hands yeah I got my hand on the correct
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
side this time Mr you look like you're
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
doing jazz hands for us up there so no I
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
would um I would agree I think that that
 
01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh sounds like a pretty good and
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate um plan to go forward um and
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
you know presuming that everything
 
01:46:47.470 --> 01:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
proceeds uh as described and discussed
 
01:46:49.709 --> 01:46:49.719 align:start position:0%
um I I strongly suspect we'll get some
 
01:46:52.189 --> 01:46:52.199 align:start position:0%
good unanimous consensus out of
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative Smith um I
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
would ask rep uh Pam if you're available
 
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
to unmute yourself and have a quick
 
01:47:05.189 --> 01:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
discussion abely I'll even turn my video
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
on hi ah welcome
 
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
um we would like to see if uh your
 
01:47:18.669 --> 01:47:18.679 align:start position:0%
conversations with OS could uh should
 
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
indicate how to proceed you I'm assuming
 
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
you're you're hearing what our amended
 
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
amendment should look like and and is it
 
01:47:33.310 --> 01:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
your or can you find out whether it
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
would be advisable for us to um
 
01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
terminate this executive session with
 
01:47:42.709 --> 01:47:42.719 align:start position:0%
the idea of reestablishing Monday um as
 
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
it is noticed in the calendar
 
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
or um would it be possible to get
 
01:47:51.310 --> 01:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
something like this and back again so
 
01:47:53.950 --> 01:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
that we could wrap this all up
 
01:47:56.709 --> 01:47:56.719 align:start position:0%
today absolutely I've started writing an
 
01:47:59.910 --> 01:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
email that just asks for an expedited
 
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment if possible and and you know
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
if not a time um estimate estimate for
 
01:48:10.030 --> 01:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
um just to be absolutely sure certain
 
01:48:11.470 --> 01:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
that I have it correct you want to
 
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
restore part one to the um bill but only
 
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
section one of part one not section two
 
01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:23.320 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's correct okay
 
01:48:29.229 --> 01:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
yes section two is removed section three
 
01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
remains right so we'll it'll be based on
 
01:48:38.669 --> 01:48:38.679 align:start position:0%
uh 1575 H but restoring uh part one
 
01:48:41.229 --> 01:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
section one and so I'll I'll write to
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
them right now and there you know people
 
01:48:46.589 --> 01:48:46.599 align:start position:0%
are responsive and I'll ask for a a
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
quick answer on what their time frame is
 
01:48:52.270 --> 01:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
yeah um right now it is almost 11
 
01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
o'clock um I wouldn't have any problem
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
coming back uh after lunch but um if
 
01:49:04.350 --> 01:49:04.360 align:start position:0%
that's possible okay I will um get back
 
01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
to you with an answer as soon as I get
 
01:49:10.830 --> 01:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
one thank you all right and I can just
 
01:49:13.149 --> 01:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
email everybody I guess or what's the
 
01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:17.639 align:start position:0%
best way to to um get the word out to
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
everybody um that works works for us I I
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
don't I think
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
probably um yeah an email would be great
 
01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
um and if you could put it on the screen
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
that we're in recess um pending an
 
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
amendment okay Absolutely I'll I'll
 
01:49:41.149 --> 01:49:41.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully be in touch very soon thank
 
01:49:44.990 --> 01:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:49.119 --> 01:49:59.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
U Mr chairman do you need a motion for
 
01:50:06.510 --> 01:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:13.390 --> 01:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
that I just don't want to hold you up if
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:23.709 align:start position:0%
 
motion

01:50:23.709 --> 01:50:23.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
the Senate actually goes takes a roll
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
call to go into recess I um I think I
 
01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:35.199 --> 01:50:37.589 align:start position:0%
 
until

01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
until
 
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
H well we don't really know um I'm GNA
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
say it's at least going to be one
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
o'clock okay so um one o' we will be
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
back and and unless you get an email
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
prior to that from us then um it may be
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
that uh the one o00 has changed to
 
01:51:01.470 --> 01:51:01.480 align:start position:0%
Monday morning um or Monday afternoon
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
but it it will be I promise a a five
 
01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
minute um vote because we're simply
 
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
voting on what we've in principle all
 
01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
agreed to anyway so um I think I think
 
01:51:16.629 --> 01:51:16.639 align:start position:0%
that's how it's going to work we'll try
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
one o'clock if it's impossible for OLS
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
to have give us
 
01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment we need by then then we'll
 
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:25.560 align:start position:0%

01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
see thumbs
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:48.960 --> 03:56:52.830 align:start position:0%
 
much

03:56:52.830 --> 03:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:52.840 --> 03:56:55.750 align:start position:0%

03:57:20.319 --> 03:57:21.990 align:start position:0%

reasonable

03:57:21.990 --> 03:57:22.000 align:start position:0%

03:58:49.670 --> 03:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:54.389 --> 03:58:54.399 align:start position:0%

everyone who work on adding this part
 
03:59:12.710 --> 03:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
back um it really goes a long way and it
 
03:59:14.830 --> 03:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
shows that we can all work together for
 
03:59:17.269 --> 03:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
the betterment of of everybody so I just
 
03:59:20.790 --> 03:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:23.590 --> 03:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
that um we can work for the betterment
 
03:59:27.110 --> 03:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
of everyone and and I hope um I'll say
 
03:59:28.790 --> 03:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
this again but I think it should go
 
03:59:28.800 --> 03:59:30.469 align:start position:0%
this again but I think it should go
without

03:59:30.469 --> 03:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
without
 
03:59:34.469 --> 03:59:34.479 align:start position:0%
saying um the prior Amendment wasn't
 
03:59:39.189 --> 03:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
meant in any way to slight any group
 
03:59:41.149 --> 03:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
um it was different
 
03:59:43.510 --> 03:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
approaches and it was speaking more to
 
03:59:46.110 --> 03:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
the legislation and the methodology
 
03:59:50.990 --> 03:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
rather than any individual group um it
 
03:59:54.189 --> 03:59:54.199 align:start position:0%
would have been the same approach taken
 
03:59:56.229 --> 03:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
if it was a study committee on
 
03:59:59.750 --> 03:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
beekeepers I mean anything quite frankly
 
04:00:04.070 --> 04:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
so um with that if I see no other
 
04:00:07.510 --> 04:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
comments questions um are we ready for
 
04:00:10.670 --> 04:00:10.680 align:start position:0%

04:05:07.110 --> 04:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
who made the motion and who seconded it
 
04:05:09.630 --> 04:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
for the to passes amended I I missed
 
04:05:09.640 --> 04:05:11.830 align:start position:0%
for the to passes amended I I missed
that

04:05:11.830 --> 04:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:16.110 --> 04:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
somehow forg pass I think I don't think
 
04:05:19.630 --> 04:05:19.640 align:start position:0%
we did that um that's how I missed
 
04:05:22.670 --> 04:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
it I think it was fine I think we just I
 
04:05:25.429 --> 04:05:25.439 align:start position:0%
just accepted um so I would say
 
04:05:27.870 --> 04:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
representative green made the motion of
 
04:05:30.070 --> 04:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended and
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative wall seconded it that's
 
04:05:36.870 --> 04:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:39.910 --> 04:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
yeah it was just so
 
04:05:44.030 --> 04:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
fast um so that means that we have two
 
04:05:46.830 --> 04:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
committee reports that have to be done
 
04:05:50.030 --> 04:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
