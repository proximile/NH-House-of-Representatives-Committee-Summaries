00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone I suppose I should
 
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
announce since we're apparently on the
 
00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
air that the subcommittee for House Bill
 
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
609 will commence as soon as our last
 
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
remaining member arrives so stand by
 
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:58.830 align:start position:0%
remaining member arrives so stand by
thank

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:58.840 --> 00:08:00.790 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
okay it's uh 10 10 and we have waited as
 
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
long as I think it's reasonable to wait
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
for the other member of the subcommittee
 
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to convene the subcommittee
 
00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:15.879 align:start position:0%
meeting on House Bill
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
69 and as is customary I'm going to ask
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%

all okay thank you very much the members
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
of this subcommittee are to my left
 
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
representative Tom Corman and
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative cat McGee and to my right
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
representative Michael Harrington and
 
00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:53.959 align:start position:0%
the missing member currently is
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
representative Tony Kaplan who may or
 
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
may not arrive at any moment
 
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
what we're here to do today is
 
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
to decide what to do about House Bill
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
609 as many of you will recall House
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 281 which was passed earlier this
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
session and eventually signed by the
 
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.750 align:start position:0%
session and eventually signed by the
governor

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
implemented much or some I should say of
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
the legislative language of HB
 
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
609 our legislative researcher Christy
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
off fesser has produced a side by side
 
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.550 align:start position:0%
off fesser has produced a side by side
on

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
hb281 which shows clearly what parts of
 
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
HB 609 are already in law in statute and
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
from that we can deduce what parts of HB
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
609 did not make it into statute now I
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
could go through this lengthy side by
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
side but I don't think that would
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily be productive I know all
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh received a
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
copy of this side by side is that true
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
Christie I believe it
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
please I didn't get okay so I'm wrong on
 
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
that not everybody has received one
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
could you send a copy of the side by
 
00:10:31.949 --> 00:10:31.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
would anybody like a printed copy
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
printed copy yeah great looks like we
 
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
need some printed copies too so thank
 
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
you I have a copy here and uh I
 
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
can go through it if anybody thinks it
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
it would be worthwhile it's a it's a
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
lengthy side by side it's
 
00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
um how many pages 21 Pages 23 pages and
 
00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
essentially what it what happened with
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
hb281 is that the provisions of HB 609
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
that transferred enforcement to the
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
Department of energy from the
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
SEC all that was adopted in
 
00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
hb281 and some other language was
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
adopted that clarified for example the
 
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
role of individual departments in the
 
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.389 align:start position:0%
role of individual departments in the
permitting

00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
process other parts of HB 609 were not
 
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
adopted in that
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment so there are other citing
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
reforms that likely could be
 
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:37.160 align:start position:0%
made and that's part of what we're here
 
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
today I do have a proposal that has been
 
00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
submitted on another possible reform
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
which I want to discuss today but before
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
we do that I would like to open it up to
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
the individual members of the committee
 
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
to indicate what interest they have in
 
00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
making changes to HB 609 and what
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
changes they would favor does anybody
 
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
have a uh would like to start
 
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr chair
 
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
um my question would be I I didn't have
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
the benefit of being part of the
 
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that met on site evaluation
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
and I would like to revisit what we're
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve by the changes that
 
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
we're making rather than just making the
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
changes if we could identify the goals
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
the changes because I I know there is an
 
00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
understanding that we don't want the
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
process to be overly long or overly
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
burdensome but if we could maybe just
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
Define the things we're trying to
 
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
achieve then it will help us uh assess
 
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
the suggestions that come through as to
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
whether they respond to
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
that I was counting on you to ask that
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
question I knew you would I appreciate
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
that I think the
 
00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
goal for reforming the site evaluation
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
committee right from the beginning if
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
you look back at the two subcommittee
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
reports um or committee reports study
 
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
committee reports I should say that were
 
00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:11.959 align:start position:0%
produced the goal was to make the
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
process less cumbersome less lengthy and
 
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.030 align:start position:0%
process less cumbersome less lengthy and
less

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
costly and some of what we achieved with
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
house house bill 281 I think moves Us in
 
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
that direction but there are other
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
possibilities that we could look into to
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
see if we could move those goals
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
forward then follow up follow up um and
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
then the thought that I had is there was
 
00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
a lengthy conversation at the recent
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
energy Summit uh there was a panel
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
discussion on the site evaluation
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
committee process and the attorney on
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
that panel had said that she was going
 
00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
to be controversial by saying that she
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
did not think that the length of the
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
process was
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily um unto you know or too long
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
how how do we know when a process is too
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
long I mean it's in the eye of the
 
00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
beholder isn't it I'm just not sure how
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
we speed it up we just say don't do an
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
analysis or you know well I don't think
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
the length of the process is the only
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
issue I think the complexity of the
 
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
process is also an issue and the
 
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
and by complexity of the process I mean
 
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
all the different moving parts that go
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
into an SEC formal process when we had
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
our study committees on on the SEC we
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
actually produced a um a flowchart that
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
showed all the different steps that had
 
00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:50.839 align:start position:0%
to happen to get to a point where the
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
SEC could make a determination about the
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
viability of a site certificate
 
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
application and it is quite burdensome
 
00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:05.079 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of steps a lot of hearings
 
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of public meetings Etc and the
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
question then
 
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
becomes is it overly burdensome at this
 
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
point and is are there ways to
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
streamline the
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
process now you mentioned time 365 days
 
00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
is the statutory time limit yeah you
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
could change the statutory time limit
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
you could change it to 200 7 days or 180
 
00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
days that would deal maybe with some of
 
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
the issues but maybe not all of the
 
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.990 align:start position:0%
the issues but maybe not all of the
issues

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
so uh that would be how I would react to
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
that to that question do you have
 
00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
another followup or should I let
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
representive fairing I do and and it's
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh just another thought about what
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
contributes to the efficiency of moving
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
through the process which would be
 
00:15:56.309 --> 00:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
expertise and I think that's one other
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
aspect that we haven't addressed yet is
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not there is sufficient
 
00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:05.959 align:start position:0%
expertise on sighting within the
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
department of energy Andor the Pu the Pu
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
has a lot less resources now a lot less
 
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
staff um and they have somebody I think
 
00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:16.839 align:start position:0%
dedicated to citing but I'm not sure how
 
00:16:16.839 --> 00:16:17.910 align:start position:0%
dedicated to citing but I'm not sure how
much

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
information um should just um I'm not
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
sure how much expertise resides uh
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
within the grouping of people who would
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
be responsible for SEC now so that's the
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
other thought representative
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you Mr chairman as I've
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
said before I think I'm the only one
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
here who's actually served on site
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation committees and I've served on
 
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
a bunch of them um the problem with the
 
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
time factor which I think has somewhat
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
been addressed by hb281 with the changes
 
00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
was simply a scheduling issue uh I'm I'm
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
not exaggerating when I'd say we'd get
 
00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
with Mike a capino who was the uh
 
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
Council for the site evaluation
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
committee and the members of the
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
committee would sit in a room for half
 
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
half an hour trying to figure out when
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
we could schedule the next meeting and
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
it was a constant barrage oh how about
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh July 28th oh no I'm on vacation uh
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
August 2nd no I'm in a conference uh no
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
I can't make that I can't make that so
 
00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
we had statutory time frames and when we
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
were supposed to act and they were
 
00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
almost always had to be waved because we
 
00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:20.039 align:start position:0%
couldn't just get the the group together
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh there was also and I'll be quite
 
00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
honest about this was also some people
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
that were on the committee that had no
 
00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
idea why they were there and didn't want
 
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
to be because maybe they were from the
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire library branch or
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
something like that or even someone from
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
the state parks that they're going what
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
do I have to do with wind farms and that
 
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
just made it more complicated because it
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
was then a lot of the instead of having
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners on there a lot of was
 
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
deferred to lower level people who kind
 
00:17:47.549 --> 00:17:47.559 align:start position:0%
of looked at it as almost like a
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
punishment for being there because well
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
I could get relieved of any of my other
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
work and I've just got assign to this
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
stupid committee that I don't know why
 
00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
I'm on it anyways so being blatantly
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
honest I think uh 2 a one addressed a
 
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
lot of those things um because we've cut
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
down the size of the committee
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
substantially which is going to make
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
scheduling a lot easier having it go to
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy is going to
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
give a dedicated group of people with
 
00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:12.919 align:start position:0%
some resources there which we didn't
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
have when there was a site evaluation
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
committee there was just these people
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
from all different departments but
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
really no one was assigned to the
 
00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole and I also think a
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
step that was made in the wrong
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
direction which we can fix is putting
 
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
public members on the side of valuation
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
committee we don't use that for anything
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
else if you want to get an air discharge
 
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
permit from Dees there's no board that
 
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
has public members on it if you want to
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
get a wastewater treatment uh permit
 
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
there's no board that has that on there
 
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know of any uh permit
 
00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:46.039 align:start position:0%
that's issued by the state of New
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh with the Department of
 
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation Dees whatever that says
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to have a board here
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have public members
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
on it who are voting members obviously
 
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
the public has a opportunity to come in
 
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
and testify and present the Attorney
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
General's office present uh appoints a
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
public counsel who is there to represent
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
the council so if even if someone can't
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
show up individually they can certainly
 
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
um uh uh send information to the
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
attorney general if a group of people
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
from a particular town or area want to
 
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
file his intervenor status they can do
 
00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:22.039 align:start position:0%
that and they be represented they'll be
 
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
able to speak in front of the commission
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
and present uh Witnesses and evidence as
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact there's even a
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
provision in the which I think is still
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
there that they can get money from the
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
applicant so if you're applying for a
 
00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
wind farm for example and the people in
 
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
the area where it's proposed to be built
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
want to bring in a consultant on wind
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
noise they can actually petition the
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee and get the
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
wind farm applicant to pay them $10,000
 
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
so they can hire an outside consultant
 
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
thinking that they wouldn't have any
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
resources so I think the public is very
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
well covered and adding a public member
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
to the board or to the commission just
 
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
bogs things down and I don't know why we
 
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
make an exception for this is the only
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
one that I'm aware of so I would like to
 
00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
see that out the finally um we've made a
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
lot of changes already um there's a as
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
you know there's another proposed bill I
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
have there just a cleanup of rules which
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
is sort of outside of this because the
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
when the committee passed rules they
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
went way beyond their legislative
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
Authority back a few years ago but I'm
 
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
not sure how much we want to change this
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
until we actually see it in use a little
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
bit and then maybe come back and a year
 
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
or two and say okay under the new
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
Provisions we it's working better but
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
here's a few changes we need to make
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
we're trying to fix a system that we've
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
never used hardly so that's something to
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
be aware
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
of so did I just understand you to say
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
that you're not in favor of making any
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
further changes to the um site
 
00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:51.559 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee unless someone
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
could bring up a compelling reason to do
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
it right now I'm I just looked at the
 
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
website and I don't think
 
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think they've had any major
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
changes since that bill went into effect
 
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
282 or 281 so I mean major hearings so
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
maybe someone can correct me but I don't
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
think it's been it's been tried on a
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
full-blown hearing there's been a lot of
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm looking at these declaratory
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
ruling uh Renewables uh CRA capacity
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
Bank project Clos Chariot solar project
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
investigation of complaints regarding
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
inam wind uh chanuk solar inam wind
 
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
energy closed closed closed closed close
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
close close close um I'm just wondering
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
if we I don't think we've actually
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
started with a here's a new major
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
project and we're going to have a site
 
00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
evaluation commiss committee for it and
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to go through the process and
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
see how it works so you know we don't we
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
we can keep tweaking forever but
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line we've got to
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
try what we've got out there and uh
 
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll have to come back and make
 
00:21:53.269 --> 00:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
some additional changes maybe it works
 
00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
pretty good but we won't know until we
 
00:21:54.679 --> 00:21:56.149 align:start position:0%
pretty good but we won't know until we
try

00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
try
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
it so your comments kind of open the
 
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
door for a discussion on
 
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
a proposal that I received from Tom
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
getts who attended every single one of
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
the study committee meetings on the SEC
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
as a former pu and SEC commissioner with
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh tenure I think he was a puc
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner for 20
 
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:20.360 align:start position:0%
years and but a long
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
time he is proposing that the site
 
00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.950 align:start position:0%
time he is proposing that the site
evaluation

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
committee be CH the membership be
 
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
changed to the following the
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
commissioners of the Public Utilities
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
Commission all three of them the
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
envirment of Environmental Services and
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
the fifth member would be the
 
00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
00:22:48.029 --> 00:22:48.039 align:start position:0%
energy this would be a a substantial
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
change to the makeup of the site
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee and is an
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
interesting idea that I think we should
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
discuss alternatively He suggests that A
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
P public member could
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
be um a member instead of the
 
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of energy
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
and I would like to hear from the
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
Department of energy if we
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
on what role the department could play
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
as a member of the SEC or if there might
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
be some conflict with other things that
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
the department does is uh that would
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
sort of preclude them from being a
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
member of the SEC so commissioner Elms
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
and Mr shulock welcome and uh look
 
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
forward to seeing what you think about
 
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.190 align:start position:0%
forward to seeing what you think about
all

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
this thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
members of the subcommittee uh for the
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
record Deputy Commissioner Chris Elms
 
00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
and general counsel David shulock of the
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
Department of energy um you know and
 
00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the uh proposal we have
 
00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
had some some brief conversations on it
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
but we haven't distilled the whole thing
 
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
so I I can't speak to the whole uh the
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
whole thing um just to start off uh
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
before diving into that question um as
 
00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
as referenced you know the department
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
has not had a role in the sighting
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
process prior to the passage of House
 
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 281 House Bill 281 still has not
 
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
gone into effect it will be effective
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
October 7th um just given the you know
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
the effective date after the uh signing
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
of the bill uh and we're looking forward
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
to that transition so that new
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
complaints that come in following
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
October 7th will be handled by the
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
department of Energy's enforcement
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
division um that change re at least as
 
00:24:37.389 --> 00:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
far as the department is concerned 281
 
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
mostly addressed the monitoring and
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement um side of citing uh it it
 
00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
did not have major changes to the
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
composition of the SEC for the actual
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
evaluation of uh projects that came
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
forward um and you know obviously that's
 
00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
something that this subcommittee is
 
00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
looking at um and the question of
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
whether or not we make some reform to
 
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
the SEC or whether we move it to the Pu
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
obviously is one for for this committee
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
to decide um some issues that I just
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to touch on prior to doing this
 
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
and and I think Drew Beamer who's here
 
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
uh can probably speak to this a little
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
bit better than I can uh one of the
 
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
major issues um that they're that they
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
face uh is not necessarily the length of
 
00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
time with which uh it takes to evaluate
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
these projects but the um the churn you
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
know the the uh changing of designes of
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
public members the lack of continuity
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
and institutional knowledge that
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
develops which can make it really
 
00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to have consistency
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
and Clarity in the process I think
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
that's something that we've prioritized
 
00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:45.559 align:start position:0%
and we we did talk about that in the
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
state energy strategy that having a
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
predictable process not a predictable
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
result but but but something where you
 
00:25:55.389 --> 00:25:55.399 align:start position:0%
know if I follow this process I I can
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
expect you know um you know this Lev of
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
scrutiny in this result is important
 
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
having that be clear and consistent and
 
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
that's why we've taken the view that the
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
most important skill set that can be you
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
know had by these adjudicators uh
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
regardless of if it's the committee or
 
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
if it's the um pu or whatever it is that
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
they have that professional adjudicative
 
00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
uh ability uh that's something that's
 
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
going to be important you know you're
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
not going to find somebody who's an
 
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
expert in all Realms of that could
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
possibly enter into exciting process but
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
having professional adjudicators with a
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
clear and consistent process makes it so
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
that the results are something that we
 
00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
can you know find in the public interest
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so to answer your
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
questions about the actual proposal in
 
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
front of us um you know if if that's the
 
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
way the the direction the committee
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
wants to go to revamp the SEC rather
 
00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:50.919 align:start position:0%
than transfer that process over to the
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
Pu we're definitely happy to to be a
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
part of it and look at it I would say
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
that the department Department of energy
 
00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner or design might not be the
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
most appropriate uh representative on
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
that committee we do have that role of
 
00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:06.919 align:start position:0%
enforcement and I think that that's
 
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
important to have that separated right
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
we have a certificate that comes out and
 
00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
it's our job to enforce that certificate
 
00:27:15.789 --> 00:27:15.799 align:start position:0%
uh the department of energy might also
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
want to play a role in intervening in a
 
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
project right we might want to be able
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
to come in Advocate on behalf of a
 
00:27:23.789 --> 00:27:23.799 align:start position:0%
project because we think it will help us
 
00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
meet our reliability needs or some other
 
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
public policy goal that that is within
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
the charge of the department and it
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
would remove the awkwardness of having
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
the commissioner or the commissioner's
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
designate judging the project that we
 
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
might have a a stake in wanting to do
 
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
that now obviously other folks can have
 
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
those opinions but just it might be a
 
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
more clear uh overlap between the
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
department than it would be a different
 
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
state agency um that's obviously up to
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh this subcommittee and the committee
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
to to determine but we'd be happy to
 
00:27:59.789 --> 00:27:59.799 align:start position:0%
talk to you about about that further um
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
looking through some of the the the
 
00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
proposal and David I don't know I'll let
 
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
you go after me but um there were some
 
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
changes here that I think we'd want to
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
talk about um I I think Drew can speak a
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more to the sec's needs um
 
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:19.240 align:start position:0%
and staffing needs and uh sorry somebody
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
from the Pu was going to be here but
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
they got held up um I I think it would
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
be important to speak with them to make
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
sure that they have what it takes to
 
00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
implement a proposal like this
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
especially if we are you know removing
 
00:28:36.909 --> 00:28:36.919 align:start position:0%
some of uh some of the tools like
 
00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that are used to maybe
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
divide up work a little bit uh there
 
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
might be a staffing need that just needs
 
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
to be looked at or addressed one thing I
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
I would recommend to this committee
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
regardless of which direction you want
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
to go um you know and I I somebody had
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
made a reference to the Pu only having
 
00:28:57.509 --> 00:28:57.519 align:start position:0%
the SEC administrator right now the Pu
 
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the SEC administrator so
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
Drew especially once uh 281 goes into
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
effect in a couple of days um is one
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
employee of that agency but he can't
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
work with the Pu or the department of
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
energy as as a member of of you know one
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
of those agencies uh it would be perhaps
 
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
beneficial to clarify that
 
00:29:22.509 --> 00:29:22.519 align:start position:0%
Drew worked you know he could be an
 
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
employee from of the Pu who was
 
00:29:27.149 --> 00:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
designated by the commissioner to serve
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
as SEC administrator but when there are
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
times where there aren't um active you
 
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.789 align:start position:0%
times where there aren't um active you
know

00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
um uh projects coming in or or or or
 
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be that he is freed up
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to do work with the Pu and
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
that can help address some of the
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
Staffing challenges that we talked about
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
right he's he he has skill sets and and
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
future administr administrators will
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
have skill sets that would be helpful to
 
00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
the Pu and I think it would be efficient
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
for the state to be able to use those
 
00:29:59.509 --> 00:29:59.519 align:start position:0%
resources uh to their fullest
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
capabilities so that would be one thing
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
I would recommend regardless of the
 
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
direction we end up going I've been
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
talking a long time I'll let uh David
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
add anything if there's anything to add
 
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
it representative Harrington would like
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
to ask a question yeah I just kind of
 
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
going back to one I think one of your
 
00:30:20.669 --> 00:30:20.679 align:start position:0%
main points was the idea of separating
 
00:30:24.029 --> 00:30:24.039 align:start position:0%
the um people that may be taking a
 
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
position one way or the other on a
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
project which we want the department of
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
energy obviously be doing and from those
 
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
making the decision on whether he should
 
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:33.799 align:start position:0%
get a permit or not um it seems to me is
 
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
that's a logical followup to what we did
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
with the reorganization from the Pu to
 
00:30:39.149 --> 00:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
the doe because one of the major
 
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
complaints we had in the past was that
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
you had pu employees who worked for the
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioners making recommendations to
 
00:30:48.909 --> 00:30:48.919 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners on whether or not
 
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
something should be done and they sort
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
of thought that was somewhat of a
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest and now we've split
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
that off on utility matters so the doe
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
is making those Rec recommendations and
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners are making the
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
decision so of going along with that
 
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
thing I I would have to agree with you
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't want the department we
 
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
want the department of energy to
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
advocate for the State of New Hampshire
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
uh as a um interested party in this but
 
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
they we don't want them also then try to
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
make a decision on it because it seems
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
to me is that's just going to get you in
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
trouble H having that so thank you and I
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
and I do think that we are better
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
positioned to fulfill that interested
 
00:31:27.789 --> 00:31:27.799 align:start position:0%
party role than the adjudicative role
 
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
um if you had to choose between the
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
department being either an interested
 
00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:35.799 align:start position:0%
party or on the the committee um I think
 
00:31:38.909 --> 00:31:38.919 align:start position:0%
we'd be better uh situated to serve in
 
00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:41.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
perspective my perspective Remains the
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
Same which is that I believe that this
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
is a matter that should be left to
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
professional adjudicators
 
00:32:01.149 --> 00:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
such as the three members of the Pu with
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
adequate U expert help and I believe uh
 
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
we've previously proposed two to three
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
positions including an attorney um uh
 
00:32:14.669 --> 00:32:14.679 align:start position:0%
someone with land use planning uh
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
experience and maybe somebody with
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
environmental uh experience right
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
um that would make for the most
 
00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.509 align:start position:0%
um that would make for the most
efficient

00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
process what would you think of the idea
 
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:31.480 align:start position:0%
of making the fifth member
 
00:32:35.149 --> 00:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
a member from the justice department
 
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
that's someone with a judicative
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
experience uh well the justice
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
department is charged with representing
 
00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039 align:start position:0%
the the public already now they they are
 
00:32:48.039 --> 00:32:49.149 align:start position:0%
the the public already now they they are
accustomed

00:32:49.149 --> 00:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
accustomed
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
to placing Walls Within their
 
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
organization so they might be able to
 
00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:54.919 align:start position:0%
make that
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
work but I I would actually leave that
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
for the Department to to aine
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
on well I know it takes us down the road
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
that representative Harrington described
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
eloquently about making it difficult to
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
schedule meetings but we could also
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
potentially put in someone like the
 
00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:16.519 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh instead of the
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
Department of energy any any comment on
 
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.669 align:start position:0%
Department of energy any any comment on
that

00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
idea uh will at risk of speaking for my
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh fellow state agencies I I I don't
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
want to take a position on on Dot's
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
applicability other than we we think
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
they would probably have more um
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
experience with the the types of
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
Permitting that happens uh in a sighting
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
process okay representative Corman has a
 
00:33:44.669 --> 00:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
chairman excuse me um I was looking over
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
the notes I took during testimony for HB
 
00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
609 uh months ago and a few things
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
struck me uh one was that
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
there was a comment that the issue with
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
scheduling meetings wasn't so much the
 
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
members of the public but the uh the
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
people from the various departments not
 
00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
being available so um I think there's
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
something to be said for having fewer
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
departments on the site evaluation
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
committee but I'm not sure there's
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
something to be said for removing
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
members of the public from the site
 
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee and I understand
 
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
the point that the public would still
 
00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
certainly be able to act as interveners
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
but there's a difference between being
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
an intervenor and being somebody who's
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
actually on the committee with a vote
 
00:34:39.149 --> 00:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
and making a decision so I would
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
certainly advocate for at least one
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
public member on the site evaluation
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
committee I also wonder about having the
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
Pu involved and I understand that it has
 
00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:57.640 align:start position:0%
been involved in in some states the Pu
 
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
is the site evaluation committee but I
 
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
have a couple of concerns one is that we
 
00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:07.079 align:start position:0%
keep hearing how the Pu is
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
backlogged and you know certainly when I
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
look at the list of dockets I see a lot
 
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
of dockets there and many of them not to
 
00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:17.720 align:start position:0%
be decided for quite a while and now
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is giving them
 
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
even uh a a larger role a greater
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
percentage of the role in the site
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
and then there's also a question that I
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
recall being raised during
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
testimony uh by um the Sierra Club and
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
that was that the Public Utilities
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
Commission is really concerned um with
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
with keeping costs of power down and of
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
course that's something that we all want
 
00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
but sometimes that could be at odds with
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
choosing a site so there I think there's
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
some question as to whether the Pu
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
should be involved or the degree to
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
which the Pu should be
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
involved um one other thing I want to
 
00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:05.720 align:start position:0%
mention is again during testimony it was
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
brought out that there are other
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
agencies that uh do have a hand in these
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
things sometimes so uh I believe fish
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
and game because of uh some some
 
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
endangered species issues
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure I really like the idea
 
00:36:25.309 --> 00:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
of not having a member of the public and
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
having the Pu be
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
committee if I may comment and and and
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that I I would push the
 
00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
scheduling question related to public
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
members to uh Drew Beamer who's the
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
administrator for the SEC and he could
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
speak to that certainly better than than
 
00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
we could um as far as a backlog is
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
concerned at the Pu and and uh I think
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
they would be better situated to address
 
00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
this but I think early on and even prior
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
to the transition uh that was a a more
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
significant um hurdle uh today I don't
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
think uh the backlog is a is a
 
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
significant issue with what's what's uh
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
there uh for the Pu um to the point
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
about you know their mission right as
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
David alluded to right the Pu are
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
professional adjudicators and what they
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
are are charged with is adjudicating
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
those statutory uh considerations that
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature have have passed and put
 
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
into effect so you know they if we look
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
at at you know there's a structure
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
question and a policy question right
 
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
what is the best way to efficiently
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
execute the statute what what we've uh
 
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
you know argued in favor of is the puc
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
being that body um it really is up to
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature to determine what are
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
the criteria folks are looking at how
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
are they going to be you know uh
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
addressing these those those are
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements that that can be
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
looked at by the legislature while not
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
um trying to solve that problem by
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
changing the composition of the
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
commission or the committee in some way
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
so that would be just my my thought on
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
you so Mr shulock I have a question for
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
you the proposal that we received from
 
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.550 align:start position:0%
you the proposal that we received from
Mr

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
getts also makes a significant change in
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
then in that rather than having the full
 
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
SEC evaluate applications for a
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
certificate the chairperson of the SEC
 
00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
would under Section H col 7 application
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
for certificate the chairperson would
 
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
become the person who reviews the
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
application and determines its
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
suitability to move
 
00:38:47.069 --> 00:38:47.079 align:start position:0%
forward is that a
 
00:38:50.589 --> 00:38:50.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable approach or uh is that
 
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
fraught with problems I think it's a
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable and efficient
 
00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
approach okay thank
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
you now I have some questions if I could
 
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank the two of you for for sitting
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
in I have some questions for Mr Beamer
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you with regard
 
00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
to oh I'm sorry hang on representative
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
Herring has Harrington has a couple of
 
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
followers you thought you get in a way
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
easy here huh um I wanted to follow up
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
on a couple of things that was stated
 
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
there that you talked about um Mr sh
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
about uh having a different uh position
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
for um to bring in expertise in in
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
sighting and land use and so forth and
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
so forth well we already have those
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
experts I would Envision the way this
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
would work is that the dees would be
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
like the coordinator for the state's
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
involvement in the permit outside of the
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
actual commission committee itself so if
 
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
uh if there was something involved
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
fishing games Dees would coordinate with
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
fishing game there's almost 100% sure
 
00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be something
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
involved with uh uh Dees uh I mean
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services so
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
they would they would coordinate those
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
and whatever permits were required and
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
they would work with them uh this it
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
could be something from the Department
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
of Transportation so rather than have uh
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
the people with these individual
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
expertise be assigned to the site
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee I think it would be
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
more workable if we use the expertise we
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
already have in the existing agencies
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
and coordinate them through the
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
department of energy so if there was a
 
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
concern from fishing game let's say it
 
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
was mentioned on endangered species that
 
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
they would contact Dees and then Dees
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
may bring them in as a witness to
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
Something in the tri in the here the
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
process or if there was something to do
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
with roads had to be modified or
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
something they get someone from doe do I
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
just don't think it's necessary to bring
 
00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
in more people if we could coordinate
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
have I think you'd be asking an awful
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
lot of the puc right
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
um to to make sure that all of that work
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
has been done right and there are always
 
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
going to be gaps because Dees and your
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
perating agencies are only going to be
 
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
looking at permitting criteria which
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
don't always cover citing criteria
 
00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
number of handicap parking spaces
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to have an whether
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
something that Dees would permit right
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
would have an un effect on the local
 
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
economy right that's a separate
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
consideration and the Pu might need some
 
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
expertise in looking at those land use
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
issues and land valuation
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
issues economic issu it may be better to
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
hire specifically for a particular
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
project then with a consultant rather
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
than bring on full-time staff and um so
 
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
the uh I think the last proposal had
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for both okay yeah and and
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
one other thing i' just like to mention
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
um I never heard Once In Site evaluation
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
committee processes that I was involved
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
in where anybody from the p UC brought
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
up the fact that we shouldn't be looking
 
00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
at this project because it may affect
 
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
electric rates one way or the other that
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
was basically considered that's a
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
separate issue that's electric rates are
 
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
a separate issue has really got nothing
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
to do with this so I I just want to make
 
00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
sure that that did not become an issue
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
where people said well we shouldn't
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
build this type of plant because uh it's
 
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
going to have some effect on electric
 
00:42:19.309 --> 00:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
rates it was always what are the rules
 
00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
with the for the site evaluation
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
committee do they conform to the rules
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
are there any modifications we have to
 
00:42:26.349 --> 00:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
make in it but never did cost of the
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
issue you know uh existing
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
SEC legislation and
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
rules have attempted to set up a process
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
similar to the planning board process at
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
the local level so you enact rules and
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
ordinances in your town and then the
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
planning board makes decisions about
 
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
individual site applications based on
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
those rules and regulations and if a
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
developer complies with every Rule and
 
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
regulation then you really cannot say no
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
to a
 
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
development and the site evaluation
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
process could benefit from being run
 
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
similarly I think to that planning board
 
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
process you put into statute and to
 
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
rules those principles that you think
 
00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.430 align:start position:0%
rules those principles that you think
are

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
critical and then
 
00:43:29.309 --> 00:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
evaluate applications based on their
 
00:43:33.309 --> 00:43:33.319 align:start position:0%
success in following those critical
 
00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:37.880 align:start position:0%
rules uh so I if whatever process we set
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
up can get us closer to that
 
00:43:46.109 --> 00:43:46.119 align:start position:0%
uh that reality or that aspiration then
 
00:43:48.549 --> 00:43:48.559 align:start position:0%
I think that's a way we can go
 
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
representative uh McGee had a question I
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
think thank you Mr chairman yeah I was
 
00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
just uh looking at the recommendations
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
here that we have before us and under
 
00:43:59.309 --> 00:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
item five it says the senior serving
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
attorney member of the Public Utilities
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
Commission s Shall Serve as the
 
00:44:04.549 --> 00:44:04.559 align:start position:0%
chairperson and chief executive of the
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
committee and May and it goes on so um
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
not all the members of the Pu currently
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
are attorneys right so would that be
 
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
Colton Simpson or or would that be this
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
is the serving senior attorney of the Pu
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
serving attorney member turn on your mic
 
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
please there's always an attorney
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
there's always there has to be one at
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
least by law
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
right so so it's defining who in the Pu
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
would be sort of the chief adjudicator
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
right the chairperson attorney okay
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
correct it would it would have to be an
 
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
attorney basically is what it says
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
okay okay I have I have another question
 
00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
for you guys if I could um I brought up
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
earlier the fact that at the New
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire energy Summit this year there
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
was a panel on sighting and um everyone
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
on that panel had some experience
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
with uh with citing in New Hampshire and
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
the issue um and each of the members
 
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:03.640 align:start position:0%
were asked if there was one change you
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
could make what would it be and um uh
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
Mark sanbor said properly fund the SEC
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
and I think he was
 
00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
um looking at the fact that without
 
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
adequate staff in some cases or perhaps
 
00:45:23.309 --> 00:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
expertise associated with the group that
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
um like the land use expertise I think
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
is where
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh I would be concerned if the
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
adjudicative body didn't have that
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
experience on the board because I serve
 
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
on a zoning board and I know that the
 
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
town planner attends those meetings and
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
he often will insert information that no
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
matter how knowledgeable you are um they
 
00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
have a different level of understanding
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering if that piece might be
 
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
missing in terms of a statutorily
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
assigned person so that we know that
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
that expertise would exist but on the
 
00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
funding side it sounded like what he was
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
saying is that without without staff
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
dedicated to that process when we do
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
project we may not
 
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh we may not be able to move fast
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
because we don't have somebody who's
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
really a professional in that area so
 
00:46:14.549 --> 00:46:14.559 align:start position:0%
could you comment on that sure and and I
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
think my suggestion earlier of having
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
the administrator of the SEC be a member
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
of the Pu staff is a two-way street so
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
he can he can give his services to the
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
Pu when there aren't a lot of sighting
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
issues it also allows him to draw on the
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
resources of the Pu more effectively and
 
00:46:35.309 --> 00:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
efficiently when there are times where
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
there is a greater workload um that that
 
00:46:40.109 --> 00:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
would be of benefit um but having a
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
well-resourced sighting uh operation is
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
going to be important if we're going
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
to make improvements anywhere we can
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
make whatever structural changes we have
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
but if we don't have the resources to
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
actually execute that um it it's it's
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
all so this may seem a little in the
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
weeds but I'm not sure I really
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
understand since we've you know re
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
reorganized the Pu the regulatory piece
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
versus the agency piece um how many
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
staff remain with the Pu and what
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
they're devoted to and then what
 
00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:13.559 align:start position:0%
resources exist in the doe to support
 
00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
the Pu or the SEC at the time that
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
there's a sighting project so I think
 
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that better would be
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
helpful yeah uh the the department has
 
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
about 75 uh employees it's it's been
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
very variable especially with Federal
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
funding that's come in and we've had um
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
a number of full-time temporary
 
00:47:33.069 --> 00:47:33.079 align:start position:0%
positions that have been created uh the
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
commission I think is around 20
 
00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:38.599 align:start position:0%
employees uh the SEC has one and the
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
office of the consumer Advocate has uh
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
six positions now uh with the passage of
 
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
a uh the state budget so um that's about
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
the breakdown um obviously we have a a
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
varied role at the department um you
 
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
know where our regulatory and attorney
 
00:47:58.349 --> 00:47:58.359 align:start position:0%
staff would be the most likely to have
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
some participation in a future where um
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
we are more uh or we participate more in
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
the sighting
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
process go ahead so just to follow on
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
the other three items that came up which
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
I think are relevant here um one of the
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
difficulties people seem to have whether
 
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
it's with Staffing and expertise or with
 
00:48:26.589 --> 00:48:26.599 align:start position:0%
funding of positions
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
um comes from the fact that citing
 
00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
matters are not a consistent you know we
 
00:48:34.109 --> 00:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
don't have a revolving door we don't
 
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
have cases rolling all the time and so
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
one of the suggestions was to have
 
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
standard meeting times to say like the
 
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:41.720 align:start position:0%
first three days of the month are
 
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
devoted to SEC and then of course if
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
there's no work then uh but at least
 
00:48:49.549 --> 00:48:49.559 align:start position:0%
people who have scheduling issues would
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
understand to that they'd have to look
 
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
at whether or not there was anything
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
upcoming um wondered if you could
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
comment ment on that and then I'll
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
um well I'll just put it out there now
 
00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
so you can think about it the other one
 
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
was from someone who is a CEO at um at
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
bow at a at a energy plant saying that
 
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
there should be a defined process for
 
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
existing plants that would be sort of a
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
subset of what would happen if you were
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
citing a new a new energy project so I I
 
00:49:23.789 --> 00:49:23.799 align:start position:0%
think I don't know where that decision
 
00:49:25.549 --> 00:49:25.559 align:start position:0%
comes in but again if you've got
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
expertise on that panel then each case
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
would be looked at uh in a unique way
 
00:49:34.109 --> 00:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
and if it was an existing plant asking
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
for permitting for some new repurpose of
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
that plant uh that would probably be a
 
00:49:42.789 --> 00:49:42.799 align:start position:0%
less arduous and lengthy process than
 
00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
somebody who was trying to get a permit
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
for something new does an existing
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.910 align:start position:0%
 
recall

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
recall
 
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
I have to stretch my memory I know it
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
does cover substantial additions I could
 
00:50:02.589 --> 00:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
help out here Mr chairman yeah it's a
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
substantial change the problem of course
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
is that uh everybody has a different
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
definition of what a substantial change
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
is when they put the scrubber on the
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
meramac plant that was a huge debate on
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
what exactly constituted a substantial
 
00:50:17.069 --> 00:50:17.079 align:start position:0%
change so there is a provision in there
 
00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:19.559 align:start position:0%
to drastically minimize the amount of
 
00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
going but it's that definition of
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
substantial change that's not defined in
 
00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:26.119 align:start position:0%
um I don't know exactly how you come up
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
with one that that can be defined I
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
guess you could come up with something
 
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
that says you know the value of the
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
plant is x amount of money and if you're
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
going to spend more than 10 10% of that
 
00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
then it's a substantial change or
 
00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:39.079 align:start position:0%
something but right now it's not defined
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
and and I I think F further legislative
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
Clarity there would be helpful I think
 
00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
from a policy perspective we would be
 
00:50:47.789 --> 00:50:47.799 align:start position:0%
supportive of something that that made
 
00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
that more clear um to your first
 
00:50:54.069 --> 00:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
question representative um I would defer
 
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
that if you don't mind to either the the
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
SEC administrator or the Pu we just
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:07.789 --> 00:51:07.799 align:start position:0%
scheduling representative Arrington yeah
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
yeah one thing I noce the the the
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
funding issue has come up a lot over the
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
years and it is obviously something that
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
has to be addressed but I think we need
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
to make a very basic decision on this
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
the original intent was that the funding
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
was going to be provided by the
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
applicant and that's why they have this
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
various fees that they have to file when
 
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
they do this so the concept was that um
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
the members of the side of evaluation
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
committee were going to take on other
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
duties as assigned uh to fill their role
 
00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
on that committee but as far as the uh
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
the cost of we had it uh like I say Mike
 
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
I capino was the outside attorney his
 
00:51:45.789 --> 00:51:45.799 align:start position:0%
his uh costs uh any Consultants whatever
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
all that was taken as a charge to the
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
applicant so if we want to go away from
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
that that's a that's a real basic
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
decision I think needs to be made up
 
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
front the is the con concept going to
 
00:51:57.549 --> 00:51:57.559 align:start position:0%
stay with the idea if you want to build
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
something and it cost the state x amount
 
00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:01.240 align:start position:0%
of money to approve it then you should
 
00:52:04.109 --> 00:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
be paying a a good a good portion of
 
00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
that money in order to get it so and
 
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
that that's something that we need to
 
00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:09.799 align:start position:0%
look at and thank you representative I I
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
would just reiterate that's that's uh
 
00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
why I think it would be a a something we
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
would strongly recommend to have the SEC
 
00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%
administrator be a part of the SEC or
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
the Pu staff um so that there are those
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
times where you know it's a chunky sort
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
of uh flow that that where there are not
 
00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh projects pending the SEC
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
administrator can continue to work work
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
efficiently and if they're doing say
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
utility assessment funded work then they
 
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
can be funded properly and we don't we
 
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
remove that lumpiness um and smooth that
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
out now HB
 
00:52:52.349 --> 00:52:52.359 align:start position:0%
281 did add language to statute about
 
00:52:54.789 --> 00:52:54.799 align:start position:0%
funding it for example gave the
 
00:52:54.799 --> 00:52:56.270 align:start position:0%
funding it for example gave the
department

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
the ability to charge directly to the
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
application for any monitoring and
 
00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement costs that the department
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
incurs and it also allows the department
 
00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
to engage additional technical legal or
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
administrative support to fulfill the
 
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
requirements of of uh this chapter
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
SEC that was pretty specific to the
 
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
Department itself do you think there's
 
00:53:30.789 --> 00:53:30.799 align:start position:0%
other funding support that the SEC
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
itself needs beyond
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
that I'll let David jump in here in a
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
sec but to do my to do my part um I
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
think you know obviously when we're
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
talking about new funding or resources
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
we aren't talking about on behalf of the
 
00:53:45.069 --> 00:53:45.079 align:start position:0%
department I think we feel we're well
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
well situated with the passage of 281 to
 
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
fulfill our responsibilities within the
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
statute we are just envisioning you know
 
00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
the difficulties that the Pu or the SEC
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
whatever ever it ends up being might
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
have uh and and we could certainly think
 
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
and and look at what might needed to be
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
added to so that they have the resources
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
they need David that was kind of a word
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
salad I
 
00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
did I he's accurate that we did make
 
00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
sure that we got all of the funding that
 
00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.030 align:start position:0%
sure that we got all of the funding that
we

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
needed um I would have to go back and
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
the look at the the commission's needs
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
the puc's needs well maybe this would be
 
00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
good segue to U ask you gentlemen to
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
step aside and bring up drew breamer the
 
00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
current SEC administrator uh to maybe
 
00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
clarify some of these questions for us
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
um based on his experience and his
 
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the SEC
 
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
process so Mr Breer could you refresh us
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
for how long you have actually been the
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
SEC administrator at this
 
00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:57.190 align:start position:0%
SEC administrator at this
point

00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.190 --> 00:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
microphone it's been about 16 months I
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
came on in very early July of last year
 
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
okay great so we'll come back to the
 
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
funding question but I think it's
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
important to address a couple of the
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
questions that my colleagues have raised
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
with regard to the operation of the
 
00:55:22.589 --> 00:55:22.599 align:start position:0%
SEC one
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
was the question of churn
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner described it where
 
00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
a revolving door of persons being on the
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
committee off the committee on the
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
committee off the committee
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
Etc is that an issue that we could
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
somehow figure out how to address that
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
would be my first question and then the
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
second question is the question that
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative McGee raised
 
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.789 align:start position:0%
representative McGee raised
expertise

00:55:55.789 --> 00:55:55.799 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:57.640 align:start position:0%
so representative Corman thinks we need
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
a public member on the
 
00:55:59.839 --> 00:56:01.589 align:start position:0%
a public member on the
SEC

00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
SEC
 
00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:05.480 align:start position:0%
but I think we frequently end up with an
 
00:56:08.589 --> 00:56:08.599 align:start position:0%
expertise deficit if we have a public
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
member on the
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
SEC so I'd like to hear you address both
 
00:56:14.349 --> 00:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
churn and
 
00:56:14.359 --> 00:56:16.710 align:start position:0%
churn and
expertise

00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
and suggest any remedies that we might
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
legislatively pursue for those two
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
issues regarding the churn we certainly
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people cycle through on
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
the antrum investigative subcommittee
 
00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
it's a three-person
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh one of those is a Dees
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
design we've had three of them in the
 
00:56:41.029 --> 00:56:41.039 align:start position:0%
year that I've been on the
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
SEC um a couple of them retired if I
 
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:48.200 align:start position:0%
recall correctly and um one of them was
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
sick and needed to be um
 
00:56:56.029 --> 00:56:56.039 align:start position:0%
replaced my preference is to schedule
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
these things when we can get as many
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
people there as possible we can always
 
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:01.559 align:start position:0%
roll with a
 
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
quorum but on a panel that is comprised
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
of nine people I think we should get as
 
00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
close to nine as we can on any hearing
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
so the um churn has been an issue
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
because when you get new people in there
 
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
all the time um you're always bringing
 
00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
them up to speed on the history of the
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
case imagine any other adjudicative
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
proceeding that you might be involved in
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
that involved a court and then imagine
 
00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
they keep cycling in a new judge or they
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
keep replacing members of the jury it
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
just hurts
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
continuity the issue with the
 
00:57:40.109 --> 00:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
scheduling um that representative
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
Harrington referred to is that you know
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
the folks we rely on with the expertise
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
meaning the uh commissioners of
 
00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:51.950 align:start position:0%
meaning the uh commissioners of
different

00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
departments they will typically appoint
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
a design
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
and that design will be of varying
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
expertise I've been blessed so far
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
they've all been very good
 
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.349 align:start position:0%
they've all been very good
um

00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
but um you know scheduling them when
 
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
they have a full-time job working for
 
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
the state and then scheduling the public
 
00:58:19.029 --> 00:58:19.039 align:start position:0%
members is always a little bit of an
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
issue and um we have had a public
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
meeting we've been trying to have for a
 
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
couple months now it's just a endof year
 
00:58:29.309 --> 00:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
business meeting of the
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
SEC and it keeps getting delayed just
 
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
based on different things coming up and
 
00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
different people not being able to make
 
00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
it and the issues we're going to
 
00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
deliberate at this as far as business
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
goes a lot of them have to do with the
 
00:58:44.029 --> 00:58:44.039 align:start position:0%
operations of the committee what our uh
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
protocol will be for remote
 
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:48.280 align:start position:0%
participation things like that and we
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
really want everybody to be there
 
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
because we want them all to have input
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
and it's really difficult finding a Time
 
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
when they're all going to be there so um
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
regarding the aggregation of
 
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
expertise I think
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
optically it certainly um looks like
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
we're aggregating a lot of expertise on
 
00:59:10.349 --> 00:59:10.359 align:start position:0%
the committee um I think the fact is
 
00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
that when you look at the permitting
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
process sort of holistically
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
here if you're going to build or attempt
 
00:59:20.029 --> 00:59:20.039 align:start position:0%
to build let's just say a transmission
 
00:59:23.069 --> 00:59:23.079 align:start position:0%
line you're going to have to go to Dees
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
for some type of wetland perm probably
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
and you're going to have to go to dot
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
because you're going to cross a highway
 
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
and you're going to have to go to
 
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
cultural resources and you're probably
 
00:59:33.309 --> 00:59:33.319 align:start position:0%
also going to have to go to fishing game
 
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
even though they're not on the SEC and
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to go to all of these
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
agencies where they have their own
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
experts review the project as part of
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
their own internal permitting process
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
that also includes public meetings by
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
the way so I don't really
 
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
see the lack of quote unquote experts as
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
AI ability I see the lack
 
01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
of being able to depend on what we would
 
01:00:03.029 --> 01:00:03.039 align:start position:0%
call hearing officers Andor professional
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
adjudicators people who know how to run
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
a hearing people who know how to
 
01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
adjudicate complex
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
matters again I've been blessed
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
everybody I've worked with public State
 
01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:18.799 align:start position:0%
pu they've all been
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
great um but I think when we build a
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
system or when we try to build a system
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
that's resilient for the future we don't
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily base it on the fact that I
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
am quite fond of commissioner Scott I
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
think he's great you know so I would
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
love for him to continue on the SEC but
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
does it make sense to keep Dees on the
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
SEC just because I like commissioner
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
Scott you know um I don't know um that's
 
01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
that's for you folks to decide but I
 
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
think the cleanest way is to bring the
 
01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
process in alignment with the current
 
01:00:58.270 --> 01:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
people pu process um the simple first
 
01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:01.559 align:start position:0%
step would be at minimum to move me over
 
01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:06.039 align:start position:0%
to the Pu even if we keep the entire SEC
 
01:01:10.589 --> 01:01:10.599 align:start position:0%
committee the way it is because I have
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
virtually no resources I have to rely
 
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
pretty heavily on external Consultants
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
to get things done um and I could be an
 
01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:22.039 align:start position:0%
extra set of hands for the commission as
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
needed and they could be an extra set of
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
hands for me when we have a big project
 
01:01:28.079 --> 01:01:30.109 align:start position:0%
hands for me when we have a big project
come

01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
come
 
01:01:32.829 --> 01:01:32.839 align:start position:0%
through excellent I appreciate those
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
answers but before we leave the question
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
of churn I have to ask you your opinion
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
of the potential of the suggested um
 
01:01:43.029 --> 01:01:43.039 align:start position:0%
change that we have been discussing here
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
this morning about reducing the number
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
of members on the SEC from its current
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
level of 9
 
01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
to5 even if uh even if we can't right
 
01:01:58.269 --> 01:01:58.279 align:start position:0%
this minute determine who those five
 
01:01:58.279 --> 01:01:59.069 align:start position:0%
this minute determine who those five
would

01:01:59.069 --> 01:01:59.079 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
be would reducing the number to five
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
reduce the churn
 
01:02:08.029 --> 01:02:08.039 align:start position:0%
problem absolutely it would reduce the
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
churn problem and mostly because the Pu
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
are full-time adjudicators for the state
 
01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
you know um they're not when you're
 
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
relying on the do commissioner or the
 
01:02:19.829 --> 01:02:19.839 align:start position:0%
dees commissioner um they they have very
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
serious responsibilities managing very
 
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
large complex agencies um
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
they do a very good job on the SEC but
 
01:02:31.269 --> 01:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
oftentimes rely on designes my
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
preference would be to reduce it to the
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
members of the Pu I also agree with what
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner Elms had to say that if
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
there are going to be additional
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
members doe probably wouldn't be a great
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
choice because they're already going to
 
01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
be involved doj probably wouldn't be a
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
good choice because they're already
 
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
going to be involved as well
 
01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
um if you were looking for the most
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
gerine Department that would probably be
 
01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
do and Dees because everything goes
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
through the environment and everything
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
crosses a highway or uses right of way
 
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
you know most things so if you were
 
01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
going to do that model I think something
 
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
along the lines of Dees and do would
 
01:03:16.589 --> 01:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
work but my preference is to just have
 
01:03:18.029 --> 01:03:18.039 align:start position:0%
it go to the
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
Pu final question uh on this issue if we
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
did reduce the commission to the three
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
Commissioners the commissioner of Dees
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
and then a fifth member and if that
 
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
fifth member was a member of the
 
01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
public could we would it be useful to
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
require that that person have be a
 
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
experience it's a good question um when
 
01:03:50.269 --> 01:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
we just when we talk about the members
 
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
of the public and again I've been very
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
blessed I just want to reiterate that um
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of people seem to think that this
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
is sort of like jury duty you know where
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
you're getting like a Grassroots you
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
know person on the committee and these
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
folks are really um politically
 
01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
connected people who are you know close
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
to the governor and I've been blessed I
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
had Mayor Bob Baines from Manchester he
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
was great uh Senate President Tom Eaton
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
was great um you know um um Susan Dupri
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
is great they're all they're all great
 
01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
but um they're not necessarily bringing
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
expertise I know that one of the
 
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
full-time public members presently has
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
to be an attorney um it doesn't specify
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
what type of attorney they just have to
 
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
be a member of the
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
bar um I would say this if we were going
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
to have a public member that would be
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
helpful yes that would be very helpful
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
now I again my preference is that we
 
01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
just go to the Pu but if we're going
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
going to do some hybrid model of the Pu
 
01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
plus Dees plus a public member then
 
01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:04.119 align:start position:0%
having that member be a lawyer would be
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
helpful because you know keeping in mind
 
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
one of the Pu Commissioners is always an
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
attorney one is always a uh engineer I
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
believe and then in this case uh prep is
 
01:05:18.269 --> 01:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
an economist so um they they kind of
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
round out the expertise pretty well
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
presently um but I see no harm in making
 
01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
a requirement that that person be a
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
lawyer okay and as I promised we'll now
 
01:05:32.269 --> 01:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
move on to the question of
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
funding the uh unless you had a had
 
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
question about M okay one other question
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
about membership I one too I think Tom
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
or maybe or maybe
 
01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
three maybe okay go ahead okay in
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
listening to the description of the
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
makeup of the committee um I think I
 
01:05:53.789 --> 01:05:53.799 align:start position:0%
understand the idea of having someone
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
with legal experience being helpful to
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
them understanding their role as in in
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
an adjudicative setting but we had
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier on and I believe
 
01:06:09.309 --> 01:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
um uh Mr shulock also reiterated the
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
idea of having land used expertise
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
available to the body um and I think
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
that the that that land use perspective
 
01:06:19.269 --> 01:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
could be an expertise that we require of
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
the public member rather than having
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
them just be involved with an
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
environmental group or something like
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
that if if the person actually had
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
background in understanding land use
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
they might be more helpful to the board
 
01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
because they would bring an expertise
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
that maybe doesn't reside on the board
 
01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
already so I'm wondering whether we
 
01:06:39.549 --> 01:06:39.559 align:start position:0%
could get a land use attorney or require
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
something really specific in terms of
 
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
want I think you know that idea is
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
sounds fine to me um you know the issue
 
01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
with um just having the person be a
 
01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
member of the bar in good standing is
 
01:07:00.029 --> 01:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
does a Veterinary malpractice attorney
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
really bring anything you know like
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
unique experience or a DUI attorney you
 
01:07:08.029 --> 01:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
know probably not so to the extent that
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
we can um require a public member or a
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
theoretical future public member to have
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
subject matter experience I think it it
 
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't hurt yeah representative
 
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
Harrington has a
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you um I'm just
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
going to go through the scenario let's
 
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
just leave the adjudicate process here
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
aside let's say it's the Pu or whether
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
it's I think obviously reducing the
 
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
numbers from 9 to 5 or 9 to three is
 
01:07:33.309 --> 01:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
going to be a huge step in the right
 
01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
direction towards getting rid of the
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
so-called churn as well as the
 
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
scheduling issues but what I'm trying to
 
01:07:41.549 --> 01:07:41.559 align:start position:0%
Envision here is we we keep talking
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
about expertise yet we have a huge
 
01:07:45.549 --> 01:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
amount of expertise in the state between
 
01:07:47.069 --> 01:07:47.079 align:start position:0%
as you said just about anything that
 
01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
gets built it's got to get it whether
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's a supermarket or a manufacturing
 
01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
plant or a energy plant has to get
 
01:07:56.829 --> 01:07:56.839 align:start position:0%
permits from Dees do and who knows who
 
01:07:58.670 --> 01:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
else maybe fishing game if it's
 
01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
affecting something so we have that
 
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
expertise there I would Envision and I
 
01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
want to get your your thoughts on this
 
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
is that the de Dees Department of energy
 
01:08:11.069 --> 01:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
would be the sort of the advocate for
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire and they
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
would uh uh address all the appropriate
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
departments basic could be every
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
Department in the state and say Here's
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
what's going on someone wants to build
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
an energy project here's a description
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
of it if you want to get involved
 
01:08:28.030 --> 01:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
contact us and we'll represent you uh at
 
01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
any future hearings so that every
 
01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
department will have as much input as
 
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
they feel they need or if it's a case of
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
someone that says you know this there's
 
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
no issues here with uh fishing game or
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
the state parks department or whatever
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
so we don't need to be involved but they
 
01:08:44.829 --> 01:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
would be the coordinator of that and if
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
there was a shortage of expertise on
 
01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
some particular project because it was
 
01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
different or unique or brought on some
 
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
new thing that hadn't been thought of
 
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
then uh they could get a consultant to
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh come in and give expertise on that
 
01:09:02.269 --> 01:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
and you know of course you would be the
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
coordinator of all this but then it
 
01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
would be sort of we would
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
have the state through the department of
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
energy Department of energy we would
 
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
have the state through the through
 
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:13.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice through the
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office representing
 
01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
the general public then we'd have any
 
01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
interveners which would normally be
 
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
groups of people maybe the towns it's
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
going to be in typically they they file
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
for interven status uh it could be some
 
01:09:28.269 --> 01:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
outside Environmental Group or something
 
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
like such as that and these would all be
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
making their case in front of the uh
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
whoever this adjudicative body was does
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
that seem like a workable uh platform
 
01:09:38.799 --> 01:09:39.669 align:start position:0%
that seem like a workable uh platform
for

01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:45.400 align:start position:0%
you I am uh hesitant to um suggest how
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
Dees theoretically should you know be
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
involved outside the way they're they're
 
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
currently involved I wish there was a
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
Dees person here
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
um when you say d you're talking
 
01:09:59.950 --> 01:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services yes sir okay yes
 
01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
sir and it was I I apologize you had
 
01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
said Dees would be kind of the
 
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
aggregator no Department of energy
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
energy energy department and they would
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
contact Dees because obviously anybody
 
01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
that's going to build something like
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
this is going to get multiple permits
 
01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
from Dees they're going to probably get
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
multiple permits from dot maybe fishing
 
01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
game and maybe some other agency I
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
haven't even heard of but the department
 
01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
of energy would be the coordinated to
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
make sure every con every Department was
 
01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
contacted and every Department that it
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
import was represented so if it say if
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's a somewhat of a minor issue with
 
01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:35.719 align:start position:0%
fishing game rather than have somebody
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
attend days and days and days of hearing
 
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
they could make their presentation
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
through the through the department of
 
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
energy and you know if and when someone
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
had to testify they could do that but
 
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be a main coordinator of
 
01:10:50.590 --> 01:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
it they would say okay call me up when
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
you need me to come and I'll be there
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
for the two hours that I need to testify
 
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
on why we need to protect the bnell
 
01:10:58.750 --> 01:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
thrush or something like that uh but
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
that would be their involvement and then
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
you would also of course have the the
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
public Advocate through the Department
 
01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:07.239 align:start position:0%
of Justice but uh rather than have each
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
department trying to come in there and
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
do something they would all work through
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
the department of energy um I'm gonna
 
01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
let commissioner Elms take that maybe
 
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
after you folks are is that appropriate
 
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
sir okay thank you yeah that's fine all
 
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
right let's move on to the question of
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
funding uh whoops representative Corman
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
has a question first thank you Mr
 
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
chairman excuse me I have a couple of
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
questions one is with the current
 
01:11:37.629 --> 01:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
composition and with the proposed
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
composition there are ex officio
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
positions and then members of the
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
public for
 
01:11:49.149 --> 01:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
different uh different applications do
 
01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
the members of the public vary or is it
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
that you're appointed to the SEC and you
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
hear everything during your
 
01:11:59.629 --> 01:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
term we have uh two full members the
 
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
full members are presently James jalbert
 
01:12:04.629 --> 01:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
and Susan Dupri one of those is required
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
to be an attorney that is uh Miss Dupri
 
01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
we also have part-time members okay so
 
01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
when the full SEC convenes it is only
 
01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
the full-time members who participate
 
01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
it's only Jim jalbert and Susan dpri as
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
the public members the part-time public
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
members who in my tenure have included
 
01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
Bob Baines Tom Eaton uh Lisa
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
no um and um um um George casses okay
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
four of them they are drawn at random to
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
sit on subcommittees presently so when
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
we form a
 
01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee the commissioner the
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
chairperson commissioner goldner will
 
01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
appoint a
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh that will typically
 
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
include one member of the Pu although it
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't always have to it'll include one
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
of the other members of the full SEC and
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
then it will include one of these
 
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
part-time public members who are drawn
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
at random and the statute actually
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
specifies they have to be drawn out of a
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
hat okay once you've been drawn you
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
don't come up again until I've cycled
 
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
through everybody so theoretically it
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
could be a drawing of of one name you
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
know but the way it works is you know um
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner goldner says we have a we
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
need a subcommittee for this issue with
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
C Brook um I'm appointing prep I'm
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
appointing um you know commissioner
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
Scott and then I'm instructing the
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
administrator to draw the name of a
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
public member out of a hat um
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott sends us a letter
 
01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
saying I'm appointing soand so from my
 
01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
department to sit in my stad Drew takes
 
01:13:50.629 --> 01:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
a hat um draws a name out and the name I
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
draw is Tom Eaton so then Tom Eaton is
 
01:13:55.149 --> 01:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
is the public member on that docket on
 
01:13:56.669 --> 01:13:56.679 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee level so you have
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
full-time members right now and you have
 
01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
part-time members the
 
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
full-timers participate on the full nine
 
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
member uh panel and the part-time
 
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
members only participate on
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittees so it's it's a little odd
 
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
but the uh you know it's just how we do
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
it theoretically to break up the work
 
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee structure was was
 
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
implemented with the idea that it would
 
01:14:27.149 --> 01:14:27.159 align:start position:0%
create less work uh for the full
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
committee yeah thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you that was very helpful thank
 
01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
you sir uh my second question relates to
 
01:14:35.790 --> 01:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
this uh notion of flexibility so right
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
now you are not under the Pu as I
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
understand it but you're suggesting
 
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps you should be within the Pu
 
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.390 align:start position:0%
perhaps you should be within the Pu
administrative

01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
umbrella um and and I understand the
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
desire for the
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility the question is do you
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
always have work in front of you
 
01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
I was have sorry I always have some work
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
in front of me it's I'm not always super
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
busy um you know um recently I've been
 
01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
focusing on things like this and we're
 
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
applying for some federal grants so
 
01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
there's there's enough things going on
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
um the thing that kept me busy
 
01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.350 align:start position:0%
um the thing that kept me busy
predominantly

01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
predominantly
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
um up until the legislative change that
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
sent enforcement to doe was the
 
01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement because the way enforcement
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
worked with me with the onep person
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
agency is I would do some of the
 
01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
investigation myself I would rely
 
01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
heavily on either intragovernmental
 
01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
billing to bring people from other
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
departments in um in this case there was
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
a sound issue so we brought in the sound
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
guy from
 
01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
do um and then he just sends me bills
 
01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:45.320 align:start position:0%
and we also rely heavily on external
 
01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:47.719 align:start position:0%
contractors we hired a Contracting firm
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
that does sound studies for a lot of uh
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
wind farms in the Commonwealth of
 
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and had a good TR track
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
record um the issue there with
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
Outsourcing investigations to um
 
01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:00.310 align:start position:0%
Outsourcing investigations to um
external

01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
external
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
contractors is um you know optically I
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
prefer that the state the state as a
 
01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
proper entity handle investigations you
 
01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
know similarly to how if if you were
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
being investigated for something by the
 
01:16:13.229 --> 01:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
state and they said we're just going to
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
Outsource the investigation to this Law
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
Firm you know to do it instead of you
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
know instead of the AG doing it so um
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
we've done um um I forget the question I
 
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
apologize want a little tangent there
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
well so just to to finish up would it be
 
01:16:33.149 --> 01:16:33.159 align:start position:0%
fair to say that with uh enforcement
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
moving over to doe that does free up
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
some of your time and therefore you
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
would be more useful to the puc were you
 
01:16:45.229 --> 01:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
to be transferred to pu yes that's
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
accurate and um you know the Pu um will
 
01:16:50.629 --> 01:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
EB and flow just like the SEC will EB
 
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
and flow they have a steadier workload
 
01:16:57.790 --> 01:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
than I do of course um I think their
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
interpretation um and by they I mean the
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
the commission the three Commissioners
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
is that I would be
 
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
useful um as kind of a flex player over
 
01:17:09.149 --> 01:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
there to pick up work as assigned and
 
01:17:11.629 --> 01:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
then in the instance of me having a lot
 
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
of work so the theoretical massive
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
transmission project big sighting of an
 
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
energy facility I would be able to
 
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
borrow one of their staff attorneys or
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
staff analysts to be a second set of
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
hands for me so it would be a lot of
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
give and take I think it would work um
 
01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
pretty well you know because um we we're
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
trying to be efficient here I think in
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we do that very well and
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
um you know the alternative would
 
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
probably be just growing the SEC giving
 
01:17:40.629 --> 01:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
me staff and that doesn't really make
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
sense because then you'd have people
 
01:17:45.149 --> 01:17:45.159 align:start position:0%
sitting around doing nothing whereas
 
01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
instead of having more people doing
 
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
nothing we have an opportunity here to
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
make the people we already have do more
 
01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
you know so right thank you
 
01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.110 align:start position:0%
you know so right thank you
representative

01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:18:01.149 --> 01:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I would like
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
to put the question to you where you
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
talked about scheduling upfront in your
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
testimony um the question of whether
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
having stand standard meeting times or
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know regular
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
SEC date and time would be helpful to
 
01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
all the participants involved if you had
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
sort of a standing meeting that could be
 
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
canceled if you didn't have any business
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
before the SEC but if you went the
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation in the um in the panel
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
discussion was the first three days of
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
the month you know that kind of thing so
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how long is generally set
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
aside for hearings when they do come but
 
01:18:39.149 --> 01:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
that type of an idea do you think that
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
would be something that would be helpful
 
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
to you it would be in the in the present
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
volume of work that the full SEC gets
 
01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
which the the sub committees have been
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
meeting more regularly but in the
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
present volume that the full SEC gets it
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
would result in just a lot of cancelled
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh meetings now I've brought this idea
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
up um to commissioner goldner he likes
 
01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
the idea too I said there's less
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
likelihood of having difficulty I mean I
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
served on the state juvenile parole
 
01:19:08.189 --> 01:19:08.199 align:start position:0%
board those meetings were all
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
articulated a year in advance y you know
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
they'd give you the calendar you'd look
 
01:19:13.229 --> 01:19:13.239 align:start position:0%
at it you'd say I can't be here then
 
01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
then and then but I can be there the
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
rest of the time and then the
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
administrator can plan ahead and they
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
can say I always know we're going to
 
01:19:22.629 --> 01:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
have a quorum you know um those meetings
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
are two weeks though so there were you
 
01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
know uh probably 20 of them in a year um
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
realistically if we had quarterly
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
meetings you know that would probably
 
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
work they've met twice the full SEC will
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
have met twice since I've been here um
 
01:19:38.669 --> 01:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
this second meeting is one that will
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
always happen because it's an annual
 
01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
business meeting to go over rules and
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
fees and things like that um but yeah I
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
that that's a great idea and it's one
 
01:19:50.590 --> 01:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
we've discussed and I think that uh we
 
01:19:52.990 --> 01:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
could do it anyway to be honest with you
 
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
I could schedule quarterly meetings and
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
then just you know when when no if no
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
business came up I could always cancel
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
them but that that would be helpful yes
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
and that's something I can obviously
 
01:20:05.629 --> 01:20:05.639 align:start position:0%
Implement without a without a statute
 
01:20:05.639 --> 01:20:06.950 align:start position:0%
Implement without a without a statute
change

01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
sure all right so funding is always a
 
01:20:13.470 --> 01:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
SEC it's been discussed that it would be
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
useful to make you an employee of the
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
Pu with float respons responsibilities
 
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
between the Pu and the
 
01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:28.639 align:start position:0%
SEC would that solve some of the funding
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:36.669 --> 01:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
has the SEC budget proper is basically
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
my salary plus administrative expenses
 
01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
you know I share administrative expenses
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
for the building for you know the the
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
front desk and you know copy machines
 
01:20:51.149 --> 01:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
and stuff um most of the expenses that
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
come through me
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
are actually funded by the applicant um
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
or the company in the case of the Anum
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
Wind Facility most of it was actually
 
01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
funded by Anam the way that that worked
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
was we were authorized to conduct an
 
01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
investigation that was authorized by the
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
SEC under Diane Martin a couple years
 
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
ago and the authorization basically said
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
that we capped the investigation at I
 
01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:15.510 align:start position:0%
that we capped the investigation at I
think

01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:21:17.629 --> 01:21:17.639 align:start position:0%
$100,000 um we were allowed to hire
 
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
external counsel um so we did both of
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
those things we hired a consulting firm
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
and ex internal uh legal and we passed
 
01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
through those bills on to um antrum
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
through attorney needlman as the
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative to us from antrum so they
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
would send the bills to me I would look
 
01:21:37.629 --> 01:21:37.639 align:start position:0%
at them make sure they made sense and
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
then I would approve them for payment by
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
the facility that's what happens
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
similarly on uh sighting you know and as
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
you pointed out earlier in a perfect
 
01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
world we have a flow of projects that is
 
01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
uh basically self- financing you know
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
Northern Pass paid for Mike I capino
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
they probably paid for other studies
 
01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
that were conducted um they paid for you
 
01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
know Council that had to be brought in
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
for different reasons so the funding
 
01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.830 align:start position:0%
for different reasons so the funding
issue

01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question I think the
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
funding issue can is mostly mitigated by
 
01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
the fact that I'm no longer doing
 
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement to be honest with you
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
because when I was doing enforcement but
 
01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
no applications so the past you know
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
year and a half we had a u capacitor
 
01:22:27.629 --> 01:22:27.639 align:start position:0%
bank at seab Brook that was a very minor
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
thing um but 90% of my time's been on
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement issues that is a
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
mismatch that was hard to navigate
 
01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
because we needed to keep going back and
 
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
getting General funds to finance things
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
and under the current construction or
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
the construction that's going to come
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
into play later this month is
 
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner Elm said he's confident
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
they have the resources to handle
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement and I no long longer will be
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
handling enforcement so I believe
 
01:22:58.669 --> 01:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
although I might make a liar out of
 
01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
myself here I believe that the ability
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
for the sighting function of the SEC to
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
be self- financing
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
is probably likely probably likely the
 
01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
one factor that would probably um be
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
needed and this is something I discuss
 
01:23:17.229 --> 01:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
discussed with um commissioner goldner
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
is in addition to just moving me over
 
01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
there as a net you know a net um wash as
 
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
far as payroll goes we would also want
 
01:23:29.229 --> 01:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
to hire an additional pu attorney or an
 
01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
additional pu analyst so to' be a net
 
01:23:35.629 --> 01:23:35.639 align:start position:0%
gain of one person but as far as funding
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
I think that under the um system as
 
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
intended um hopefully we'd have the
 
01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
level of applicants to finance what
 
01:23:43.950 --> 01:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
we're trying to
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
do okay great thank you representative
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
Harrington has a question yeah yeah I
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
know one of the proposals it um it says
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
all applicant's certificate of energy
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
facility shall be filed with the
 
01:23:57.149 --> 01:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
chairperson of the site evaluation
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee I'm envisioning that this
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
would go to whoever that chairperson was
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
then quickly go to you and you would go
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
through the Fairly lengthy process of
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
evaluating the application and making
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
sure it was complete and it hit all the
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
buttons it was supposed to and so forth
 
01:24:12.910 --> 01:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding it would
 
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
probably just be cc to me in the first
 
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:16.280 align:start position:0%
place okay you know correspondence to
 
01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
Beamer well we thank you for being here
 
01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
and uh responding to our queries thank
 
01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.430 align:start position:0%
and uh responding to our queries thank
you

01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
okay um is there anybody else who has
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
listened to this conversation today who
 
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
would like to make input Mr Monahan we'd
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.629 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:53.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman I'm Jim Mahan
 
01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
with the DuPont group and I here today
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
on behalf of a a few clients but that
 
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
would include the New England power
 
01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
generators and as well as some other
 
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
clients I have that are members of the
 
01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
New England power generators that have
 
01:25:09.870 --> 01:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
existing uh generating facilities uh in
 
01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and so in a minute I'm
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
going to make a uh outline a specific
 
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
proposal but I did want to uh respond to
 
01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that came up today
 
01:25:21.709 --> 01:25:21.719 align:start position:0%
because in this context I've worked I
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
have the list but probably eight or 10
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
clients I've worked with that have gone
 
01:25:29.109 --> 01:25:29.119 align:start position:0%
through the site evaluation process um
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
over the last decade or so and they
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
range from uh small refinancings to the
 
01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
C3 propane project to Northern Pass so
 
01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
I've been on it for some time so um let
 
01:25:43.229 --> 01:25:43.239 align:start position:0%
me just uh some uh a couple things that
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
came up today they want to offer some um
 
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
feedback on um first of all um uh you
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
rightly identified the issue around the
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
need for some statutory Clarity around
 
01:25:58.830 --> 01:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
the substantial addition section of
 
01:26:01.149 --> 01:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
state law uh we looked at it from the
 
01:26:03.390 --> 01:26:03.400 align:start position:0%
perspective of could we use that to make
 
01:26:05.550 --> 01:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
a more efficient process for a
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
repowering of EX of an existing power
 
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
plant the problem is um is and I
 
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
actually worked with Tom gs on this and
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
we didn't solve it uh last year that if
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
you're deemed if your project is deemed
 
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:21.639 align:start position:0%
not to be uh a substantial addition you
 
01:26:24.109 --> 01:26:24.119 align:start position:0%
would then exempt from the S evaluation
 
01:26:26.109 --> 01:26:26.119 align:start position:0%
process but then that means you have to
 
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
go through local um uh Planning and
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
Zoning which I think is what folks are
 
01:26:35.709 --> 01:26:35.719 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid so um uh uh that may be
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
a tool but the what happens if you're
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
deemed not substantial uh is uh is an
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
issue um I have not taken the get's
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
proposal to NEPA yet to see what they
 
01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
think about it um but I will um one of
 
01:26:53.109 --> 01:26:53.119 align:start position:0%
the observations I I think I think I
 
01:26:57.790 --> 01:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
will hear is um uh when and my clients
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
are unregulated they don't typically
 
01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
have business before the Public
 
01:27:04.030 --> 01:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission their view is that
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
the pu's job is to balance the interest
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
of rate paays in shareholders we don't
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
have rate payers and so there's always
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
the fear that if you subject yourself to
 
01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
the puc for this type of thing they're
 
01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
going to fall back on what they
 
01:27:20.189 --> 01:27:20.199 align:start position:0%
typically do which is take a look at the
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
finances and the impact on rates and
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
costs and things like that and I know
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington today said
 
01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
that um when it gets to the site
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee they take all these
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
financial and rate issues and they push
 
01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
him aside they don't deal with them um
 
01:27:35.709 --> 01:27:35.719 align:start position:0%
and I know he was not on the SEC during
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
the Northern Pass proceeding but that
 
01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:40.280 align:start position:0%
was a huge issue Northern Pass came in
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
and said let us build this thing because
 
01:27:45.109 --> 01:27:45.119 align:start position:0%
it's going to lower rates and the whole
 
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
role of uh uh the intervention of of um
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
nepco was around that issue
 
01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh and so I think that uh it does bleed
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
into it and frankly I and I don't have
 
01:28:00.189 --> 01:28:00.199 align:start position:0%
an answer for you about who the the the
 
01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
members should be but that's a concern
 
01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:05.800 align:start position:0%
that um if you to a carpenter everything
 
01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
looks like a nail if you're a hammer
 
01:28:08.430 --> 01:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
everything looks like a nail that's the
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
problem if you wait this heavily with
 
01:28:12.189 --> 01:28:12.199 align:start position:0%
participation from the Public Utilities
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
Commission uh their view is that uh
 
01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
because you're avoiding local Planning
 
01:28:19.229 --> 01:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
and Zoning uh the role of the site
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee outside of the
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
agency permits is more of a land use
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
issue so again I don't have an answer
 
01:28:28.990 --> 01:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
for you observation um but what I did
 
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
want to talk take the temperature of the
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on today uh is uh something
 
01:28:36.109 --> 01:28:36.119 align:start position:0%
that has come up previously it was a big
 
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
part of the conversation at the um uh at
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
the panel for the site evaluation
 
01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
committee and that is uh uh should we
 
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
think about creating a separate track uh
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
for site evaluation committee approval
 
01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
uh for projects that are going to be
 
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
located at existing sites
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
I think what you heard from the part of
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
the panel was the among the challenges
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
are the site evaluation process moves
 
01:29:02.669 --> 01:29:02.679 align:start position:0%
slower than the financial markets and
 
01:29:05.149 --> 01:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
movees slower than supply chain uh
 
01:29:09.629 --> 01:29:09.639 align:start position:0%
issues and so uh we uh presume that uh
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
we will see an influx of activity on the
 
01:29:16.270 --> 01:29:16.280 align:start position:0%
on New Generation in Hampshire next two
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
three years as the uh uh Ira inflation
 
01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
reduction act and all the tax benefits
 
01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
of that begin to bleed uh into the
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
market people already penciling out
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
projects part of the reason some of them
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
AR moving forward is because we're still
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
awaiting guidance from the IRS and you
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
and US Department of Treasury uh with
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
the guidelines who come from that um but
 
01:29:41.229 --> 01:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
I would be very surprised if what you
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
didn't see is in the first round of this
 
01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
people trying to build additions to the
 
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
facilities or expand facilities where
 
01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
there's interconnection today in um um
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
our view is and what I'd like to float
 
01:29:56.109 --> 01:29:56.119 align:start position:0%
by the subcommittee is whether or not
 
01:29:58.750 --> 01:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 609 might be a vehicle for
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
taking a look at that track um I didn't
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
prepare language for this because it
 
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
would have been 18 pages long um if we
 
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
approached it by just amending the
 
01:30:13.229 --> 01:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
existing site evaluation U process and
 
01:30:15.149 --> 01:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
anywhere where there would be need
 
01:30:18.189 --> 01:30:18.199 align:start position:0%
changed for it for this uh incumbent
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
track U make a change it's lots of
 
01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
different changes and all that can be
 
01:30:27.149 --> 01:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
done um but I uh uh wanted to let the
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
committee know if you're interested is
 
01:30:30.149 --> 01:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
that we'd like to prepare a document
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
which outlines two things one would be
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
if a facility qualified for this um uh
 
01:30:41.070 --> 01:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
amended uh process what would that be
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
and so what we'll propose is that it's
 
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
in the same footprint as existing
 
01:30:48.669 --> 01:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
facility and that it's no larger than
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
the name plate capacity of the existing
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
facility Theory there is the people in
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
the community know what's there they
 
01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
know what's going on and a lot of the
 
01:30:59.109 --> 01:30:59.119 align:start position:0%
issues around uh the land use issues
 
01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
were dealt with previously and so we
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
could take some time out of the process
 
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
uh to get us there uh and then uh what
 
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
we'd like to be able to do is come
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
forward with a proposal that takes into
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
that takes into account that a lot of
 
01:31:13.870 --> 01:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
those things have already been dealt
 
01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
with and develop a process that would be
 
01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
six to S months long for these
 
01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
facilities rather than 12 to 14 months
 
01:31:23.310 --> 01:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
long at the but a big part of getting
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
there is congesting is condensing a lot
 
01:31:27.310 --> 01:31:27.320 align:start position:0%
of the stuff that happens at the
 
01:31:30.990 --> 01:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
beginning of the process um does there
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
need to be three public hearings on the
 
01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
location you know when you're doing a
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
130 mile long transmission facility
 
01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
probably but when it's at existing
 
01:31:43.390 --> 01:31:43.400 align:start position:0%
facility uh the concept of the
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
applicants proceeding and the
 
01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
2p U public information sessions can
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
probably be um crunched together then uh
 
01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
the other thought was that they outside
 
01:31:57.550 --> 01:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
of the formal process that there'd be a
 
01:31:59.669 --> 01:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
process to encourage the applicant to
 
01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
alert the um site evaluation committee
 
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
staff that a project is on the way so
 
01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
they can deal with the issues about
 
01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
scheduling alerting the agencies and
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
things like that and makes the
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
determination of a complete application
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
move along a little quicker so um that's
 
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
the first set of issues the other set of
 
01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
issues that uh you'd want to look at is
 
01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
the uh the four-part criteria that's
 
01:32:24.109 --> 01:32:24.119 align:start position:0%
used by the site evaluation committee to
 
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
deem whether or not a project is um uh
 
01:32:30.109 --> 01:32:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh should be granted certificate uh
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's RSA 162 h16 um and uh those
 
01:32:36.750 --> 01:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
criteria look at one of them looks at
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
the financial C capacity of the facility
 
01:32:42.109 --> 01:32:42.119 align:start position:0%
of of the project I think the thought
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
here is that if you're building at an
 
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
exist facility and you're able to
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
finance it you're probably in good shape
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
um that uh the site will not uh unduly
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
interfere with the AUD development of
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
the region with due consideration given
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
to the views of Municipal and Regional
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
planning commissions municipalities
 
01:33:01.149 --> 01:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
you're part of the community already um
 
01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to in engage with them um
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
then one where I think there may be the
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
need for some um uh changes is that the
 
01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
site and the facility will not have an
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
unreasonably adverse effect on
 
01:33:13.870 --> 01:33:13.880 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics historic sites air and water
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
quality natural environment and public
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
health and safety that's one I think
 
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
that we can probably float some changes
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
on because it's what you did in uh last
 
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
year's legislation was to say the
 
01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
environmental permitting that you do
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
with Dees and do and all those things
 
01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
that kind of drives the process and it
 
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be redone uh by the the
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee so um there I
 
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
think making reference to the fact that
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the application is is would be
 
01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
contingent upon receiving those other
 
01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
environmental uh land use permits from
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
the state would cover a lot of the
 
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
issues that are already there uh and
 
01:33:53.709 --> 01:33:53.719 align:start position:0%
then uh the last criteria is in the
 
01:33:55.149 --> 01:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
public interest we wouldn't necessarily
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
propose any changes to that um so um
 
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
rather as I said rather than giving you
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
18 Pages uh What uh if there's an
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
appetite from the committee I can take
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
the concepts of the of the um uh shorter
 
01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
timeline but touching the basis around
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
public participation and time for expert
 
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
um consideration as well as some uh
 
01:34:20.669 --> 01:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
modifications to what criteria would be
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
used for an existing site uh in a
 
01:34:25.149 --> 01:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
document for you to review if the
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
committee likes it then that would be
 
01:34:30.510 --> 01:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
you know turned into uh a Amendment to
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
the larger RSA or the drafting incur so
 
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
you could decide do we just rather than
 
01:34:38.669 --> 01:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
amend the complete uh process do we set
 
01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
up this different
 
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:44.360 align:start position:0%
track so um I've been the answer is yes
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay we would we would love to see that
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
document yes great okay and I'm happy to
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
share it with everyone behind me that's
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
they're probably all nodding their head
 
01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:55.400 align:start position:0%
this is a great idea let's do it but uh
 
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
we want to be as transparent as possible
 
01:34:58.270 --> 01:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
because we know you don't have a lot of
 
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
time uh and we'd like to advance the
 
01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
proposal for for comment as well
 
01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh actually just
 
01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
about one of the last things you said
 
01:35:12.750 --> 01:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
when you were talking about the criteria
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
and the uh the one about the site and
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
facility will not have an unreasonable
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
adverse effect on Aesthetics historic
 
01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
sites air and water quality natural
 
01:35:23.070 --> 01:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
environment and Public Health and safety
 
01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
I can imagine a scenario where the
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
footprint doesn't change where the name
 
01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
plate capacity doesn't change but the
 
01:35:31.390 --> 01:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
nature of the site
 
01:35:35.790 --> 01:35:35.800 align:start position:0%
changes and it could have some impact so
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
I would recommend still keeping that as
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
a Criterion and in cases where there's
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
really no change then it's just not a
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
big deal in the
 
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
application yes I agree and and to dig
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
into the Weeds on this I think what I'm
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
playing around with here is that when
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
the application is made uh that uh there
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
could be a
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
um uh uh um identification of where if
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
that criteria is being met by another
 
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
permit uh that's pending at DS or things
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
like that then it would be taken out of
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
the consideration the set evaluation
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh and um um that may be a way
 
01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
to do it because you can see a lot of
 
01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
the things that are listed there would
 
01:36:19.390 --> 01:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
be a part of your land use alteration
 
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
train permit or air permit those step to
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Harrington has a
 
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you yeah just to
 
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
follow up to what you just said I think
 
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
that's critically important uh in the
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
original application if the applicants
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
decides that because this is a
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
repowering of an existing site and the
 
01:36:39.390 --> 01:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
criteria you mentioned that the
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
following should not be an issue and why
 
01:36:44.669 --> 01:36:44.679 align:start position:0%
putting that in the initial application
 
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
and that having be the first thing that
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee rules on
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
and and if it does it gets it out of the
 
01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:51.790 align:start position:0%
and and if it does it gets it out of the
way

01:36:51.790 --> 01:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:36:54.109 --> 01:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
because if you don't do it that way
 
01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
maybe the uh public representative from
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office decides
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
he's going to bring them up three months
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
later or something like that so getting
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
them in upfront where they you say these
 
01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
are the things that do not have to be
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
considered because we've already got
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
this permit we already got that permit
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
whatever and get in a positive or ruling
 
01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
one way or the other from the committee
 
01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
on it before you go any further would be
 
01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
a big way of cutting down the process
 
01:37:20.109 --> 01:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
and anything you can do to come up with
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
a good definition of a substantial
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
modification or change would be helpful
 
01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
I think you're familiar with what we
 
01:37:27.109 --> 01:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
went through on the marac plan on that
 
01:37:28.990 --> 01:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
it was just there's absolutely no
 
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
guidance there whatsoever so you can do
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
it and say well you're spending a
 
01:37:35.229 --> 01:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
million you know $50 million but the
 
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
place is worth a billion dollars so
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
that's not really that substantial but
 
01:37:39.550 --> 01:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
to a lot of people say anything you
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
spend $50 million is unsubstantial by
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
definition so if you guys got any ideas
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
on that would' be more than happy to
 
01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159 align:start position:0%
listen to them great and I agree with
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
you I think that uh part of the um the
 
01:37:53.470 --> 01:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
determination of the completeness of the
 
01:37:55.709 --> 01:37:55.719 align:start position:0%
application if the application
 
01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
included that these other criteria are
 
01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
met by other pending permits then you
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
know the first decision that the SEC
 
01:38:06.589 --> 01:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
makes is on completeness it would elimin
 
01:38:09.589 --> 01:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
it would re it would resolve those those
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
issues down the road if you because if
 
01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
you don't do it then you'll be doing it
 
01:38:15.310 --> 01:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
forever yep Y and I should say uh Comm
 
01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh Tom get and I did come up with a
 
01:38:19.709 --> 01:38:19.719 align:start position:0%
definition on the substantial addition
 
01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
last year I have to go back and find it
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
the problem was that maybe you don't
 
01:38:24.430 --> 01:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
want that because then you have to go to
 
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
the local planning board that's why I
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
that additional questions Tony Kaplan
 
01:38:35.629 --> 01:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you uh Mr
 
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
manahan for taking my question uh
 
01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
looking forward to seeing the document
 
01:38:41.229 --> 01:38:41.239 align:start position:0%
um just out of curiosity would the
 
01:38:42.910 --> 01:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
amended process that you're suggesting
 
01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
would that be a different
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
membership of the committee or you
 
01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
talking about the same
 
01:38:50.910 --> 01:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
membership uh I we'll leave it would be
 
01:38:53.589 --> 01:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
the same membership and so this proposal
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
is not going to uh involve itself in the
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
membership question whatever I think the
 
01:39:00.350 --> 01:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
view is what that's a totally separate
 
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
thing whatever you'll work out will
 
01:39:04.510 --> 01:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
comply with except for the observations
 
01:39:09.070 --> 01:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
I made before about the um uh the
 
01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
outsized role of the
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
Pu oversized
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
role representative McGee thank you Mr
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr Monahan um so on
 
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
the question of the language clarifying
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
the langu around the substantial
 
01:39:24.239 --> 01:39:26.109 align:start position:0%
the langu around the substantial
aspect

01:39:26.109 --> 01:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
aspect
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh have folks considered defining like
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
Criterion for what what would be
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
substantial I mean because we're talking
 
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
about a substantial change right yeah
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
well what we looked at and so what we
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
didn't say is you know if you convert a
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
solar facility to a nuclear power plant
 
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
is that you know we didn't look at that
 
01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
issue but it was the three things that
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
looked at were uh the footprint you know
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
are you right uh the investment yep in
 
01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
the name plate capacity and then it just
 
01:39:56.109 --> 01:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
became is it if it's in the same
 
01:39:58.030 --> 01:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
footprint I don't remember what it was
 
01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
and you know it's it's uh no greater
 
01:40:03.629 --> 01:40:03.639 align:start position:0%
than 50% of the existing facility I
 
01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
think was what we played around with and
 
01:40:07.589 --> 01:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
then with regard to the investment piece
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's a little trickier um because some
 
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
facilities are you know more Capital
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
intensive but well I guess what I'm
 
01:40:17.310 --> 01:40:17.320 align:start position:0%
wondering is if we're stuck on trying to
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
figure out a monetary you know uh
 
01:40:20.239 --> 01:40:22.350 align:start position:0%
figure out a monetary you know uh
definition

01:40:22.350 --> 01:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
is it sufficient to say the footprint
 
01:40:27.629 --> 01:40:27.639 align:start position:0%
and the name plate stay the same no
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
that's not sub there not a substantial
 
01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
change right I think so particularly if
 
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
it's a merchant you know if it's an
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
unregulated in investment um that
 
01:40:40.270 --> 01:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
probably that's good guidance that those
 
01:40:42.109 --> 01:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
are the it's really two things rather
 
01:40:45.310 --> 01:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
things and I did forget to mention I was
 
01:40:50.070 --> 01:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
thinking maybe on back to the membership
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
um maybe if required a member of the
 
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
Hollis New Hampshire zoning board to be
 
01:40:59.790 --> 01:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
SEC okay so I I will prepare something
 
01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
by the end of the week and share it with
 
01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
you and as many of the people behind me
 
01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
but I'll make sure that staff or uh for
 
01:41:10.750 --> 01:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
the committee gets it as well all right
 
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
before I let you go I'd like you to
 
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
answer one more question if you would
 
01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
and that is we touched briefly this
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
morning on the the possibility the
 
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
desirability of reducing the size of the
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
SEC from its current nine members to
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
five potentially do you have an opinion
 
01:41:33.709 --> 01:41:33.719 align:start position:0%
about that possible change this is my
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
opinion and I haven't talked to the
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
folks at NEPA yet um I think as a
 
01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:39.320 align:start position:0%
general matter they've they've
 
01:41:42.270 --> 01:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
particular with House Bill 69 last year
 
01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
they avoided weighing in on that um so
 
01:41:48.189 --> 01:41:48.199 align:start position:0%
um I think you know if you get the right
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
five or the right nine uh will work with
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
whatever you have um but I think a
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
smaller um body um particularly if it's
 
01:41:59.350 --> 01:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
weighted more on land use expertise then
 
01:42:01.149 --> 01:42:01.159 align:start position:0%
regulatory expertise or financial
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
expertise would be the way to go but I
 
01:42:05.310 --> 01:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
honestly I think at this point I would
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
be very surprised if nepco weighs in um
 
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
on that matter there are other people
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
who are kind of shepherding that
 
01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:13.790 align:start position:0%
who are kind of shepherding that
component

01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
component
 
01:42:16.990 --> 01:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
through okay great thank you oh
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you Mr
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
chairman I had one other question
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
question there had been some discussion
 
01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
about changing the threshold for uh for
 
01:42:32.109 --> 01:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
the name plate capacity that triggers
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
SEC uh currently it's 30 in 30 megawatts
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
in many cases and I I believe there had
 
01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
been discussion about changing it to 50
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
or something like that do you have an
 
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
opinion on that I think there's a
 
01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
proposal at one point to take it up to
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
100 um and I think that's the the 30
 
01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
seems to work um
 
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
uh and what I think is important though
 
01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
is that you keep the flexibility that
 
01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
exists so that the decision can be made
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
to either bring it to the site of
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
valuation committee or go through local
 
01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
planning zoning a lot of it depends on
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
where you're doing it one of the
 
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
projects I worked on was in Fitz
 
01:43:10.830 --> 01:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
Williams New Hampshire 30 megawatt solar
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
solar project and um uh the that
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
Community didn't have the internal
 
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
expertise to handle with everything you
 
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
know the part-time fire chief uh and
 
01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
things like that and so uh I certainly
 
01:43:24.990 --> 01:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to see it bigger U but in
 
01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
any regard I think the flexibility for
 
01:43:28.350 --> 01:43:28.360 align:start position:0%
the applicant to decide where the best
 
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
important okay one more question from
 
01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
follow up on that the experience I've
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
had is this a lot of the towns they see
 
01:43:42.270 --> 01:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
something that's 25 megawatts they just
 
01:43:43.709 --> 01:43:43.719 align:start position:0%
don't they don't want any part of it
 
01:43:45.709 --> 01:43:45.719 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the uh people to
 
01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
work with it and they much prefer to
 
01:43:49.470 --> 01:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
push it over to the SEC so we want to
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:58.030 --> 01:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
right all right thank you Mr Monahan so
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who is in
 
01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:02.679 align:start position:0%
attendance here this afternoon or this
 
01:44:04.990 --> 01:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
morning who has listened to this
 
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
discussion and has a burning desire to
 
01:44:13.189 --> 01:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
add to it if you do Miss Hatfield please
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
perspective thank you very much uh
 
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
Meredith Hatfield for The Nature
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
Conservancy um thanks for the
 
01:44:27.709 --> 01:44:27.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to you today get as
 
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
close to the mic as you can please sure
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
sorry about that um firstly it would be
 
01:44:34.350 --> 01:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
really helpful to get a copy of um what
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
folks have referred to as the gets
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
proposal so we could uh respond to it um
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
a smaller
 
01:44:44.910 --> 01:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
SEC with access to the expertise that it
 
01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
needs does sound like it could um be a
 
01:44:50.669 --> 01:44:50.679 align:start position:0%
solution so um happy to hear the the
 
01:44:53.229 --> 01:44:53.239 align:start position:0%
discussion going in that direction I'm
 
01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
also happy to hear the um
 
01:44:58.510 --> 01:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement that this is largely um
 
01:45:03.629 --> 01:45:03.639 align:start position:0%
thank you largely a land use um
 
01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
decision and we think it's very
 
01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
important for Dees to be at the table in
 
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
a decision-making role and wanted to
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
point to one other topic that came up um
 
01:45:18.430 --> 01:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
on the sighting panel discussion that
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
was at the DuPont energy Summit related
 
01:45:23.589 --> 01:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
to the fact that Dees has many
 
01:45:26.669 --> 01:45:26.679 align:start position:0%
adjudicative um bodies attached to Dees
 
01:45:28.510 --> 01:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
that deal with things like citing of
 
01:45:30.990 --> 01:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
landfills for example through the waste
 
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
Council um they hear appeals of Dees
 
01:45:35.470 --> 01:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
permits so just wanted to mention that
 
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
there is really um significant expertise
 
01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
at Dees around um adjudicative decision-
 
01:45:44.589 --> 01:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
making with assistance from the
 
01:45:46.510 --> 01:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
Justice a couple things I'll just speak
 
01:45:52.109 --> 01:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
to briefly I'm not sure if they're in um
 
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
the gets proposal but wanted to
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
reiterate our strong desire to maintain
 
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
a very rigorous level of public
 
01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:02.310 align:start position:0%
a very rigorous level of public
involvement

01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
01:46:04.510 --> 01:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities also that the council for
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
the public be retained it's a very
 
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
important role that that we have seen in
 
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
many cases be useful to to all of the
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
parties as well as the decision makers
 
01:46:18.030 --> 01:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
also in our testimony on 609 um we
 
01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
pointed out that we think it's very
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
important that the SEC is required to
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
deliberate in public and currently the
 
01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
Pu has an exemption from that for for
 
01:46:30.430 --> 01:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
good reasons but that the SEC duties and
 
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
decision- making should continue um to
 
01:46:36.510 --> 01:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
require uh public
 
01:46:38.669 --> 01:46:38.679 align:start position:0%
deliberations in terms of the size
 
01:46:40.589 --> 01:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
change that has been discussed that
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative Corman asked about we've
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
heard informally
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
from uh small smaller renewable
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
developers that they actually try to
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
size their projects below 30 so that
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
they can just work with the town and not
 
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
have to go to the SEC so I think before
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
considering changing that threshold it
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
might be helpful to reach out to some
 
01:47:04.589 --> 01:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
developers to hear from them
 
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
directly and then lastly in terms of
 
01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
policy direction to the
 
01:47:12.589 --> 01:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
Pu I just wanted to share with the
 
01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
committee that um we are currently a
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
party in the Energy Efficiency uh
 
01:47:21.310 --> 01:47:21.320 align:start position:0%
trienal program review and despite the
 
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
very clear Direction you've given to the
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
Pu in House Bill 549 and Senate Bill 113
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
the process um is kind of unraveling and
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh we've had I believe
 
01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
88 U information requests from the
 
01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
commission to the utilities um which is
 
01:47:41.629 --> 01:47:41.639 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
unprecedented and uh requests for legal
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
briefs so that docket um is proving to
 
01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
be quite challenging despite the clear
 
01:47:52.109 --> 01:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
Direction um that you gave to the
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
commission and the parties and the
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
limits on the commission's review that
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
you've created including funding levels
 
01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
and things like that so we may be back
 
01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
on that but I just want to flag that
 
01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
that the more clarity that you can
 
01:48:07.870 --> 01:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
provide in terms of policy Direction um
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
the better hopefully the sighting
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
processes will work thank
 
01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions for Miss
 
01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
Hatfield okay seeing none is there
 
01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else who would like to uh
 
01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
morning representative Harrington yeah
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
one thing that came up in the
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
discussions of these various uh
 
01:48:36.589 --> 01:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
committees or commissions on This was um
 
01:48:39.149 --> 01:48:39.159 align:start position:0%
the concept of One-Stop shop and that's
 
01:48:40.669 --> 01:48:40.679 align:start position:0%
been discussed and kicked around a lot
 
01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
in other words you go to the site
 
01:48:44.109 --> 01:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee and they would have
 
01:48:47.310 --> 01:48:47.320 align:start position:0%
the basically the authority to do
 
01:48:49.870 --> 01:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
whatever and the the problem is I just
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
don't think I think that's worked I've
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
had extensive discussions with
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott on this and if for
 
01:48:57.669 --> 01:48:57.679 align:start position:0%
example if there's an air permit being
 
01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
issued the air permit the dees issues is
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
issued under the authority of the United
 
01:49:04.350 --> 01:49:04.360 align:start position:0%
States government not the state of New
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the EPA has delegated that
 
01:49:09.629 --> 01:49:09.639 align:start position:0%
authority to uh Dees in New Hampshire so
 
01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
they have to follow the federal rules
 
01:49:14.270 --> 01:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
and regulations on that and you know
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee simply can't
 
01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
come in and say well we don't think you
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
really need to do that in this case so
 
01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
we going to overrule the the permit
 
01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
because it would they'd be overruling
 
01:49:25.390 --> 01:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
Federal EPA which is not going to happen
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
so I just want people to be aware of
 
01:49:28.830 --> 01:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
that there is a provision in the
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
existing 609 that addresses this and
 
01:49:34.589 --> 01:49:34.599 align:start position:0%
basically says if it intends to impose
 
01:49:35.950 --> 01:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
certificate conditions that are
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
different than those imposed by state
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
agencies having permanent or other
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority the commissioner
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
shall promptly notify the agency in
 
01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
writing seek confirmation that such
 
01:49:47.229 --> 01:49:47.239 align:start position:0%
conditions or rulings are in Conformity
 
01:49:48.910 --> 01:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
with the law and regulations applicable
 
01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
to the project in State whether the
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
conditions or rulings are appropriate in
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
light of the agency's statutory
 
01:49:58.430 --> 01:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um and it really stop
 
01:50:00.990 --> 01:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
you there that language was added to
 
01:50:04.669 --> 01:50:04.679 align:start position:0%
hb281 okay so that new language is in
 
01:50:06.669 --> 01:50:06.679 align:start position:0%
statute okay but it's just my my my
 
01:50:08.910 --> 01:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
thing is it doesn't say what happens
 
01:50:11.550 --> 01:50:11.560 align:start position:0%
there's no conclusion I've notified you
 
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
you come back and say as Dees I don't
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
think you can do that because of this
 
01:50:18.109 --> 01:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
reason and that reason and then it
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that I must go along with
 
01:50:24.189 --> 01:50:24.199 align:start position:0%
you or yes the new language at 281 says
 
01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
okay says that the the agency permit
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
prevails okay was not clear in okay all
 
01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
right so based on what I've heard this
 
01:50:37.709 --> 01:50:37.719 align:start position:0%
morning in this discussion which was an
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
excellent discussion great
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
questions uh it seems to me that moving
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
forward on HB 609 we have three definite
 
01:50:49.629 --> 01:50:49.639 align:start position:0%
possibilities one is to change the role
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
of the SEC
 
01:50:54.430 --> 01:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
administrator to allow that position to
 
01:50:55.950 --> 01:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
float with the
 
01:50:59.669 --> 01:50:59.679 align:start position:0%
Pu make that position part of the Pu and
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
Float between the Pu and the SEC that
 
01:51:05.950 --> 01:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
seems like a good change to
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
make number two the possibility of a
 
01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
special track for reuse of existing
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
sites also seems like a strong
 
01:51:18.750 --> 01:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
possibility for addition to an amended
 
01:51:22.750 --> 01:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
HB 609 that incl modifications as well
 
01:51:25.229 --> 01:51:25.239 align:start position:0%
power and then the Third change would be
 
01:51:27.790 --> 01:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
to Define substantial
 
01:51:29.709 --> 01:51:29.719 align:start position:0%
change in
 
01:51:34.669 --> 01:51:34.679 align:start position:0%
statute um those seem like definites to
 
01:51:38.709 --> 01:51:38.719 align:start position:0%
me with regard to an an HB 609 what was
 
01:51:41.790 --> 01:51:41.800 align:start position:0%
the third change the definition of
 
01:51:44.910 --> 01:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
substantial change
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
clarify does anybody do any members of
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee disagree with that
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
assessment are you in agreement that
 
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
those three changes might go forward
 
01:51:58.030 --> 01:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
representative Kook yeah I agree those
 
01:52:00.510 --> 01:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
changes make sense uh on the last one
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
however I'm concerned that you know do
 
01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
we have the expertise to make that kind
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
of change the definition I think with
 
01:52:11.709 --> 01:52:11.719 align:start position:0%
the resources we have available to us Mr
 
01:52:14.189 --> 01:52:14.199 align:start position:0%
Monahan Mr Gs I think we can we can
 
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
probably come up with something yes
 
01:52:17.709 --> 01:52:17.719 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah just to
 
01:52:21.189 --> 01:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
to re get to back to it's so wide open
 
01:52:23.069 --> 01:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
now that it can be interpreted any way
 
01:52:25.069 --> 01:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
anyone wants to there's absolutely no
 
01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
guidance whatsoever uh what about did
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
you mention size of the committee going
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of talk about going from
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
nine to five and I was about to okay so
 
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
I've identified three
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
definites and then there's one
 
01:52:42.750 --> 01:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
possibility and that is to um reduce the
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
size of the
 
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
SEC does there do other committee
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
members have an appetite to do that I
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
know I do
 
01:52:52.750 --> 01:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to hear what other people
 
01:52:55.149 --> 01:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
have to say about the possibility of
 
01:52:57.629 --> 01:52:57.639 align:start position:0%
reducing the size of the committee in in
 
01:52:59.950 --> 01:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh in an amendment representative McGee
 
01:53:01.990 --> 01:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
yep I would I would just say I'm I'm
 
01:53:05.310 --> 01:53:05.320 align:start position:0%
amendable to lowering the number I think
 
01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
it's been established that when we need
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
input from various agencies they're
 
01:53:11.709 --> 01:53:11.719 align:start position:0%
brought in anyway so we don't have to
 
01:53:13.629 --> 01:53:13.639 align:start position:0%
call them out and require them to come
 
01:53:15.149 --> 01:53:15.159 align:start position:0%
to the meeting so that they are part of
 
01:53:18.270 --> 01:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
a quorum so that's fine with me I think
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
the um important changes that we wanted
 
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
to be mindful of was that uh there is
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
still a significant desire to have a
 
01:53:29.189 --> 01:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
member of the public represented and I
 
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
brought up the idea of maybe combining a
 
01:53:33.629 --> 01:53:33.639 align:start position:0%
member of the public that also has land
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
use expertise as a requirement and
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
statute so that we have somebody on the
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
committee that can speak to those issues
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
um and bring that expertise to the board
 
01:53:48.430 --> 01:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
itself um so I think I think five would
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
be five was workable I don't know what
 
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
you are envisioning as those five being
 
01:53:56.709 --> 01:53:56.719 align:start position:0%
but we can discuss that as well well the
 
01:53:59.229 --> 01:53:59.239 align:start position:0%
gets proposal mentioned the three puc
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners the commissioner of thees
 
01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
and then a fifth person I think we as we
 
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier might be a member of
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
the public with some kind of expertise
 
01:54:13.149 --> 01:54:13.159 align:start position:0%
either adjudicative expertise or land
 
01:54:15.550 --> 01:54:15.560 align:start position:0%
use planning expertise or both maybe if
 
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
we could find someone representative
 
01:54:20.350 --> 01:54:20.360 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman uh looking
 
01:54:22.229 --> 01:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
at the gets proposal there is one thing
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
that concerns me here which is uh that a
 
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
quorum is three members of the committee
 
01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
and therefore the puc could be a quorum
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be important for a
 
01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
quorum to contain at least one person
 
01:54:35.790 --> 01:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
not on the
 
01:54:47.310 --> 01:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
down and I think while we're on that
 
01:54:52.030 --> 01:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
topic the other point that was made that
 
01:54:55.069 --> 01:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
I think is of interest is that currently
 
01:54:57.310 --> 01:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
the the um SEC doesn't have any
 
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
requirement for running public meetings
 
01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
and I think most of our other
 
01:55:05.950 --> 01:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
important meetings that involve the
 
01:55:08.189 --> 01:55:08.199 align:start position:0%
public are done in public so I think
 
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
that would be another thing that we
 
01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
should probably put into the statute
 
01:55:13.390 --> 01:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for them not to be
 
01:55:17.470 --> 01:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
actually the the the SEC does there is
 
01:55:19.709 --> 01:55:19.719 align:start position:0%
in statute a requirement that the SEC
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
does have to deliberate in public the PC
 
01:55:25.510 --> 01:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
does not but the SEC does so we would
 
01:55:28.510 --> 01:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
not change that the existing statute we
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
actually um we are actually not allowed
 
01:55:33.390 --> 01:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
to have any meaningful discussions about
 
01:55:35.669 --> 01:55:35.679 align:start position:0%
anything without a quorum present in a
 
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
publicly announced meeting and the the
 
01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
requirement is we have to announce it 24
 
01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
hours in advance I always do it way
 
01:55:43.870 --> 01:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
longer than that um but it has to be
 
01:55:46.270 --> 01:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
public and there has to be a forum so
 
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
even when I am trying to coordinate
 
01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
things via email
 
01:55:53.790 --> 01:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
I can't have a big CC conversation
 
01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
because if they reply to each other yes
 
01:55:58.350 --> 01:55:58.360 align:start position:0%
that could theoretically constitute nonu
 
01:56:02.350 --> 01:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
delation yep it's all okay thanks for
 
01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:03.069 align:start position:0%
delation yep it's all okay thanks for
that

01:56:03.069 --> 01:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
clarification good representative
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah as far as the size issue
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
goes if we're going to improve the
 
01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
efficiency of the committee I think it's
 
01:56:12.910 --> 01:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
it's very imperative that we cut down
 
01:56:15.229 --> 01:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
the size nine is just too many people to
 
01:56:17.550 --> 01:56:17.560 align:start position:0%
get there together and then if you say
 
01:56:19.069 --> 01:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
that you get into the problem with nine
 
01:56:21.310 --> 01:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
so you can have a quorum of five but you
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
could have a quorum of five one day and
 
01:56:25.790 --> 01:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
then a month later there's a quorum of
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
five but three of them are different
 
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
people that weren't at the other meeting
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
and so you have to get that size down uh
 
01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
the other thing is I don't think as was
 
01:56:35.790 --> 01:56:35.800 align:start position:0%
stated by commissioner Elms I don't
 
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
think the department of energy should be
 
01:56:39.709 --> 01:56:39.719 align:start position:0%
on the committee because they have that
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's the thing we tried to do with the
 
01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
reorganization was to get the advocacy
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
role and the deciding role away from
 
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
being working for the same people so
 
01:56:50.229 --> 01:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
whoever was at advocating for the
 
01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:51.719 align:start position:0%
Department of energy on a particular
 
01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
position in front of the committee would
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
then be advocating to their boss so I
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
think they should be out um I certainly
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
could see uh Dees being there and I like
 
01:57:03.669 --> 01:57:03.679 align:start position:0%
I say I just don't I don't understand
 
01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
the the big desire to have a public
 
01:57:07.109 --> 01:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
member there is we don't do that on any
 
01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
other licensing board in the state that
 
01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of or permitting facility but
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh that's not a huge issue I guess but
 
01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
definitely getting the size
 
01:57:20.030 --> 01:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
down that's why I think a public me
 
01:57:22.030 --> 01:57:22.040 align:start position:0%
member would need to have some special
 
01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
expertise to offer in order to be able
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
to make a valuable contribution to this
 
01:57:29.310 --> 01:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
process so either
 
01:57:32.069 --> 01:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
adjudicative expertise or land use
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
planning expertise or both if we could
 
01:57:37.229 --> 01:57:37.239 align:start position:0%
if we could find it would be useful
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you uh one
 
01:57:41.669 --> 01:57:41.679 align:start position:0%
thing I would add was during the
 
01:57:45.550 --> 01:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
testimony uh a few months ago we heard a
 
01:57:48.149 --> 01:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of support for a member of the
 
01:57:50.709 --> 01:57:50.719 align:start position:0%
public on the SE
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
DC representative
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah I concur I think it's
 
01:57:56.830 --> 01:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
important to have a member of the public
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
there um I also want to agree with
 
01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I think uh
 
01:58:02.830 --> 01:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
having the department of energy as a as
 
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
a member of the of this committee might
 
01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
be uh in overlap with the Pu and their
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
adjudicative functions I think what
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
we're missing uh is um a voice for the
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
public interest and so therefore I think
 
01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
that someone from the Department of
 
01:58:18.149 --> 01:58:18.159 align:start position:0%
Justice might be you know might be a
 
01:58:20.069 --> 01:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
valuable addition as the member of the
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
five yeah we discussed that earlier
 
01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
before you arrived and uh we're guarded
 
01:58:28.069 --> 01:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
there already is a member of the
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice that's involved in
 
01:58:33.069 --> 01:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
the process to the public Council so
 
01:58:36.990 --> 01:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
having one of the Commissioners be from
 
01:58:40.109 --> 01:58:40.119 align:start position:0%
the doj would actually interfere with
 
01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
the uh with the process all right so
 
01:58:46.109 --> 01:58:46.119 align:start position:0%
next step is or the next question is
 
01:58:47.709 --> 01:58:47.719 align:start position:0%
what is our next
 
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
step it seems to me that we might want
 
01:58:53.629 --> 01:58:53.639 align:start position:0%
to meet one more time with this
 
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to evaluate maybe a
 
01:59:00.589 --> 01:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
concrete proposal so I would be willing
 
01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:03.679 align:start position:0%
to to take the lead in coming up with a
 
01:59:03.679 --> 01:59:05.229 align:start position:0%
to to take the lead in coming up with a
concrete

01:59:05.229 --> 01:59:05.239 align:start position:0%
concrete
 
01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh that includes the three definites
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
that we want here which is change the
 
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
role of the SEC
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
admin create a special special track and
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
I can work with Mr Monahan to do that
 
01:59:25.709 --> 01:59:25.719 align:start position:0%
and then Define substantial change and
 
01:59:28.950 --> 01:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
I'll work with Mr Gs and Monahan to see
 
01:59:31.950 --> 01:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
if we can we can do that I'll also take
 
01:59:36.510 --> 01:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
a a shot at uh redefining the roles of
 
01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh or the members of the SEC reducing it
 
01:59:42.270 --> 01:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
from from 9 to
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
five having
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
four uh state employees and one public
 
01:59:51.069 --> 01:59:51.079 align:start position:0%
member and require some special
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
expertise from the public member I'll
 
01:59:55.270 --> 01:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
take a shot at putting all that together
 
01:59:57.910 --> 01:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
we we will convene once again and go
 
02:00:00.149 --> 02:00:00.159 align:start position:0%
over that proposal and if it looks good
 
02:00:01.870 --> 02:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
we'll vote on it and go
 
02:00:04.990 --> 02:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
forward sound reasonable all right so
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
then the question becomes when shall we
 
02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
meet so next
 
02:00:16.669 --> 02:00:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
10th extend days okay how about if we
 
02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.950 --> 02:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
17th so you won't be here for the 17th
 
02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:33.189 align:start position:0%
17th so you won't be here for the 17th
either

02:00:33.189 --> 02:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:35.669 --> 02:00:35.679 align:start position:0%

consideration we do have a meeting

I'm wondering if could piggyback them
rather

02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
rather
 
02:01:24.149 --> 02:01:24.159 align:start position:0%
than being up here two days for I don't
 
02:01:25.629 --> 02:01:25.639 align:start position:0%
know if that makes sense what time is
 
02:01:27.229 --> 02:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
the meeting on the 16th uh they're all
 
02:01:28.990 --> 02:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
at 10: so I believe it's a morning
 
02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
meeting the meeting in the
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
16 you have to ask me that it's a
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting it is I think 159
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
and and I think there's a 558
 
02:01:41.149 --> 02:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting in the afternoon oh
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%

02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
so at one yeah oh okay all right so
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%

02:01:49.870 --> 02:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
could squeeze it in that's fine what day
 
02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
