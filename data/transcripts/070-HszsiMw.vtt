Muse OTP seconded by representative
 
00:29:05.789 --> 00:29:05.799 align:start position:0%
Murray representative would you like to
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion uh yes um briefly
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
in most parts of the country including
 
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh there is no ability uh
 
00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
to voluntarily add yourself to the
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
federal firearms background check system
 
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do is change that
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
by establishing uh voluntary uh do not
 
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
sell list uh in the state of New
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for people who wish to
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
volunteer L wave their firearms rights
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
um I think we heard uh uh some emotional
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
and and poignant testimony uh during the
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
public hearing for this bill um I also
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
don't think we heard uh any uh any
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
serious uh objections to this uh from a
 
00:29:53.549 --> 00:29:53.559 align:start position:0%
Libertarian standpoint this is
 
00:29:57.389 --> 00:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
essentially what this bill uh would do
 
00:30:01.149 --> 00:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
is the most Libertarian thing ever um it
 
00:30:02.909 --> 00:30:02.919 align:start position:0%
basically gives people control over
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
their own destiny uh it lets them make
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
the choice uh and this is vitally
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
important uh for people uh who suffer
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
from episodic mental illness uh around
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh things like severe depression uh
 
00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:21.519 align:start position:0%
bipolar uh uh bipolar illnesses and
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
things of that nature who may be totally
 
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
in control of themselves at one point um
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
and then not so much uh at a at a
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
different point in time what what this
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
essentially allows them to do is to take
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
the most lethal potential form of
 
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
suicide off the table but only for
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
themselves uh and what it also allows
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
them to do at a point where they would
 
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:45.559 align:start position:0%
they feel better would they feel more
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
confident in their abilities where they
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
feel like their um their mental health
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
has improved significantly they can get
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
themselves off the list um so uh bottom
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
line uh this is a bill that actually um
 
00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
uh increases uh freedom for some people
 
00:31:07.629 --> 00:31:07.639 align:start position:0%
and the ability to make uh a choice that
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
they that they want to make on a
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
voluntary basis so I would urge you to
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh to pass it thank
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Murray
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your
 
00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
second um I would just affirm what
 
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative Muse said and that if
 
00:31:27.629 --> 00:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
people are looking for a way to protect
 
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
themselves from themselves we should
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
give them the ability to do so thank you
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
and I'll start discussion by saying that
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
I I think I can speak for the minority
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
present today that that first blush this
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
seemed like a a good bill to me it
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
seemed um it seemed to make
 
00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:52.039 align:start position:0%
sense but during the testimony um I
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
particularly was taken aback by the um
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
testimony from the New Hampshire Medical
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
Association when they testified that
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
they liked it because it helped um their
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
their to further the end that they
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
testified was their goal was to um
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
obtain lists of people that own firearms
 
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
and I found that rather
 
00:32:18.629 --> 00:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
disturbing um and I also some of the
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard was concerning with
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
regard to potential to influence people
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
to put their names on this list um when
 
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
that may may not necessarily be what
 
00:32:31.389 --> 00:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
they want I realized that the bill has
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
some guard rails against that but they
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
would be probably
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
um um very difficult to enforce if
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
someone's doctor said you need to put
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
your name on this list if you want to be
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
continued to be treated by me or things
 
00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
of that nature so um for that reason I
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
think that we would not support it um
 
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.430 align:start position:0%
think that we would not support it um
further

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:56.519 align:start position:0%
discussion representa Stone thank you Mr
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh I'd like to say that
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
this bill uh is a red flag bill it also
 
00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:04.519 align:start position:0%
uh creates a penalty for an individual
 
00:33:06.509 --> 00:33:06.519 align:start position:0%
who is voluntarily doing something which
 
00:33:08.909 --> 00:33:08.919 align:start position:0%
is kind of uh disturbing in itself in
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill uh furthermore
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
I I really think it uh creating a
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
registry even voluntarily is a slippery
 
00:33:19.149 --> 00:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
slope when providing your personal
 
00:33:21.149 --> 00:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
information to any government entity and
 
00:33:24.269 --> 00:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
it may uh have unnecessary consequences
 
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
in the future if that information
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
happens to be retained and there is no
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
statutory time frames of which requires
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
an individual to submit to have their
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
name off the list of which that would
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
occur those are some of the points that
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
I just uh picked up out of it that are
 
00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:38.919 align:start position:0%
most concerning to
 
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
me thank you further
 
00:33:44.629 --> 00:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
discussion represent wheeler thank you
 
00:33:44.639 --> 00:33:45.590 align:start position:0%
discussion represent wheeler thank you
Mr

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
chairman I I appreciate your concerns
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
and the concerns brought by Mr Stone and
 
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
I Shar the concern about coercion I I
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
was worried about that when I heard that
 
00:33:58.509 --> 00:33:58.519 align:start position:0%
in the public public hearing as well but
 
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
I do think that representative Muse has
 
00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
crafted uh legislation which was
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully put through with the right
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
guard rails in place and and I think
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
that um you know in my reading about uh
 
00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
this program as it's been implemented in
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
Utah and Virginia and Washington um and
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
the program as it's being proposed in
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
other states it seems to be working and
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
it seems to be uh working in an
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
efficient way where people aren't being
 
00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
coursed onto the list and and where uh
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
this information is being kept private
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
from from people who might uh use it for
 
00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
malicious means and it is being used to
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
to help people
 
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
from going out and harming themselves
 
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
when they know that when they the
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
individual know that they shouldn't uh
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
have a weapon so uh I share your
 
00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
hesitations Mr chairman um as you know I
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
have different opinions than the the
 
00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:00.680 align:start position:0%
rest of my team on this but I also I
 
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:03.079 align:start position:0%
think that this is uh a bill that that's
 
00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:04.599 align:start position:0%
worth supporting and I and I'll be
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
voting uh for a to pass on this
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you further
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
discussion see none oh representative

on House Bill

on House Bill
1186

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
1186
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
and we'll be making a motion
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative Newman I recognize you
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
for a motion make the motion to itl I
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
don't believe this bill is necessary I
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
think that Merchants should label things
 
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
any way they want to label them I also
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
think that the penalty is excessive
 
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
$10,000 for reach occurrence I don't
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
know whether that's each occurrence on
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
the bill or whatever it is I just think
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
that this bill is
 
00:37:18.079 --> 00:37:21.230 align:start position:0%
that this bill is
unnecessary

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
second second seconded by representative
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%

00:37:32.829 --> 00:37:32.839 align:start position:0%
didn't he would you like to speak to
 
00:37:32.839 --> 00:37:35.710 align:start position:0%
didn't he would you like to speak to
your

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
second discussion representative
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
jaman thank you Mr chairman uh it's
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that the uh credit card
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
companies and the bankers Association
 
00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
sat with me crafted a Amendment to the
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
$110,000 um and makes the person liable
 
00:37:59.950 --> 00:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
for that uh any penalty would be the
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
credit card uh transaction company and
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
not the credit card companies or the
 
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
banks um and if you don't think this
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
bill is necessary I will point to the
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
state of California where this morning
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
CBS News reported that they will be
 
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.470 align:start position:0%
CBS News reported that they will be
using

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
um fire and purchasing codes and that
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
financial institutions are required by
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
State LA in California
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
to share that information with the state
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
police so if you don't think this is uh
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
necessary in a Live Free Die Live Free
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
or Die State I think you're sadly
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
mistaken thank you I would um I'd add to
 
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
that that I would ask the members to
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
think what if it wasn't about Firearms
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
what if it was um a red State and the
 
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
governor was getting information from a
 
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
company that was tracking um for example
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
purchases made by by lgbtq people or
 
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
trans people um to to find out who was
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
getting operations and contrary to what
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
they wanted or any number of things the
 
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
government using private companies to
 
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
further its ends is is nefarious it's a
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
horrible practice to start and I think
 
00:39:20.109 --> 00:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
that we need to keep a very very close
 
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
eye on that because the Big Brother
 
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
state is here and when you can't make a
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
purchase with without the government
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
knowing it and keeping track of it that
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
that's problematic as you can see what
 
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
has happened here in our state with our
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
um medical marijuana
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
programs they're all Cash and Carry
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
because um the government's keeping an
 
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
eye and will shut down any bank that
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
processes any of that so it's it's a
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
like I said it's a very slippery slope
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
when the government's Mand watching what
 
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.910 align:start position:0%
when the government's Mand watching what
we're

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
buying representative Stone thank you Mr
 
00:39:56.109 --> 00:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
chair in regards to this bill if you
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
believe that an individual's right to
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
privacy outweighs anyone else's rights
 
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes to tracking your
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
information even your buying habits you
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
would support having this bill ought to
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
pass in addition uh I think the chairman
 
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
hit it right on the head is where do we
 
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
go if it's just gun rights is it going
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
to be transgenders is it going to be
 
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
other issues that come up and evolve I
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
think this is a problematic bill and I
 
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
think it uh has issues where we need our
 
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
privacy protected if we look at the New
 
00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution specifically
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
section to article B government
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
intrusion is there for a reason and
 
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
again I would urge everybody to uh vote
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on this bill and not
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
itl just to clarify you weren't saying
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
the Bill's problematic but the
 
00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
Situation's problematic the situation is
 
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
highly problematic where you're tracking
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
individual's rights to what they
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
purchase and the government has no right
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
to know what you're buying and and
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
further your point we just not just we
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
but the people of the state just adopted
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
a constitutional amend
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
to be have privacy in their effects and
 
00:41:02.589 --> 00:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
their information from the government
 
00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
and the government is using a back door
 
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
to get it around that Amendment
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
represent wheeler thank you Mr chairman
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
I agree with what you said I don't think
 
00:41:16.109 --> 00:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
it is a uh far-fetched idea nor is it
 
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
far-fetched to say that the government
 
00:41:20.829 --> 00:41:20.839 align:start position:0%
right now has
 
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
become uh excessive in how much it is
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
willing to to trample on people's
 
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
privacy rights uh we saw from the
 
00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
Wikileaks documents and Edward Snowden
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
and other Chelsea Manning and other
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
whistleblowers that have come out to
 
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
discuss some of the things that the
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
military and intelligence agencies have
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
done when it comes to
 
00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
extrajudicial uh surveillance on the
 
00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:53.240 align:start position:0%
American public and I'm very concerned
 
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
it's not a a q andon conspiracy at all
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
to say that the government is moving
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
forward on this it's a Well documented
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
and established fact and as I think you
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
articulated very well Mr chairman this
 
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
could be used you know take guns away it
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
could be used for any number of things
 
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
tracking people's behavior and when we
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
live in a state in which we have passed
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
a constitutional amendment affirming
 
00:42:22.349 --> 00:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
people's right to privacy and when we
 
00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
say that people are individuals and have
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
their individual right
 
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
to have their uh transactions private
 
00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
then I I think that this is a
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
legislation worth supporting I think
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative jamron has put in a lot
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
of diligent work working with people who
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
are going to be affected by this and and
 
00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:44.559 align:start position:0%
I I uh uh will be voting against the itl
 
00:42:46.589 --> 00:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
motion uh in hopes that we can bring
 
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
forward the amendment that he has
 
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
brought forward and and uh that another
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
motion can be
 
00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
made thank you for the
 
00:42:59.950 --> 00:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
use so basically what these codes would
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
do would be to allow the banks and the
 
00:43:09.069 --> 00:43:09.079 align:start position:0%
credit card companies to to basically
 
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
support uh suspicious and potentially
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
illegal activity uh so a lot of credit
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
cards have uh have pretty high limits um
 
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
one of the things that might flag uh the
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
interest of of uh of the company might
 
00:43:28.549 --> 00:43:28.559 align:start position:0%
be a purchase of let's say
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
$20,000 uh worth of firearms and
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
ammunition all made at the same time um
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
I think that there's uh one of the
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
things I think we also need to recognize
 
00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
is that um uh while there have been
 
00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
states that have pass laws that um uh
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
that would not allow that would
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
essentially disallow credit card
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
companies and Banks from gathering this
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
information um the credit card companies
 
00:43:56.589 --> 00:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
themselves have uh
 
00:44:00.549 --> 00:44:00.559 align:start position:0%
suspended uh there have have essentially
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
um suspended this policy uh the policy
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
right now is under review uh there's
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
also an effort uh at the national level
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh to take a look at this and to put
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
additional guard rails around the
 
00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
practice one of the things I will say
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
that that's also danger is creating a a
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
patchwork of different state laws so New
 
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does it one way Virginia does
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
it slightly differently California does
 
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
something completely different what it
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
does is it is it adds significantly to
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know to the cost uh for the you
 
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
know for uh for some of these companies
 
00:44:45.069 --> 00:44:45.079 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of um you know
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh something like this is
 
00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
you know is is good public policy um I
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
don't think there's really any evidence
 
00:44:56.349 --> 00:44:56.359 align:start position:0%
that any of this information would
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
actually be used to put together any
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
kind of registry or anything like that
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
um I mean essentially it's in in in a
 
00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
lot of ways it's not very different uh
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
from what social media companies do when
 
00:45:14.829 --> 00:45:14.839 align:start position:0%
they see a uh uh like a
 
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
particularly um
 
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh you know I guess a particularly
 
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
crazy post uh from from an individual
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
that might indicate what an that that
 
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
individual is doing harm um lawn uh
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
social media companies uh are you know
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
will cooperate with law enforcement and
 
00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
situations like that um I'm not I'm not
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
seeing uh the potential uh uh for uh the
 
00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:46.839 align:start position:0%
kind of abuse that would lead you to
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
think that law-abiding gun owners are
 
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
going to be targeted uh for simply
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
purchasing another box of ammunition uh
 
00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:57.559 align:start position:0%
for their hand gun uh purchasing another
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
rifle for hunting I I don't see a
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
situation like that um and I think one
 
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
of the things that we need to do is try
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
as best we can to actually make laws
 
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
that respond to actual problems uh and I
 
00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
don't think this is an actual problem
 
00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.030 align:start position:0%
don't think this is an actual problem
thank

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
you thank you um I I found it
 
00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:19.640 align:start position:0%
interesting you said that it was a law
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
that might be used to track illegal
 
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
activity and then you said such as
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps purchasing 20 $1,000 worth of
 
00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:29.240 align:start position:0%
firearms or ammunition one rifle can
 
00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.190 align:start position:0%
firearms or ammunition one rifle can
cost

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:33.079 align:start position:0%
$20,000 and that's highly legal and it's
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
frankly none of the government's
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
business um or if I bought 10 of those
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
until it's illegal it's my it's my right
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that the government
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
should be able to track my rights
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative Stone thank you Mr chair
 
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to point out that uh anybody
 
00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
that holds a credit card has the option
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
much like in 1050 of voluntarily setting
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
limits to set to be flagged if your
 
00:46:55.549 --> 00:46:55.559 align:start position:0%
credit card is being used in excess of
 
00:46:57.549 --> 00:46:57.559 align:start position:0%
either 5 three or whatever denomination
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
you want to set in addition uh we
 
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
already have laws in effect that if uh
 
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
firearm purchases are very legal such as
 
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
straw purchases they're address both at
 
00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:08.079 align:start position:0%
the federal level which has a high
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
degree of
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh imprisonment and high fines attached
 
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
to it uh I just I think this is an
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
invasion of privacy and I know in the
 
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
past I've worked with entities in my
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
employment post 911 where a lot of
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
information was gained through
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
financials whether it' be bill paying or
 
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
it be uh other purchases that you could
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
get subpoenaed records on to help build
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
a case if you so desired to so there are
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
avenues that have been in existence of
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
tracking information and this just adds
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
to it and codifies it where we're
 
00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:39.079 align:start position:0%
justifying tracking people's individual
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
violated members of the committee before
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry before chairman
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
Roy calls on the next person if you
 
00:47:52.349 --> 00:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
could all please silence your phones
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
your computers whatever you have open
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
we're we're hearing a lot of dinging and
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
and it's it's it's quite disrespectful
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
so please turn your your your ringers
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
you representative Stone um you have a
 
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.990 align:start position:0%
you representative Stone um you have a
huh

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
huh
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
oh jam I'm sorry representative jamron
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
you um you had mentioned what your
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
amendment was going to
 
00:48:38.349 --> 00:48:38.359 align:start position:0%
do if it did it did it um address any of
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
the concerns we've
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
heard uh actually uh when representative
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
Newman had made his motion he had
 
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned a $10,000 fine uh the
 
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
amendment strikes that $10,000 fine and
 
00:48:54.789 --> 00:48:54.799 align:start position:0%
leaves the Civil penalty up to the uh
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
Court of appropriate jurisdiction to
 
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
determine that any other changes to the
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
bill other than that uh it changed so
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
that the um person that would be liable
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
for prosecution or this is not the
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
issuer of the card but the card
 
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
processing Network that's the two
 
00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
Balden um I was just curious if the
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor or anyone on the committee could
 
00:49:27.309 --> 00:49:27.319 align:start position:0%
speak to how this would impact
 
00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:29.030 align:start position:0%
preventing acts of
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:32.150 align:start position:0%
preventing acts of
[Music]

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.870 align:start position:0%
[Music]
terrorism

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
terrorism
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
um I I don't understand the question
 
00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
maybe you could clarify it how how would
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
it How would how would it be involved in
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
terrorism terrorists use weapons and if
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
they purchase them so on a credit
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
card then law enforcement might be aware
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
I guess that question presupposes that
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
everyone who buys a firearm should be
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
screened for
 
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
terrorism what was there a threshold
 
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
that that you think that they should be
 
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
able to see I don't know I'm not I'm not
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
in the FBI but I wonder if it would make
 
00:50:16.829 --> 00:50:16.839 align:start position:0%
it difficult for them to if this isn't
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
if this coding isn't a tool in their
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
toolbx I I would suggest that uh I will
 
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
a second represent Pro um I would
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
suggest that the government already
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
knows via um when a firearm is
 
00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
purchased um from an FFL
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
dealer they have a track of every weapon
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
they sell so they know that these
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
weapons are being sold and reports are
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
made to the um to the federal government
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
from the FFL dealer of their sales so
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
and the F ATF can walk in any time and
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
see the list of all the sales they made
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
and they have to be provided so there's
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
already a the ability to to see it but
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
they have to have a they have to have a
 
00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:01.559 align:start position:0%
reasonable cause to think there's a
 
00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:03.799 align:start position:0%
crime they can't just screen everybody
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
and say well that one might be criminal
 
00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
or that one might be criminal
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative PR did you want to add to
 
00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
that well I would like to say
 
00:51:14.589 --> 00:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
that I don't know any terrorist or
 
00:51:17.069 --> 00:51:17.079 align:start position:0%
criminal for the most part that uses a
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
credit card to buy their weapons they're
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
usually Black Market weapons that have
 
00:51:22.349 --> 00:51:22.359 align:start position:0%
been stolen
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
already um so they can't be traced back
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
so they're not using credit
 
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
cards and as I continue on this usually
 
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
most transactions over $10,000
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
automatically get flagged to the
 
00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:38.839 align:start position:0%
government so if you're spending
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
$220,000 on anything it gets flagged or
 
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
$10,000 And1 or actually
 
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.670 align:start position:0%
$10,000 And1 or actually
10,000

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
10,000
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
um and to representative M uh social
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
media yeah they may point it out to the
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
government but it's that post is already
 
00:51:59.549 --> 00:51:59.559 align:start position:0%
in the public so you're not reaching
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
into their their secret private stuff
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
it's they already put it out there and
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
somebody just says hey did you see this
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
so I think that's a little bit different
 
00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
than me using my credit card and my
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
company telling the government
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
everything that I'm
 
00:52:19.789 --> 00:52:19.799 align:start position:0%
buying good points um who's
 
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
left represent
 
00:52:26.349 --> 00:52:26.359 align:start position:0%
Pratt I was oh I was going to speak to
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
an earlier statement about list um if
 
00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
you're put on a list if you use your
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
credit card to buy marijuana legally in
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that'll put you that could
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
possibly put you on a list uh right now
 
00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:38.200 align:start position:0%
federally it's against the law now
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
you're on a list so just to keep you in
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
mind as the list start getting built by
 
00:52:45.549 --> 00:52:45.559 align:start position:0%
what you buy on a credit card it can be
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
used for
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
everything I would um I believe you
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
can't use a credit card in New Hampshire
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
can you no but I think in Massachusetts
 
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
you might be able to at the dis at their
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
open no as far as I know it's a Cash and
 
00:53:01.789 --> 00:53:01.799 align:start position:0%
Carry business because of the federal
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
Jamber thank you Mr chairman uh I did
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
want to point out I did mention
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
California this morning um so I'll
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
clarify what I meant by that um the
 
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
reason that the credit card companies
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
paused this policy uh when it was
 
00:53:23.309 --> 00:53:23.319 align:start position:0%
announced in
 
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
2022 um there was such push back and
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
several States passed laws outlawing it
 
00:53:32.109 --> 00:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
much like this bill would do um and
 
00:53:33.549 --> 00:53:33.559 align:start position:0%
those was passed and were signed into
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
law those seven states are the states
 
00:53:38.829 --> 00:53:38.839 align:start position:0%
that stopped the credit cards from uh
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
companies from doing this that's why the
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
policy was suspended so that they would
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
have time to either work through the
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
federal government to make it a federal
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh mandate or uh to prohibit it
 
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the states um there is a
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
patchwork now I the the California it's
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
literally it was on uh on my way here
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
Sor on CBS Newsfeed California requires
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
this to be used and they also require
 
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
the agencies that use the credit cards
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
and and make this list to share that
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Justice in
 
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
California um again we live in the live
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
Frei State not the whatever they call
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
themselves over there I call them the
 
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
Left Coast so I'm I'm trying to be
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
polite about it but the reason that it
 
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
was suspend
 
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
is because several States voted to
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
prohibit the use the only state that is
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
mandated mandated that it be used is
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
California representative
 
00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
scitech has anybody noticed when
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
somebody says I'm not going to repeat
 
00:54:44.589 --> 00:54:44.599 align:start position:0%
previous arguments then they go and
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
repeat all those previous arguments well
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to do that the obvious
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
thing that we've I've not ever heard it
 
00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the entire discussion you
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
take take your card go down get cash and
 
00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
go back and buy it on a cash basis
 
00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
what's is any nobody's even mentioned
 
00:55:05.309 --> 00:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
that as far as I know see I would I'd
 
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
happy to respond to that I've bought
 
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
numerous firearms and I buy them online
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and they don't take cash
 
00:55:14.829 --> 00:55:14.839 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh when you do that you
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
give them your credit card they take the
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
firearm you purchase they send it to an
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
FFL in your state you go to the state
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
FFL they do the background check and
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
then they give you the firearm there's
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
no way to give them cash so that would
 
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
Balon going back to the earlier topic of
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
terrorism it's my understanding that the
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
9911 hijackers did use credit cards in
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
part to fund their activities and it
 
00:55:51.789 --> 00:55:51.799 align:start position:0%
this does seem like it could create some
 
00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
problems for federal law enforcement to
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
be able to prevent
 
00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:57.910 align:start position:0%
be able to prevent
terrorist

00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
terrorist
 
00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:00.559 align:start position:0%
Behavior yeah they they um I think they
 
00:56:02.349 --> 00:56:02.359 align:start position:0%
used the credit cards to buy plane
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
tickets and perhaps box cutters but they
 
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:07.640 align:start position:0%
didn't use Firearms represent wheeler
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would also just
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
like to say um because profiling has
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
brought up so much in this committee
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
that I would caution us to use the
 
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
arguments about terrorism just because
 
00:56:21.029 --> 00:56:21.039 align:start position:0%
anybody can be a terrorist as we've seen
 
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
in the mass shootings and what we've
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
seen recently any anybody could be a
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
terrorist you could look like anything
 
00:56:28.349 --> 00:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
and act like anything and I think as you
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
said it gets into dangerous territory
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
where if we start discussing things like
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
that as is being discussed in the NSA
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
and other domestic intelligence agencies
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
then we start getting into a situation
 
00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
where we're screening every gun owner
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
who wants to purchase a gun for
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
terrorism and that gets into privacy
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
concerns as well representative Stone
 
00:56:51.029 --> 00:56:51.039 align:start position:0%
thank you and to respond to
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative scitec most uh your too
 
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
popular day for gun buying is usually
 
00:56:58.029 --> 00:56:58.039 align:start position:0%
weekends and ATMs limit the amount of
 
00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
cash you can get out of an ATM so $500
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
is not a big threshold for a new firearm
 
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
today if you haven't bought one recently
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
maybe you could get a high
 
00:57:09.309 --> 00:57:09.319 align:start position:0%
point which which reviews are actually
 
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
pretty good on high points um they are
 
00:57:15.029 --> 00:57:15.039 align:start position:0%
oddl looking Firearms represent Murray
 
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um yeah this
 
00:57:20.109 --> 00:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
discussion is enlightened me a little
 
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
bit and I think um I entered this
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
understanding that the data wasn't going
 
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:27.039 align:start position:0%
anywhere and we've heard differently um
 
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
based on this conversation I do want to
 
00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:33.640 align:start position:0%
say that um lgbtq issues have been named
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
a couple times and um from my
 
00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
understanding many of the people in this
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee voted against a bill that we
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
had before us on the floor to protect
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
people who come here to the state to get
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
lgbtq surgeries and I believe that um
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
from getting subpoena from other states
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
that they come from um that have made
 
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
laws against those surgeries and and so
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
I think I would just ask like if I join
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
you in this that you be consistent in
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
that logic and um protect people trans
 
00:58:05.309 --> 00:58:05.319 align:start position:0%
people in the future who are getting
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
persecuted for having surgeries and that
 
00:58:11.309 --> 00:58:11.319 align:start position:0%
kind of uh uh those kind of expenses
 
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
being tracked by the government I would
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
happily sign as a co-art today about
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
anyone getting information about
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
purchases used for lgbtq or or frankly
 
00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
abortion or anything
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
it's we can debate policy all day long
 
00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:31.640 align:start position:0%
but when we let the government get into
 
00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
um taking over that for us we can no
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
longer debate that policy because it's
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
set for us by mandate um represent
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
Balden are we going to terrorist
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
again I'm pretty sure you could take
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
more than $500 out of an ATM I've done
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
that recently but if we're all in
 
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
agreement on the things that we don't
 
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
want um tracked in these purchases can
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
we pause amend the bill to include l
 
00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
related to abortion and LGBT issues and
 
00:58:58.990 --> 00:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
then pass the
 
00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
bill um it's not your main I believe it
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
is we'd have to get a ruling but um it's
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
an early bill so we got to take care of
 
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
it today um I am going to call a um I am
 
00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:13.720 align:start position:0%
going to call a um brief re recess
 
00:59:17.549 --> 00:59:17.559 align:start position:0%
because somebody wanted to caucus um yes
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
and uh we'll take this up again in a
 
00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:23.630 align:start position:0%
and uh we'll take this up again in a
couple

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.640 --> 01:23:37.390 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
okay I'm reopening the executive session
 
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
1186 and when last we
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
spoke um there was some discussion
 
01:23:55.149 --> 01:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
about moving forward um I was did anyone
 
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
want to add anything
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
else okay um the motion on the floor is
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate I believe and
 
01:24:07.870 --> 01:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
um I'd ask the court to call the role
 
01:24:11.550 --> 01:24:11.560 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman the amendment number is 202
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
24-6 4H would you like to speak to your
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
motion absolutely the amendment that you
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
received a copy of this morning uh was
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
have the request of the New Hampshire
 
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
Bankers Association and the uh folks
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
that represent the credit card companies
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh to the legislature um they came to me
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
I believe it was Friday with a bunch of
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
textual uh changes that they wanted that
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
they wanted to work with and what we've
 
01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
done is under the Farms code we've
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
changed it to category 5723 which is
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
what the international organization or
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
standardization came up with uh and we
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
also made the issue
 
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
of uh penalty for the payment card
 
01:25:57.870 --> 01:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
Network it's not specifically a credit
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
card or the banks that are doing this
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's the the transmitter of the
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
transaction um and the second change
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
that this would make is under the
 
01:26:11.709 --> 01:26:11.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement um it would uh place it
 
01:26:15.149 --> 01:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
before a court of um jurisdiction that
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
has jurisdiction over it that they can
 
01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
seek an injunction and they may also
 
01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
recover a civil penalty at the
 
01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:25.400 align:start position:0%
discretion of the court so there's no uh
 
01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:26.350 align:start position:0%
discretion of the court so there's no uh
blank

01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
blank
 
01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
$10,000 fine um or penalty I'm sorry
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
it's not a fine it be a penalty so those
 
01:26:33.310 --> 01:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
are the two changes that are in this
 
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
year uh you'll notice that the change
 
01:26:38.669 --> 01:26:38.679 align:start position:0%
from the original Bill to this one adds
 
01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
the payment card Network as a chapter so
 
01:26:44.189 --> 01:26:44.199 align:start position:0%
that it can be utilized further in the
 
01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh section thank you repres Stone would
 
01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to you a second Mr
 
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
chair I'd like to add that I think these
 
01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
uh changes to the original Amendment
 
01:26:54.310 --> 01:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
is actually something that's going to be
 
01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
beneficial and I can support
 
01:26:59.669 --> 01:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
fully thank you um I'll start discussion
 
01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
by asking a question when you talk about
 
01:27:03.629 --> 01:27:03.639 align:start position:0%
processor you're talking about um
 
01:27:06.669 --> 01:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
companies like for example square or uh
 
01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
some kind of a merchant processing
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
system where they actually are a go
 
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
between between the retailer and the um
 
01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
the bank is that correct yes Mr chairman
 
01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
the if you go into a Walmart today um
 
01:27:21.310 --> 01:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
the credit card terminal that's there is
 
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
actually using the network and there's I
 
01:27:26.669 --> 01:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
believe seven or eight different ones
 
01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
Nationwide um and it could be any of
 
01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
those those are actually the companies
 
01:27:33.310 --> 01:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
that assign the uh commercial code for
 
01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
that terminal so yes thank you um and
 
01:27:40.990 --> 01:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
one last
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
question you spoke to I believe the
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
company was American Express um were
 
01:27:48.910 --> 01:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
they um against this spill or were they
 
01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
happy to comply once you made the
 
01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
changes Mr chairman they took no
 
01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
position in the bill they just requested
 
01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
that the language be changed to be a
 
01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
little bit more succinct thank you
 
01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
amendment seeing none of ask CL oh sorry
 
01:28:06.910 --> 01:28:06.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative Murphy sorry
 
01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um I my question is whether or
 
01:28:12.109 --> 01:28:12.119 align:start position:0%
not the fiscal note that attached to the
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
original Bill still applies that it said
 
01:28:16.270 --> 01:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
that methodology requires the Attorney
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
General to conduct investigations and
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
the estimated cost for the two positions
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
is about $90,000 per year is that is
 
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
that still applicable or does the
 
01:28:26.910 --> 01:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
amendment change that representative I
 
01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:29.560 align:start position:0%
would actually um counter with the fact
 
01:28:32.189 --> 01:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
that that representative Muse said uh
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
right now they've suspended the use of
 
01:28:36.669 --> 01:28:36.679 align:start position:0%
this code Nationwide with the exception
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
of California they're required it by
 
01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
under statute and the reason they did
 
01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
that is because the several States had
 
01:28:46.510 --> 01:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
made it illegal because it has been um
 
01:28:49.109 --> 01:28:49.119 align:start position:0%
paused if we come in with this bill and
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
it passes and is signed into law the the
 
01:28:53.109 --> 01:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
credit card companies and the
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
transmitters have no intention of
 
01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
utilizing that code in the state of New
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so the $90,000 that was quoted
 
01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note we don't anticipate
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be any expense
 
01:29:04.109 --> 01:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
because they will voluntarily comply
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
with that and that was the consensus I
 
01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
got from them this morning when I spoke
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
to him in the hall thank you so to be
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
clear the cost would be zero as long as
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
the credit card processors comply with
 
01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:17.590 align:start position:0%
the credit card processors comply with
the

01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
law that's correct and they they have
 
01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
indicated they voluntarily will will be
 
01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
uh adhering to the law and and should
 
01:29:29.109 --> 01:29:29.119 align:start position:0%
they not um does this not allow for them
 
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
to be assessed a civil penalty that
 
01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
could be used to reimburse the Attorney
 
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
General's office for their expenses
 
01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
at um in the amendment line 36 the
 
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
Attorney General May recover reasonable
 
01:29:49.109 --> 01:29:49.119 align:start position:0%
attorney fees and other reasonable
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
expenses incurred in the investigation
 
01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
so that $90,000
 
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
effectively would go away yes thank you
 
01:29:57.629 --> 01:29:57.639 align:start position:0%

and thank you very much for the
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity repr Stone would you like to
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
speak to your second Mr chairman I
 
01:31:11.470 --> 01:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
concur that we've had a lengthy
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
discussion I'm all
 
01:31:15.629 --> 01:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
set agreed I I don't think anything's
 
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
change so unless someone wants to add
 
01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
something further that we haven't
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
already discussed representative
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
Newman I voted for the amendment because
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
it makes this bill a better bill I still
 
01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
think it's a bad Bill I think it's
 
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary I think that we're involving
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General to look after
 
01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:35.800 align:start position:0%
people that are just designating
 
01:31:38.669 --> 01:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
merchandise is actually what was sold
 
01:31:40.030 --> 01:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
and that there's no need to it this
 
01:31:42.189 --> 01:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't mandate anything at all it just
 
01:31:44.350 --> 01:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
does not prohibit them from doing what
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
they feel they ought to be doing I don't
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
know maybe it has to do with merchandise
 
01:31:51.550 --> 01:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
uh restocking or whatever but I think
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
that the Mandate is a really mandate
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
that they can't do what they want to do
 
01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:02.189 --> 01:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
bill I would um I would respond by
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
saying it's a mandate that they don't
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
share my private transactions with the
 
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
government and that's what the Mandate
 
01:32:09.870 --> 01:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
is represent Stone thank you Mr chair
 
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
I'd like to point out that uh we're
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
interacting with processing companies
 
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
they hire pretty highend attorneys that
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
help uh keep their their funds where
 
01:32:20.189 --> 01:32:20.199 align:start position:0%
they belong in the profit margins and
 
01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
once a state would make a policy like
 
01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
this they will adhere to it so that they
 
01:32:26.189 --> 01:32:26.199 align:start position:0%
do not pay out additional funds to
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%

their abuser from accessing deadly

changes to RSA
 
01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
173-b a statute intentionally written to
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%

work that needed to be changing in the
 
01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
bill and I think uh removing anything
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
from the 173b section of rsas is
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
problematic and that's why I would be

01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
report today please with that I close
 
01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
the executive session I hereby open in
 
01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
the executive session
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
1339 I recognize representative Stone to
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
introduce an
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
has this bill has actually been amended
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
in a form that that's extremely
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
different from uh the original Bill uh
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
the original Bill uh
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh essentially would have uh e extended
 
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
the role of the New Hampshire State
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
Police in doing Federal in in doing uh
 
01:36:31.149 --> 01:36:31.159 align:start position:0%
firearms background checks uh to long
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
guns as well as handguns uh what this
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it it essentially
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
changes the process for returning of
 
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
firearms after restraining orders um my
 
01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
issue is not necessarily with the
 
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative Stone has
 
01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
created um my issue is more uh one of
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
process my understanding is that this
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
issue was brought to the attention of
 
01:36:59.950 --> 01:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
the chair uh last week one one of the
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
consequences of doing it this way is uh
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
because this is the equivalent of a
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
brand new bill it has never really had a
 
01:37:09.550 --> 01:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
public hearing uh it's not really
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
Germain there may have been people who
 
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
would have liked to have testified on
 
01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
this bill one way or the other uh who
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
were not able to do so because it was
 
01:37:21.870 --> 01:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
never really identified like that so um
 
01:37:23.310 --> 01:37:23.320 align:start position:0%
I know that we're in a little bit of a
 
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
pickle uh with with early bills but I do
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
think that this is something that from a
 
01:37:30.510 --> 01:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
from a process perspective we do need to
 
01:37:33.149 --> 01:37:33.159 align:start position:0%
pay attention to things like
 
01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative Stone would you like to
 
01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
address the gerous issue on this please
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
I would Mr chairman uh this amendment is
 
01:37:45.629 --> 01:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
uh under Amendment uh 0
 
01:37:49.390 --> 01:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
605h and it does it is Germain to The
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
Heading it puts a lot of the uh
 
01:37:53.790 --> 01:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility on the New Hampshire gun
 
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
line which is administered by the New
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Safety which uh
 
01:37:59.709 --> 01:37:59.719 align:start position:0%
they have significant role in and
 
01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
therefore I feel that this bill fixes
 
01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
some issues we've heard with other bills
 
01:38:05.709 --> 01:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
that were brought before us
 
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
previously in addition uh it also
 
01:38:10.109 --> 01:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
addresses some of the issues that was
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
identified in 1337 as being problematic
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
for its uh change in language for
 
01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
173b this bill was properly noticed as a
 
01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and the public was noticed
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
to appr uh to show up and we actually
 
01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much had a public hearing where
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
we heard the concerns of both the New
 
01:38:28.109 --> 01:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Safety and from
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence Coalition and I
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
believe uh Chief Goldstein spoke on
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
behalf it's either the New Hampshire
 
01:38:35.709 --> 01:38:35.719 align:start position:0%
Chiefs of Police Association or the New
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Police Officers Association
 
01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
and when you had the amendment drafted
 
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
did uh OS indicate to you in any way
 
01:38:43.589 --> 01:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
that this was a non-gain Amendment they
 
01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
did not thank you um representative Muse
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
your your objection is noted um and you
 
01:38:53.669 --> 01:38:53.679 align:start position:0%
are are uh free obviously to um speak to
 
01:38:55.589 --> 01:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
the the clerk and the speaker after and
 
01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
if they so rule then um I guess the bill
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
will go into nowhere land I'm not sure
 
01:39:04.109 --> 01:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
what happens to it at that point um with
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
that I in I um introduce your Amendment
 
01:39:10.030 --> 01:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
please actually you have to need a
 
01:39:11.709 --> 01:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
second on
 
01:39:15.070 --> 01:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
it second second of Representative
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
janen would you like to speak to your
 
01:39:19.870 --> 01:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
motion yeah I'd like to clarify that uh
 
01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
this motion uh excuse me this amendment
 
01:39:24.430 --> 01:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
basically changes the word after
 
01:39:26.109 --> 01:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
speaking with the Department of Safety
 
01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
in which they felt that they could work
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
with the parameters of uh May versus
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
shell which was the only real change
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
from the what I referred to as MCU
 
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that was initially put forward
 
01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
at the subcommittee and I believe the
 
01:39:42.990 --> 01:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
domestic Coalition was uh had no issues
 
01:39:44.589 --> 01:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
with the way the bill was written and
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
basically this bill adds time frames for
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
the judicial aspect of uh returning your
 
01:39:52.030 --> 01:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
Firearms does not negate any background
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
checks but actually sets forth that the
 
01:39:56.109 --> 01:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
court would have approximately 10
 
01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
business days to schedule one and it
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
also get a response from the Nicks line
 
01:40:01.629 --> 01:40:01.639 align:start position:0%
which is administered by the Department
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
of Safety Division of State
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
Police thank you would you like to speak
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
to your second representative
 
01:40:11.229 --> 01:40:11.239 align:start position:0%
Jam I concur with his comments and I
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
defer representative um if you could for
 
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
um mine and the rest of the committee's
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
um education um walk me through what
 
01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
this actually means mechanically as far
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
as someone has a an order in their um
 
01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
weapons are seized Mr chair I'm going to
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
use the example of a just a restraining
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
order that it's expired upon expiration
 
01:40:36.189 --> 01:40:36.199 align:start position:0%
there is no paperwork that's generated
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
it just gets out of the system it shows
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's expired and it's no longer valid an
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
individual who's previously prohibited
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
from purchasing a firearm or possessing
 
01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
a firearm can actually go as soon as the
 
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
order is expired and buy a new firearm
 
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
however that individual cannot simply
 
01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
show up at the police department and say
 
01:40:54.109 --> 01:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
I'd like my my firearms return to me
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
that you seized uh they would have to be
 
01:40:59.550 --> 01:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
doing a motion with the court previously
 
01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
there was no time frames the court could
 
01:41:03.149 --> 01:41:03.159 align:start position:0%
determine it on their schedule this
 
01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
would provide guard Wills of 10 days uh
 
01:41:07.589 --> 01:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
once the uh order is given the next
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
background check would be initiated by
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
the request of the Court it would then
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
be approved by the judge all parties
 
01:41:17.589 --> 01:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
obviously would be noticed that have uh
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
invested into the hearing and at that
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
point the judge would make a
 
01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
determination to direct the law
 
01:41:24.510 --> 01:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency that seized the guns
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
to return the Firearms basically the
 
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
premise is uh the co-sponsor uh
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative Manion brings out if the
 
01:41:32.589 --> 01:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
orders are are done by a court to take
 
01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
Firearms then it needs to be an order
 
01:41:37.070 --> 01:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
given to return the Firearms which gives
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
most law enforcement agencies a
 
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable feeling knowing that they
 
01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:42.639 align:start position:0%
have a document they can have that says
 
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
I was or we were ordered to return
 
01:41:46.189 --> 01:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
firearms and put in their file either
 
01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
electronically or in a hard
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
copy thank you so basically basically
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
distilled down what this does is it it
 
01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
stops the process whereby someone has a
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
restraining order against them the order
 
01:42:00.109 --> 01:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
expires they're free to go buy all the
 
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
Firearms they wanted to store but in
 
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
order to get their own firearms back to
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
reased they had to go to court and go
 
01:42:07.629 --> 01:42:07.639 align:start position:0%
through an a process that could cost
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
them more money in time just to get the
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
Firearms back this alleviates that Mr
 
01:42:14.109 --> 01:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
chair it does and another thing this
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
also does is the state does not want to
 
01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
be holding on the responsibility of
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
anyone's property if there's no
 
01:42:22.589 --> 01:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
legitimate legal reason to do so and
 
01:42:24.669 --> 01:42:24.679 align:start position:0%
most agencies I spoken to in regards to
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
this issue are accepting of this because
 
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
they want to get these items out of
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
their evidence rooms as well and if
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
there's no legal basis for the state to
 
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
be holding something they shouldn't be
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
inuring that liability either and what
 
01:42:39.149 --> 01:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
what if any push back was there after
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
you amended it was there any push back
 
01:42:42.910 --> 01:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
after you had it finally in its final
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
form I believe all the uh shareholders
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
that were here during this process were
 
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
pretty confident with the language as it
 
01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679 align:start position:0%
was amended thank you further discussion
 
01:42:53.470 --> 01:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
oh representative um
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
rhods thank you Mr chairman if if I may
 
01:42:58.470 --> 01:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
ask uh a question of Representative
 
01:43:03.629 --> 01:43:03.639 align:start position:0%
Stone go ahead and could you just um my
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
my question is is was the coal was the
 
01:43:07.950 --> 01:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Coalition were they here
 
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
for your subcommittee and if they were
 
01:43:11.629 --> 01:43:11.639 align:start position:0%
could you just give us uh some feedback
 
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
if they spoke to at the bill they were
 
01:43:15.629 --> 01:43:15.639 align:start position:0%
and I hope I met all their concerns
 
01:43:17.229 --> 01:43:17.239 align:start position:0%
their biggest concern was the fact of
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
not having background checks done I
 
01:43:20.910 --> 01:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
think that was satisfied and I'm not
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
sure if she's still here or not but she
 
01:43:25.350 --> 01:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
was here for the subcommittee and their
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
big concern was making sure that there
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
was in fact a next background check
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
conducted before issuing the Firearms
 
01:43:33.870 --> 01:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
back by the court and as I advised her
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
as I did many that usually the court of
 
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that has authority over
 
01:43:40.149 --> 01:43:40.159 align:start position:0%
this is usually the court that issued
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
the orders for domestic in the case of
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
173b so they will have the file and in a
 
01:43:46.270 --> 01:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
course of regular business as we all
 
01:43:48.589 --> 01:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
know uh most of the communities they
 
01:43:50.910 --> 01:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
have frequent flyers same individuals
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
they know who they're dealing with they
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
also have access to the New Hampshire
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
Court database whether it be superior
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
court or it be uh Circuit Court they
 
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
have all the information they need it
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
just gives them a next step to use the
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
next line to be able to validate there's
 
01:44:05.790 --> 01:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
not an outside order and the reason for
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
the changing the word from Shell provide
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
a response to May is that the state
 
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
police felt it was imperative they'd be
 
01:44:14.709 --> 01:44:14.719 align:start position:0%
able to give a response in the case of
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
State Massachusetts they reach out to a
 
01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts court the Massachusetts
 
01:44:19.149 --> 01:44:19.159 align:start position:0%
court says yeah we'll get right back to
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
you they never hear from them again
 
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
they'd at least be able to produce a
 
01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
letter and document to have a cover
 
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
letter to say look we've done everything
 
01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
we found no prohibitions but we have no
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
response from this say hypothetically
 
01:44:31.629 --> 01:44:31.639 align:start position:0%
the Lynn Massachusetts District Court
 
01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
they never provideers re response but
 
01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
from our end we we don't see any reasons
 
01:44:38.430 --> 01:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
not to return firearms and with regard
 
01:44:41.629 --> 01:44:41.639 align:start position:0%
to that point if um a court in
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts had in fact entered a new
 
01:44:47.229 --> 01:44:47.239 align:start position:0%
restraining order or um a conviction of
 
01:44:48.589 --> 01:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
some type that would show up in the next
 
01:44:50.030 --> 01:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
check anyway is that not true yeah the
 
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
restraining order would be in next and
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
spots representative Newman I just have
 
01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
a question since I I believe this is the
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
first time we've seen this amendment is
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
that correct that's a question for the
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
chair I think other than the
 
01:45:03.870 --> 01:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yeah that's a full-time the
 
01:45:06.270 --> 01:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
full committee Ser it yeah and who and
 
01:45:07.629 --> 01:45:07.639 align:start position:0%
did we get a report from the
 
01:45:09.390 --> 01:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that's a question for the
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
chair I believe that um representative
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
stone is talking about it right now I
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
mean was there a vote taken or I'm just
 
01:45:17.229 --> 01:45:17.239 align:start position:0%
wondering if there there was no vote
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
taken at the subcommittee the the
 
01:45:20.669 --> 01:45:20.679 align:start position:0%
majority consensus was to return to the
 
01:45:22.350 --> 01:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
full committee for the executive session
 
01:45:26.589 --> 01:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
okay and now can I I have a question
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely could you just point out
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
where the change from Sha to May is I
 
01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
see some Shalla knots in there so I see
 
01:45:35.470 --> 01:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
a bunch of shs I'm sorry that would be
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
on line
 
01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
31 on the first
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
page be under 30 prohibited from
 
01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
possessing a firearm within 10 business
 
01:45:45.310 --> 01:45:45.320 align:start position:0%
days of the Court's request the
 
01:45:47.790 --> 01:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
department of safety May provide a
 
01:45:49.589 --> 01:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
proceeded response to the requesting
 
01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
court so previously it was shell which
 
01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
as we know shells you will do it versus
 
01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
May which gives the
 
01:45:58.510 --> 01:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
option a
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
followup and so but I do see there are
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
still several shells in here the court
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
shall not the court shall not be
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
required to request conductor receive
 
01:46:12.910 --> 01:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:15.229 --> 01:46:15.239 align:start position:0%
check draw my question because I want to
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
read that more
 
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
carefully I'm repres Stone there are
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
there are occasions this bill also
 
01:46:24.669 --> 01:46:24.679 align:start position:0%
covers uh issues other than 173b 173b
 
01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
and uh 633 -3 are demestic violence and
 
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
stalking uh there nothing prohibits a
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
police department in other circumstances
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
such as a uh bail condition ending
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's non-domestic related from
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
Firearms being returning but it also
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
seeks out if the individual police
 
01:46:43.629 --> 01:46:43.639 align:start position:0%
department does not want it to go to uh
 
01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
you know if they don't don't want to
 
01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:46.719 align:start position:0%
give the guns up freely they can
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
actually request a court
 
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
action but the protections for for the
 
01:46:52.189 --> 01:46:52.199 align:start position:0%
domestic Coalition was more geared
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
towards the 173b protection and the
 
01:46:59.229 --> 01:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
6333 thank you further
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Murphy thank
 
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question my
 
01:47:09.310 --> 01:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
question was um on page one line 2829
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
can you clarify um how it what uh
 
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances would lead a niy check to
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.350 --> 01:47:20.360 align:start position:0%
inconclusive that would be the examp
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
example I gave of an out of state court
 
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
which refuses to cooperate with New
 
01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then New Hampshire has no
 
01:47:27.589 --> 01:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh they can't force Massachusetts to
 
01:47:30.189 --> 01:47:30.199 align:start position:0%
cooperate and a lot of times uh probably
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
less than I'd say 3% in the Firearms
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
industry do you get a uh a nonresponse
 
01:47:38.669 --> 01:47:38.679 align:start position:0%
back that's been my experience uh I know
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
that generally you either get a denied
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
or an approval pretty quick the delay
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
usually responds for further information
 
01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
inquiries and this is not 100% you know
 
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to definitely get a
 
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
response back especially if you're doing
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
without a States like bigger States like
 
01:47:57.589 --> 01:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
Florida even California an inconclusive
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
is only for saying we're not sure what
 
01:48:00.750 --> 01:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
the classification of crime in the old
 
01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
days in the state of New Hampshire uh
 
01:48:04.669 --> 01:48:04.679 align:start position:0%
domestic violence uh complaints were
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
actually just a red box that was checked
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh since we've evolved you know
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
technology has gone further you may
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
still have some individuals that have to
 
01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
go pull a manual complaint and see if
 
01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
that box was checked or we the bed the
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
complaint to see if it was a domestic
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
that meets the federal requirements
 
01:48:22.030 --> 01:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
under their definition of domestic
 
01:48:25.390 --> 01:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
violence could you clarify though um for
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
I I have a question so when they do the
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
ncks check the the instant background
 
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
check it it's going to come back with it
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't come back with an inconclusive
 
01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
no there's only three statuses it's
 
01:48:39.550 --> 01:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
either approved denied or delayed
 
01:48:41.310 --> 01:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
delayed is usually the one they have to
 
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
clarify if there's a uh say like in the
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
case of a simple assault if you're a
 
01:48:46.669 --> 01:48:46.679 align:start position:0%
simple assault and it's a straightup
 
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
simple assault non-domestic related
 
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
that's not a lifetime prohibition if you
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
have a domestic simple assault and
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
that's codified and shown to be the case
 
01:48:56.709 --> 01:48:56.719 align:start position:0%
then you are a prohibited person so but
 
01:48:59.149 --> 01:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
the delayed doesn't put the onus back on
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
the local police to follow up with other
 
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
courts it's the FBI who has to follow up
 
01:49:05.629 --> 01:49:05.639 align:start position:0%
to to correct is that correct in in the
 
01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
case of the gunline if it's a handgun
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
then they'd be the ones making the phone
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
call right so when you were saying um
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
some courts might not be responsive in
 
01:49:14.229 --> 01:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
Florida or California that would be to
 
01:49:16.270 --> 01:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
the F FBI's inquiry regarding the
 
01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:17.800 align:start position:0%
original record it could also be to the
 
01:49:19.870 --> 01:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Police okay yeah to
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
the Govern online yes okay correct all
 
01:49:24.149 --> 01:49:24.159 align:start position:0%
right further questions
 
01:49:26.270 --> 01:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
or representative
 
01:49:29.950 --> 01:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
n um so I just want to um ask I know
 
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
that these were along the lines of the
 
01:49:33.870 --> 01:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
the concerns that were raised by the
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
Coalition uh the domestic violence
 
01:49:37.470 --> 01:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
Coalition and I'm just wondering since
 
01:49:40.270 --> 01:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
this uh is dated today if the if they've
 
01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
actually looked at the language
 
01:49:44.910 --> 01:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
and yes I provided them with a copy as
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
well as the state police that were
 
01:49:47.950 --> 01:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
represented here today and I wanted to
 
01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that they had no more concerns
 
01:49:55.709 --> 01:49:55.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
you okay see you no further the motion
 
01:50:01.149 --> 01:50:01.159 align:start position:0%
is to adopt the amendment I would ask
 
01:50:02.990 --> 01:50:03.000 align:start position:0%

real briefly Mr chair I'd like to just
 
01:51:17.669 --> 01:51:17.679 align:start position:0%
reaffirm that this does not uh do
 
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
anything but add time frames for the
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
court to assess in the issue out a
 
01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
hearing date the firearm background
 
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
checks are still would be completed as
 
01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:25.910 align:start position:0%
checks are still would be completed as
required

01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:51:27.629 --> 01:51:27.639 align:start position:0%
previously would you like to speak to
 
01:51:30.189 --> 01:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
your second representative Pro
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
negative um for discussion I just want
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
to for the record
 
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
clarify the only thing changed with
 
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
regard to returning Firearms to someone
 
01:51:42.669 --> 01:51:42.679 align:start position:0%
who had a previous protection order
 
01:51:45.030 --> 01:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
against them is that now there's a time
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
frame by which the court must issue an
 
01:51:49.390 --> 01:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
order giving it back whereas before it
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
could take forever ever and they had to
 
01:51:52.430 --> 01:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
go to court and request a motion to
 
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
return them is that correct that is
 
01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
correct it sets a 10day window that they
 
01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
have to hold a
 
01:52:01.229 --> 01:52:01.239 align:start position:0%
hearing thank you further
 
01:52:04.709 --> 01:52:04.719 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
Muse I would say what this bill does is
 
01:52:09.790 --> 01:52:09.800 align:start position:0%
it points out the continued need for
 
01:52:11.790 --> 01:52:11.800 align:start position:0%
people who are in domestic violence
 
01:52:13.629 --> 01:52:13.639 align:start position:0%
situations and who have filed protective
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
orders if they feel that there are
 
01:52:18.629 --> 01:52:18.639 align:start position:0%
circumstances that uh would lead them to
 
01:52:21.390 --> 01:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
try to have those orders uh extended
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
those are things that they're going to
 
01:52:24.910 --> 01:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
need to go to court to do uh and they're
 
01:52:27.310 --> 01:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
going to need to show up to do that I I
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
don't think it's fair to um depend on an
 
01:52:34.430 --> 01:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
inefficiency uh in in the system uh to
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
keep people away from uh uh even things
 
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
like Firearms um that are their property
 
01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:41.709 align:start position:0%
like Firearms um that are their property
um

01:52:41.709 --> 01:52:41.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:45.669 --> 01:52:45.679 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily so what this bill does um
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
as the chair said is it it adds uh some
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
more specific time frames FR it adds
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
some uh some guard rails around the set
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
of circumstances that where the guard
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
rails I think were a little bit
 
01:53:04.149 --> 01:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
ambiguous before um so I'll support
 
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
it thank you for the
 
01:53:08.589 --> 01:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none the motion is
 
01:53:10.189 --> 01:53:10.199 align:start position:0%

would you like to speak to your motion

representative yes Mr chairman thank you
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
um I I understand the the genuine
 
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
concern that the sponsor and the
 
01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor had um with bringing this
 
01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
legislation forward but when we heard
 
01:55:23.599 --> 01:55:24.550 align:start position:0%
legislation forward but when we heard
the

01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
testimony um it seems that this is could
 
01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:30.199 align:start position:0%
cause a well actually will be a huge
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
Invasion to privacy um for for for any
 
01:55:36.830 --> 01:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
patients and it seems to me that if
 
01:55:39.229 --> 01:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
you you know there there are mechanisms
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
in place that if you have a loved one
 
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
that you know you need you feel that you
 
01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
know has medical conditions that you
 
01:55:48.669 --> 01:55:48.679 align:start position:0%
know these situations may arise you are
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
able to get guarded Guardianship and
 
01:55:52.149 --> 01:55:52.159 align:start position:0%
when you have that guardianship then you
 
01:55:54.910 --> 01:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
are able to put this out to the public
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
but to just to just say that somebody's
 
01:55:58.990 --> 01:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
medical information should be shared
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
because you feel that their safety may
 
01:56:03.229 --> 01:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
be in dang you really just can't do that
 
01:56:05.109 --> 01:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
um and additionally we did pass a bill
 
01:56:08.830 --> 01:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
last year that does allow you know
 
01:56:10.350 --> 01:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
there's a a checkbox you know if there's
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
an elderly person that has you know
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
medical conditions maybe they have Al
 
01:56:15.870 --> 01:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's you know this may be
 
01:56:17.709 --> 01:56:17.719 align:start position:0%
something that can be addressed in in
 
01:56:20.470 --> 01:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
that way um but to just basically say
 
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
that you know a person's been in out of
 
01:56:23.069 --> 01:56:23.079 align:start position:0%
the hospital and we want to share that
 
01:56:25.390 --> 01:56:25.400 align:start position:0%
information with the public is is
 
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
something I just don't feel that is
 
01:56:29.470 --> 01:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
right to do represent wheeler would you
 
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your second I think
 
01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
RADS did it
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
perfectly I would um I would say this
 
01:56:38.069 --> 01:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
that I think that the the um intent is
 
01:56:40.709 --> 01:56:40.719 align:start position:0%
laudable um and I think that there may
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
be a way to do it and I think the
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
sponsor should not give up and and come
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
back with a better crafted bill that
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
includes input from all the stakeholders
 
01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:51.719 align:start position:0%
then we might be able to do something
 
01:56:54.229 --> 01:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
but uh it occurred to me you know if
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
that if there is such a database there
 
01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:57.639 align:start position:0%
are departments in the state that don't
 
01:56:59.709 --> 01:56:59.719 align:start position:0%
have mobile data Terminals and if they
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
need to query of dispatch regarding
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
something like this and they don't have
 
01:57:05.310 --> 01:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
a secure Channel they're going to put
 
01:57:06.910 --> 01:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
someone's medical information out over
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
scanner land where people in their homes
 
01:57:10.229 --> 01:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
are going to sit there and listen to and
 
01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
know all about the person's medical
 
01:57:14.589 --> 01:57:14.599 align:start position:0%
history so it needs a lot of work um
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
with that further
 
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:18.560 align:start position:0%

um a similar bill in the Senate um after
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh working on this bill initially with
 
01:58:38.229 --> 01:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
the AG um we found out that the state
 
01:58:40.510 --> 01:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
police is already collecting a lot of
 
01:58:43.069 --> 01:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
this data and we need more time to
 
01:58:45.629 --> 01:58:45.639 align:start position:0%
ensure that the bill is written in a way
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
that um does not conflict with the uh um
 
01:58:51.790 --> 01:58:51.800 align:start position:0%
processes that are already in place um
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%

and I think it's prudent to refer it to
 
01:59:08.910 --> 01:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
a committee to do further
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%

motion to itm is there a second second
 
02:00:31.589 --> 02:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Murphy would
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion
 
02:00:36.109 --> 02:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
representative sure um the as written
 
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
this bill um had some serious flaws um
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
there was the timing was off it was
 
02:00:43.589 --> 02:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
talking about uh from five years from
 
02:00:46.589 --> 02:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
the date of commitment um rather than uh
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
the absolute discharge um there was also
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
Al unclear language in here who is a
 
02:00:51.790 --> 02:00:51.800 align:start position:0%
medical professional there were a
 
02:00:55.069 --> 02:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
variety of of um problems that U that
 
02:00:57.069 --> 02:00:57.079 align:start position:0%
kind of sabotaged the intent of the bill
 
02:00:59.589 --> 02:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
and I think the the comment was made uh
 
02:01:02.109 --> 02:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
in this in this uh as we were talking
 
02:01:05.069 --> 02:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
about it um for you know the authors of
 
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
the bill to bring forward an amendment
 
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh that might fix those problems and
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
okay um would you like to speak to your
 
02:01:25.470 --> 02:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
second representative Murphy yes thank
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
you um I some of the testimony we
 
02:01:30.149 --> 02:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
received was that uh there was concern
 
02:01:32.910 --> 02:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
that um if this information was annulled
 
02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
it would not be available uh for those
 
02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers um use in in
 
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
determining dangerousness Etc so um I uh
 
02:01:44.910 --> 02:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
would support the um
 
02:01:48.550 --> 02:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
I thank you um I would add that um
 
02:01:53.069 --> 02:01:53.079 align:start position:0%
mental Health like any any um disease um
 
02:01:56.030 --> 02:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
Can reoccur at any time sometimes years
 
02:01:58.390 --> 02:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
later and someone may get better for a
 
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
while and without being able to look
 
02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
back on the medical history which may
 
02:02:05.069 --> 02:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
include a commitment um really
 
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
hamstrings a doctor's ability to further
 
02:02:10.470 --> 02:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
treat that person um and the motivation
 
02:02:12.990 --> 02:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
for that is um I I just don't understand
 
02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
it so um with that being said
 
02:02:17.310 --> 02:02:17.320 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you Mr
 
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
chairman um I I think representative
 
02:02:22.030 --> 02:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
Newell and yourself and representative
 
02:02:24.310 --> 02:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
Murphy did a good job at explaining why
 
02:02:26.109 --> 02:02:26.119 align:start position:0%
the itl on this bill is a is a good
 
02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
thing the New Hampshire hospitals came
 
02:02:29.470 --> 02:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
and testified about how it might
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
hamstring their ability
 
02:02:34.589 --> 02:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
to bring consistency of care to a
 
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
patient who comes to the hospital and
 
02:02:38.189 --> 02:02:38.199 align:start position:0%
and I think that's something that should
 
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
be that's a concern and I think as the
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
bill is written it would allow for
 
02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
violent people to get some of their
 
02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
rights back which is also a concern um
 
02:02:50.669 --> 02:02:50.679 align:start position:0%
but I do just want to say for the sake
 
02:02:53.589 --> 02:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
of Representative Reed who who brought
 
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
um really powerful testimony about uh
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
her story that of what she had gone
 
02:03:01.629 --> 02:03:01.639 align:start position:0%
through um with domestic violence and
 
02:03:04.750 --> 02:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
and with other things and and uh having
 
02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
the process that she went through result
 
02:03:09.510 --> 02:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
in her not being able to defend herself
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
I think is a concern and hopefully in
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
the next banum someone is able to bring
 
02:03:16.189 --> 02:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
up legislation which addresses that and
 
02:03:18.310 --> 02:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that people who are no longer
 
02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
in danger to the themselves or others
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
are able to defend themselves in
 
02:03:24.910 --> 02:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
whatever way they see fit as Ellen Reed
 
02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
as representative Reed brought up here
 
02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
committee I do not believe I was here
 
02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
for that testimony um but it sounds like
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
it makes sense based on the short
 
02:03:39.910 --> 02:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
recitation you said I would remind you
 
02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:41.800 align:start position:0%
that um another bill that I and
 
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative Muse are bring in forward
 
02:03:45.390 --> 02:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
allows people to have um their rights
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
restored who may have at one point um
 
02:03:49.629 --> 02:03:49.639 align:start position:0%
not been able to have them which is
 
02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
currently the State of Affairs in New
 
02:03:55.629 --> 02:03:55.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire further discussion represent
 
02:03:59.790 --> 02:03:59.800 align:start position:0%
Muse I just wanted to add that this um I
 
02:04:01.870 --> 02:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
think that this bill is is very well
 
02:04:03.950 --> 02:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
intentioned but what it does is it
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
treads on the same ground as uh as HB
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
1711 and the ATF is very specific around
 
02:04:13.310 --> 02:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
the types of uh programs that will
 
02:04:15.790 --> 02:04:15.800 align:start position:0%
actually certify like this and I think
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
another thing from a mental health
 
02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
perspective is um
 
02:04:22.870 --> 02:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
what 1711 does is it is it looks at
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
unconditional discharge as being uh the
 
02:04:28.270 --> 02:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
proper gate to look at in a situation
 
02:04:30.430 --> 02:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
like this not just necessarily the
 
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
expiration of time because as
 
02:04:35.069 --> 02:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
representative Roy said um mental health
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
can be an ongoing struggle that can last
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
for years and it was also pointed out to
 
02:04:41.549 --> 02:04:41.559 align:start position:0%
us in committee that a person can
 
02:04:43.510 --> 02:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
actually be involuntarily committed for
 
02:04:45.629 --> 02:04:45.639 align:start position:0%
up to 5 Years in New Hampshire so if we
 
02:04:47.950 --> 02:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
have a bill that says that um
 
02:04:50.229 --> 02:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
essentially they can have their firearms
 
02:04:52.069 --> 02:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
back uh at the end of 5 years you could
 
02:04:54.229 --> 02:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
have a person conceivably walking out of
 
02:04:56.350 --> 02:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital one day uh and
 
02:04:58.910 --> 02:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
buying Firearms the next so there are
 
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
there are issues uh with this particular
 
02:05:03.069 --> 02:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
bill that I think are more effectively
 
02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
dealt with in other legislation that's
 
02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:07.430 align:start position:0%
dealt with in other legislation that's
before

02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
us thank you um see you no further
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
discussion the motion on the floor is in
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate I would ask the
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%

Amendment

03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
03:52:10.670 --> 03:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
2024 -
 
03:52:10.680 --> 03:52:12.830 align:start position:0%
2024 -
0618

03:52:12.830 --> 03:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
0618
 
03:52:16.149 --> 03:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
H is there a
 
03:52:18.630 --> 03:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
second second by representative Stone
 
03:52:20.710 --> 03:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
03:52:25.189 --> 03:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
yes I would so this amendment creates a
 
03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
review panel for the Bureau of EMS in
 
03:52:32.990 --> 03:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
the past it's been one
 
03:52:33.000 --> 03:52:35.349 align:start position:0%
the past it's been one
investigator

03:52:35.349 --> 03:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
investigator
 
03:52:39.630 --> 03:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
uh and not necessarily the same level
 
03:52:42.910 --> 03:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
as the person being investigated so you
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
could have an EMT investigating a
 
03:52:47.630 --> 03:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
paramedic and not knowing all the ins
 
03:52:48.830 --> 03:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
and out of
 
03:52:51.229 --> 03:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
paramedicine uh and I've have seen that
 
03:52:54.630 --> 03:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
personally happen um so this creates a
 
03:52:57.750 --> 03:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
three member board uh of the same level
 
03:52:57.760 --> 03:52:58.630 align:start position:0%
three member board uh of the same level
or

03:52:58.630 --> 03:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:53:02.429 --> 03:53:02.439 align:start position:0%
higher to
 
03:53:05.670 --> 03:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh take the information make a
 
03:53:09.349 --> 03:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
determination in the past it has been uh
 
03:53:12.189 --> 03:53:12.199 align:start position:0%
the investigator gave the information
 
03:53:15.510 --> 03:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
to uh the commissioner of safety who is
 
03:53:16.670 --> 03:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
a police
 
03:53:20.790 --> 03:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
officer who has no EMS experience making
 
03:53:23.269 --> 03:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
these decisions so I think in all
 
03:53:25.349 --> 03:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
fairness the person making these
 
03:53:29.110 --> 03:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
decisions should be their peers same
 
03:53:33.550 --> 03:53:33.560 align:start position:0%
level or higher three of them looking at
 
03:53:36.870 --> 03:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh the incident and coming up with a
 
03:53:39.590 --> 03:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
determination it also states that that
 
03:53:40.950 --> 03:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
if they cannot come up with a
 
03:53:44.830 --> 03:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
determination in 90 days the panel has
 
03:53:47.670 --> 03:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
to put in writing why it is going to be
 
03:53:48.870 --> 03:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
longer than
 
03:53:48.880 --> 03:53:50.590 align:start position:0%
longer than
that

03:53:50.590 --> 03:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:53:54.189 --> 03:53:54.199 align:start position:0%
and every 30 days after that with an
 
03:53:59.110 --> 03:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
update um there have been uh cases where
 
03:54:03.149 --> 03:54:03.159 align:start position:0%
it's been 11 plus months to get a
 
03:54:06.189 --> 03:54:06.199 align:start position:0%
determination um and I find that a very
 
03:54:09.229 --> 03:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
long time there was very communic little
 
03:54:11.229 --> 03:54:11.239 align:start position:0%
communication back and forth on what was
 
03:54:14.670 --> 03:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
going on and here you have this person
 
03:54:15.750 --> 03:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
wondering whether they're going to be
 
03:54:17.510 --> 03:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
able to take care of their family or
 
03:54:18.950 --> 03:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
whatever is their license going to go
 
03:54:21.630 --> 03:54:21.640 align:start position:0%
away is it not uh and I think that's a
 
03:54:25.910 --> 03:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
very long time the other piece of this
 
03:54:25.920 --> 03:54:28.309 align:start position:0%
very long time the other piece of this
is

03:54:28.309 --> 03:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:54:33.510 --> 03:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
um removes the web page that list
 
03:54:37.590 --> 03:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
everybody that's um had a determination
 
03:54:39.429 --> 03:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
or a finding
 
03:54:41.830 --> 03:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
in public view
 
03:54:47.269 --> 03:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
um this has been weaponized by uh some
 
03:54:50.550 --> 03:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
of the members of where maybe this
 
03:54:53.429 --> 03:54:53.439 align:start position:0%
person under investigation gets work is
 
03:54:57.469 --> 03:54:57.479 align:start position:0%
working uh I've had personal um reports
 
03:55:00.510 --> 03:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
to me firsthand that you know somebody
 
03:55:01.750 --> 03:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
went under
 
03:55:06.750 --> 03:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
investigation of not too serious an
 
03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
incident with people saying hey I can't
 
03:55:11.389 --> 03:55:11.399 align:start position:0%
wait to see your name up on the
 
03:55:15.070 --> 03:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
website so I'd like that page taken down
 
03:55:16.750 --> 03:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
the information will still be available
 
03:55:19.189 --> 03:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
with a phone call an email or whatever
 
03:55:21.550 --> 03:55:21.560 align:start position:0%
if they if someone is truly interested
 
03:55:23.309 --> 03:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
in what's going on with that person if
 
03:55:24.590 --> 03:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to hire them they want
 
03:55:27.630 --> 03:55:27.640 align:start position:0%
their background they can still get it
 
03:55:30.110 --> 03:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
um the other thing about that web page
 
03:55:32.870 --> 03:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
is that they had people listed on there
 
03:55:34.389 --> 03:55:34.399 align:start position:0%
that had passed
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
away and when the family members reached
 
03:55:40.110 --> 03:55:40.120 align:start position:0%
out they were told yeah we can't take
 
03:55:41.469 --> 03:55:41.479 align:start position:0%
the name down there's nothing in law
 
03:55:44.149 --> 03:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
that allows us to to do that so that
 
03:55:46.750 --> 03:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
person was going to live in infamy
 
03:55:48.990 --> 03:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
forever even though they were dead and
 
03:55:50.229 --> 03:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
there was no way they were coming back
 
03:55:51.510 --> 03:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
to get a
 
03:55:54.990 --> 03:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
job so that's pretty much what this does
 
03:55:58.349 --> 03:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
I think is fixing uh some wrongs that
 
03:56:01.910 --> 03:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
have been in the EMS system for a while
 
03:56:04.750 --> 03:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
um I've heard numerous as I was looking
 
03:56:08.189 --> 03:56:08.199 align:start position:0%
to do this numerous people who feel that
 
03:56:11.030 --> 03:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
they really weren't treated very well
 
03:56:14.630 --> 03:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
um and um the
 
03:56:19.110 --> 03:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
process um was kind of rough so I I
 
03:56:20.950 --> 03:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
would hope that members would vote with
 
03:56:24.030 --> 03:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
me to uh fix this issue and if anybody
 
03:56:25.309 --> 03:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
has any questions I'll try and answer
 
03:56:26.389 --> 03:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
them for
 
03:56:28.469 --> 03:56:28.479 align:start position:0%
him thank you representative Stone did
 
03:56:29.830 --> 03:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to your a second thank
 
03:56:31.590 --> 03:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I would I think this
 
03:56:34.349 --> 03:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
process outlays uh a little bit more due
 
03:56:36.349 --> 03:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
process that's been afforded in the past
 
03:56:38.070 --> 03:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
and I could see this as being a positive
 
03:56:39.670 --> 03:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
03:56:41.389 --> 03:56:41.399 align:start position:0%
with professional
 
03:56:45.349 --> 03:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
licensing thank you um I had a couple a
 
03:56:49.070 --> 03:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
couple initial reactions first I I was a
 
03:56:51.469 --> 03:56:51.479 align:start position:0%
little I questioned the part about
 
03:56:55.349 --> 03:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
taking down the the information but now
 
03:56:56.910 --> 03:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
that it's clear to me that the the
 
03:56:58.469 --> 03:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
information is
 
03:57:02.349 --> 03:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
not unavailable to to anyone to check
 
03:57:05.670 --> 03:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
it's just not published and as this is
 
03:57:06.950 --> 03:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
um these are people that work for
 
03:57:09.550 --> 03:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
private companies at AMR ambulance or
 
03:57:11.950 --> 03:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
something like that it it's I don't see
 
03:57:14.349 --> 03:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
a public interest in putting people's
 
03:57:16.149 --> 03:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
names it's not it's not like you can
 
03:57:18.910 --> 03:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
pick your own EMT so you you know an
 
03:57:20.550 --> 03:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
ambulance comes you can't go oh wait a
 
03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
minute let me look check and see that
 
03:57:23.389 --> 03:57:23.399 align:start position:0%
person's I mean they work there or they
 
03:57:25.950 --> 03:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
don't it's up to the companies to decide
 
03:57:28.070 --> 03:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
um and if it's open to companies to call
 
03:57:29.790 --> 03:57:29.800 align:start position:0%
and get a list of people or check on
 
03:57:32.309 --> 03:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
someone's history then it's fine with me
 
03:57:34.349 --> 03:57:34.359 align:start position:0%
as long as it's available I don't see
 
03:57:36.830 --> 03:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
the the interest in the public to
 
03:57:38.309 --> 03:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
shaming people in regards to what
 
03:57:42.510 --> 03:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
happened in their careers um also with
 
03:57:46.030 --> 03:57:46.040 align:start position:0%
regard to the the panel I I feel like
 
03:57:47.510 --> 03:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's you know when we look at medicine
 
03:57:49.670 --> 03:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
the practice of medicine doctors have a
 
03:57:52.429 --> 03:57:52.439 align:start position:0%
board they have a peer review board in
 
03:57:54.630 --> 03:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
the hospital and when it comes to their
 
03:57:57.070 --> 03:57:57.080 align:start position:0%
license they also have a Board of
 
03:58:00.149 --> 03:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
Medicine that reviews What's Done um and
 
03:58:02.550 --> 03:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
they're experts um they have the ability
 
03:58:05.670 --> 03:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
to get experts to look at every case and
 
03:58:07.830 --> 03:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's not never would they have for
 
03:58:12.349 --> 03:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
example a an internist um or or someone
 
03:58:14.630 --> 03:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
there you know brand new out a medical
 
03:58:17.389 --> 03:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
school reviewing a surgeon for example
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
so it makes sense to me to have someone
 
03:58:22.590 --> 03:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
of a higher or equal um background in
 
03:58:24.309 --> 03:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
more than just one person making a
 
03:58:26.870 --> 03:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
decision on someone's career so I I'm
 
03:58:28.590 --> 03:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
going to I'm going to support this and I
 
03:58:30.349 --> 03:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
would ask the members to consider that
 
03:58:33.630 --> 03:58:33.640 align:start position:0%
and do so as well further discussion
 
03:58:33.640 --> 03:58:36.229 align:start position:0%
and do so as well further discussion
represent

03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:39.550 --> 03:58:39.560 align:start position:0%
wheeler oh okay
 
03:58:43.309 --> 03:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
representative um Harry gather um I
 
03:58:46.110 --> 03:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
actually thought that this was a pretty
 
03:58:48.990 --> 03:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
good bill initially um and what I did
 
03:58:51.510 --> 03:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
like about it was the uh three member
 
03:58:54.590 --> 03:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
disciplinary um review panel I thought
 
03:58:56.910 --> 03:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
that was a great way instead of having
 
03:58:59.670 --> 03:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
just one or two people making decisions
 
03:58:59.680 --> 03:59:00.510 align:start position:0%
just one or two people making decisions
like

03:59:00.510 --> 03:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:59:04.110 --> 03:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
that but when I go to page
 
03:59:04.120 --> 03:59:06.309 align:start position:0%
that but when I go to page
two

03:59:06.309 --> 03:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:59:09.469 --> 03:59:09.479 align:start position:0%
um Roman num 5
 
03:59:11.070 --> 03:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
when it talks
 
03:59:14.469 --> 03:59:14.479 align:start position:0%
about the 5 Years From the end of the ly
 
03:59:17.990 --> 03:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
discipline that this be removed um I'm
 
03:59:20.790 --> 03:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
really not for that I definitely believe
 
03:59:23.389 --> 03:59:23.399 align:start position:0%
that this second piece of that where it
 
03:59:26.750 --> 03:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
talks about the death of a person I am
 
03:59:28.510 --> 03:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
very much for
 
03:59:31.349 --> 03:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
that I don't believe that once someone
 
03:59:33.149 --> 03:59:33.159 align:start position:0%
has left this Earth that you need to
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
continue um dispersing them for any
 
03:59:37.439 --> 03:59:39.469 align:start position:0%
continue um dispersing them for any
reason

03:59:39.469 --> 03:59:39.479 align:start position:0%
reason
 
03:59:41.309 --> 03:59:41.319 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to say I'm not going to
 
03:59:47.149 --> 03:59:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:51.670 --> 03:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
this if I may representative Pro so that
 
03:59:55.030 --> 03:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
piece was actually uh part of when the
 
03:59:56.710 --> 03:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
web page was up that the names were
 
03:59:59.070 --> 03:59:59.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to come off the web page and
 
04:00:00.710 --> 04:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
and go into the file and still be
 
04:00:01.950 --> 04:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
available in the
 
04:00:04.910 --> 04:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
file uh there was an oversight on that
 
04:00:08.870 --> 04:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
didn't coming out not coming out um
 
04:00:11.990 --> 04:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
so I can make that come out that that
 
04:00:14.110 --> 04:00:14.120 align:start position:0%
information is still available it's just
 
04:00:20.670 --> 04:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
page representative
 
04:00:25.269 --> 04:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr
 
04:00:27.469 --> 04:00:27.479 align:start position:0%
chair um I know I've spoken with with
 
04:00:30.389 --> 04:00:30.399 align:start position:0%
representative PR I I like most of this
 
04:00:32.550 --> 04:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
bill I still have concerns about the
 
04:00:38.070 --> 04:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
very last part um and I I hear his his
 
04:00:39.710 --> 04:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
his the history that he has an
 
04:00:43.510 --> 04:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
experience he had about a um this
 
04:00:45.950 --> 04:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
information being weaponized and I I can
 
04:00:49.229 --> 04:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
I can see how that can happen but I
 
04:00:51.030 --> 04:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
think those people that are going to do
 
04:00:52.790 --> 04:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
that no matter what whether there's a
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
website or there isn't a website um and
 
04:00:58.670 --> 04:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
I I just I see it as a transparency
 
04:01:01.469 --> 04:01:01.479 align:start position:0%
issue I think as a as a retired nurse I
 
04:01:04.070 --> 04:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
know that if there were disciplinary
 
04:01:06.750 --> 04:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
disciplinary actions taken um not during
 
04:01:09.550 --> 04:01:09.560 align:start position:0%
the in investigation pH by what Upon A
 
04:01:11.910 --> 04:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
determination that that information it's
 
04:01:14.110 --> 04:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
sent out in um newsletters from the
 
04:01:15.990 --> 04:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
board of registration and nursing that
 
04:01:17.269 --> 04:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
information is on the board of
 
04:01:20.030 --> 04:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
registration and Nursing website um so
 
04:01:25.309 --> 04:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
that um even if um you're we don't pick
 
04:01:28.510 --> 04:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily A a um uh an emergency
 
04:01:32.110 --> 04:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
medical personnel if there is
 
04:01:34.870 --> 04:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
information that is publicly available
 
04:01:37.550 --> 04:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
on whether it's on certification or reg
 
04:01:39.429 --> 04:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
a board
 
04:01:41.429 --> 04:01:41.439 align:start position:0%
registration it may not make a
 
04:01:44.710 --> 04:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
difference right away but if you're the
 
04:01:46.990 --> 04:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
parent say of a child who goes in an
 
04:01:50.110 --> 04:01:50.120 align:start position:0%
ambulance and there's a concern over
 
04:01:53.790 --> 04:01:53.800 align:start position:0%
whatever treatment um and then you go to
 
04:01:56.550 --> 04:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
look back about you know the care that
 
04:01:59.910 --> 04:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
that your child may have received um I
 
04:02:02.070 --> 04:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
do think that that information should be
 
04:02:05.070 --> 04:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
available publicly um just as it is for
 
04:02:06.790 --> 04:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
the board of Registration of Medicine or
 
04:02:08.910 --> 04:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
the board of registration of Nursing or
 
04:02:12.950 --> 04:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers um uh so that's I I
 
04:02:14.710 --> 04:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
still have that problem the rest I agree
 
04:02:17.309 --> 04:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
about the the five year the excuse me
 
04:02:19.309 --> 04:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
about the um when a person is deceased
 
04:02:23.189 --> 04:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
fully support that um I also support the
 
04:02:25.510 --> 04:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
the um the disciplinary review panel I
 
04:02:27.550 --> 04:02:27.560 align:start position:0%
think that's a really good idea too it's
 
04:02:31.070 --> 04:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
just I'm I'm just concerned about um the
 
04:02:34.030 --> 04:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
transparency issue and I and I I I don't
 
04:02:35.590 --> 04:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
know it would be hard for me to support
 
04:02:37.670 --> 04:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
it with that still in it thank you I
 
04:02:39.550 --> 04:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
04:02:41.990 --> 04:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
repr approv does the nursing board have
 
04:02:44.389 --> 04:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
a website that
 
04:02:47.189 --> 04:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
listed I don't know maybe yeah I don't
 
04:02:49.309 --> 04:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
I've have not looked so that's I mean if
 
04:02:51.510 --> 04:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
they have a website that list everybody
 
04:02:54.630 --> 04:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
then I I get it but as far as I know the
 
04:02:56.910 --> 04:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
EMS board is the only one that does
 
04:03:00.550 --> 04:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
this I believe you can look up a doctor
 
04:03:03.070 --> 04:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know about a nurse but there's
 
04:03:05.469 --> 04:03:05.479 align:start position:0%
no website like with a list right there
 
04:03:06.990 --> 04:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
you have to go in and click the doctor's
 
04:03:09.550 --> 04:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
name so you know that whole weaponizing
 
04:03:14.229 --> 04:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
thing they have a a a big TV screen and
 
04:03:16.590 --> 04:03:16.600 align:start position:0%
up on it is the list when that person is
 
04:03:18.590 --> 04:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
working because they said oh we're we're
 
04:03:21.590 --> 04:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
waiting to see your name pop up so it's
 
04:03:24.750 --> 04:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
not like they had to go look at at their
 
04:03:29.149 --> 04:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
file send a email requesting it or such
 
04:03:31.550 --> 04:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
but it's just this big thing that's
 
04:03:36.189 --> 04:03:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:40.469 --> 04:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
and Wheeler thank you Mr chairman I I
 
04:03:42.229 --> 04:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
have a question for representative Pro
 
04:03:43.790 --> 04:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
and you've kind of touched on this in
 
04:03:45.309 --> 04:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
04:03:47.990 --> 04:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
this saying that the finding or
 
04:03:49.590 --> 04:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
determinations of such
 
04:03:51.630 --> 04:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
investigations are not available via the
 
04:03:54.429 --> 04:03:54.439 align:start position:0%
Internet or the website does not mean
 
04:03:57.510 --> 04:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
that this information is not
 
04:03:59.790 --> 04:03:59.800 align:start position:0%
available that is correct you call them
 
04:04:01.189 --> 04:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
and say hey I want to find out about
 
04:04:03.309 --> 04:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
Mark crew is he a good EMT does he have
 
04:04:06.189 --> 04:04:06.199 align:start position:0%
any any bad spots on his record they
 
04:04:09.149 --> 04:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
will tell you kind
 
04:04:11.269 --> 04:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
um my next question would be how would
 
04:04:12.710 --> 04:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
somebody go about getting that
 
04:04:14.189 --> 04:04:14.199 align:start position:0%
information they would just contact the
 
04:04:17.110 --> 04:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
director contact the bureau VMS say hey
 
04:04:20.910 --> 04:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
we're looking to hire Mark crew um can I
 
04:04:24.469 --> 04:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
get his record is there any uh findings
 
04:04:26.910 --> 04:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
you know disciplinary findings in his
 
04:04:30.429 --> 04:04:30.439 align:start position:0%
file and and that stuff so it's not a
 
04:04:32.830 --> 04:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
ban on no allowing absolutely not
 
04:04:35.710 --> 04:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
because I I don't want a bad EMT coming
 
04:04:37.229 --> 04:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
to pick me up when I'm laying on the
 
04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
ground looking up right yeah I want to
 
04:04:42.269 --> 04:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody uh is doing what
 
04:04:44.670 --> 04:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to and if they violated
 
04:04:47.870 --> 04:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
uh their oath and and such I want people
 
04:04:49.870 --> 04:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
to know about it but I just don't want
 
04:04:53.070 --> 04:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
it out there weaponized yeah and I I
 
04:04:54.710 --> 04:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's what I was my point when I said
 
04:04:57.510 --> 04:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
about um public shaming it's different
 
04:04:59.750 --> 04:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
if you want the information to make a
 
04:05:02.070 --> 04:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
hiring determination or what have you
 
04:05:03.670 --> 04:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
but it's different to just put someone's
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
name out there for no other reason than
 
04:05:09.309 --> 04:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
to just say hey look at this person did
 
04:05:10.990 --> 04:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
um that's what I was the point I was
 
04:05:12.189 --> 04:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
making representative
 
04:05:15.030 --> 04:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you Mr chair uh under
 
04:05:15.040 --> 04:05:16.469 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you Mr chair uh under
Section

04:05:16.469 --> 04:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
Section
 
04:05:19.870 --> 04:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
Five does anything prohibit a uh
 
04:05:22.830 --> 04:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
director from not removing it if uh they
 
04:05:26.030 --> 04:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
deem it to be an issue such as maybe a
 
04:05:27.550 --> 04:05:27.560 align:start position:0%
person shouldn't hold a license for the
 
04:05:30.950 --> 04:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:33.550 --> 04:05:33.560 align:start position:0%
career so can he leave it up there
 
04:05:36.070 --> 04:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
correct is that his at his discretion as
 
04:05:37.950 --> 04:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
it stands right now they can't remove it
 
04:05:40.870 --> 04:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
once it's on but your bill would allow
 
04:05:43.070 --> 04:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
them to if they determine to remove it
 
04:05:44.670 --> 04:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
right is that the way I'm reading it
 
04:05:48.670 --> 04:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
correctly uh no shall so I imagine so if
 
04:05:51.950 --> 04:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
you read it it's five years after their
 
04:05:55.269 --> 04:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
um uh discipline is over so if they were
 
04:05:55.279 --> 04:05:56.590 align:start position:0%
um uh discipline is over so if they were
permanently

04:05:56.590 --> 04:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
permanently
 
04:05:59.149 --> 04:05:59.159 align:start position:0%
revoked there's no five years after that
 
04:06:01.269 --> 04:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
they're revoked for their lifetime when
 
04:06:02.990 --> 04:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
they when they pass then you could
 
04:06:05.189 --> 04:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
remove them so follow up it that' be a
 
04:06:08.030 --> 04:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
permanent record if they're revoked for
 
04:06:11.830 --> 04:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:15.630 --> 04:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:18.309 --> 04:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you I think one of the things
 
04:06:20.070 --> 04:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
that we need to pay attention to in this
 
04:06:22.149 --> 04:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
is I think there's a a difference
 
04:06:25.550 --> 04:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
between intent which I think is good uh
 
04:06:28.389 --> 04:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
and the actual language of the bill so
 
04:06:31.670 --> 04:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
if you if you take a look page
 
04:06:35.790 --> 04:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
two uh line nine it says the director
 
04:06:38.510 --> 04:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
shall not publish or make public public
 
04:06:40.950 --> 04:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
any ongoing investigations including the
 
04:06:43.750 --> 04:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
findings or determinations of such
 
04:06:46.510 --> 04:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
investigations uh via the Internet or
 
04:06:49.590 --> 04:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
website so I think one of the things
 
04:06:53.710 --> 04:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
that we need to be extremely careful
 
04:06:53.720 --> 04:06:56.070 align:start position:0%
that we need to be extremely careful
about

04:06:56.070 --> 04:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:07:00.189 --> 04:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
um is creating a situation where there
 
04:07:03.269 --> 04:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
really would be any any less
 
04:07:05.389 --> 04:07:05.399 align:start position:0%
transparency uh when it comes to these
 
04:07:07.830 --> 04:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
investigations than uh than we have now
 
04:07:12.070 --> 04:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
now um I think um the in you know saying
 
04:07:14.750 --> 04:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
the internet or website it's extremely
 
04:07:17.630 --> 04:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
broad what what do we mean you know
 
04:07:22.269 --> 04:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
exactly uh you know by that um It just
 
04:07:24.070 --> 04:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
strikes me that
 
04:07:27.630 --> 04:07:27.640 align:start position:0%
the that um that the language that we're
 
04:07:32.590 --> 04:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
using here is is is is overly broad um
 
04:07:34.990 --> 04:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
and in the end may not actually
 
04:07:37.990 --> 04:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
accomplish what the what the sponsors
 
04:07:40.750 --> 04:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
looking to uh to accomplish without
 
04:07:48.149 --> 04:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:48.159 --> 04:07:49.790 align:start position:0%
 
consequences

04:07:49.790 --> 04:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
04:07:53.950 --> 04:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
no yeah great second presed Murphy thank
 
04:07:56.830 --> 04:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
you um I looked up the the um the
 
04:07:58.309 --> 04:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
information that I would like to see
 
04:08:00.229 --> 04:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
retained in these situations if a
 
04:08:02.830 --> 04:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
determination has uh been made is
 
04:08:04.990 --> 04:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
similar to the um New Hampshire office
 
04:08:06.870 --> 04:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
of profession professional licensure and
 
04:08:08.349 --> 04:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
certification looked at the board of
 
04:08:10.630 --> 04:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
nursing and how we do it and the board
 
04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
of nursing actions retains a
 
04:08:14.670 --> 04:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
disciplinary documents on this website
 
04:08:16.950 --> 04:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
for a 7-year period you can look it up
 
04:08:21.870 --> 04:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
by by um year and um you know you can
 
04:08:25.149 --> 04:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
verify lure so that's the part that I'm
 
04:08:28.510 --> 04:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
looking to I think I agree with you I
 
04:08:30.950 --> 04:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
just think that what this says is that
 
04:08:32.990 --> 04:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
there's no documentation and it can be
 
04:08:36.510 --> 04:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
just so if there's a way to say that
 
04:08:39.189 --> 04:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
this information would be kept on
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
something like this I think that makes
 
04:08:44.269 --> 04:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
sense um but I it's just right now it's
 
04:08:46.429 --> 04:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
just too broad it's basic in the way I
 
04:08:49.469 --> 04:08:49.479 align:start position:0%
read it it just says you that there's
 
04:08:52.109 --> 04:08:52.119 align:start position:0%
going to be no um publishing of
 
04:08:53.950 --> 04:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
determinations of Investigations on the
 
04:08:56.550 --> 04:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
Internet or website so that would make
 
04:08:58.710 --> 04:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
me think that it's meant to preclude
 
04:09:00.630 --> 04:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
something like this and I don't think
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
that's what we want to
 
04:09:06.070 --> 04:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
do it sounds like a represent Pro go
 
04:09:08.790 --> 04:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
ahead so give you a history of my
 
04:09:10.469 --> 04:09:10.479 align:start position:0%
background that is really kind of
 
04:09:12.510 --> 04:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
driving this for me is that I run the
 
04:09:14.109 --> 04:09:14.119 align:start position:0%
grand State critical instance stress
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
management team um that we assist police
 
04:09:19.830 --> 04:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
Fire EMS and all emergency responders
 
04:09:22.429 --> 04:09:22.439 align:start position:0%
including Hospital staff um get through
 
04:09:25.389 --> 04:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
really bad calls and manage uh critical
 
04:09:29.750 --> 04:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
stress that leads to Suicide right so my
 
04:09:33.109 --> 04:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
number one goal right now is preventing
 
04:09:35.670 --> 04:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
suicide and First Responders whatever
 
04:09:38.309 --> 04:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
that takes and I try to remove move any
 
04:09:44.229 --> 04:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
additional stress to them and to me
 
04:09:44.239 --> 04:09:46.309 align:start position:0%
additional stress to them and to me
uh

04:09:46.309 --> 04:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:09:49.590 --> 04:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
this web page that is just their
 
04:09:52.389 --> 04:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
disciplinary web page which I'm trying
 
04:09:53.950 --> 04:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
to get to here in a
 
04:09:56.429 --> 04:09:56.439 align:start position:0%
second and and
 
04:10:01.630 --> 04:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
it's not listed by year it's just
 
04:10:06.429 --> 04:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
listed everyone even if they're dead
 
04:10:06.439 --> 04:10:12.670 align:start position:0%
listed everyone even if they're dead
um

04:10:12.670 --> 04:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:16.990 --> 04:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
so to relieve some of that
 
04:10:21.990 --> 04:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
stress uh I think making it harder just
 
04:10:24.389 --> 04:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
a little bit harder that it's not so
 
04:10:27.630 --> 04:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:32.830 --> 04:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:35.429 --> 04:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
who are just trying to weaponize it
 
04:10:36.910 --> 04:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
right they're not they're not there
 
04:10:38.149 --> 04:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
because they're going to hire that
 
04:10:40.149 --> 04:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
person they're not there because they
 
04:10:43.790 --> 04:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
have some issue that oh hey I was on
 
04:10:45.469 --> 04:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
they came to my house and that guy with
 
04:10:48.109 --> 04:10:48.119 align:start position:0%
a name tag I want to find out about him
 
04:10:50.189 --> 04:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
sure they can call EMS and say hey what
 
04:10:52.950 --> 04:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
about that EMT Mark Pro right what's the
 
04:10:54.710 --> 04:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
deal with him does he have anything in
 
04:10:57.990 --> 04:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
his background as opposed to this big
 
04:10:58.000 --> 04:10:59.630 align:start position:0%
his background as opposed to this big
poster

04:10:59.630 --> 04:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
poster
 
04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
that I don't
 
04:11:05.910 --> 04:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
know may I um May I make a suggestion it
 
04:11:09.349 --> 04:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
sounds like um everyone in here agrees
 
04:11:12.389 --> 04:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
on a good portion of this bill but there
 
04:11:14.910 --> 04:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
are some significant hurdles that are
 
04:11:18.670 --> 04:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
going to keep a uh a majority to vote
 
04:11:22.269 --> 04:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
out to pass I think that perhaps given
 
04:11:24.070 --> 04:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
the time because we don't have really
 
04:11:26.149 --> 04:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
the time to wait for another amendment
 
04:11:30.030 --> 04:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
we vote um however that comes out and
 
04:11:31.710 --> 04:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
then representative PR and maybe
 
04:11:32.910 --> 04:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy could work
 
04:11:34.910 --> 04:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
together because it's going to finance
 
04:11:38.030 --> 04:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
and you can be amended again and finance
 
04:11:41.030 --> 04:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
but if we we have to act on it today so
 
04:11:44.309 --> 04:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
if if you could get agreement and get an
 
04:11:46.349 --> 04:11:46.359 align:start position:0%
amendment in finance and then before it
 
04:11:48.630 --> 04:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
comes to the floor with an OTP and
 
04:11:50.109 --> 04:11:50.119 align:start position:0%
enough people will commit I think you
 
04:11:53.070 --> 04:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
can pass this thing this year so what do
 
04:11:54.870 --> 04:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
you I'm willing to work with anybody to
 
04:11:56.990 --> 04:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
try and get to where we need to be
 
04:11:59.710 --> 04:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
because I truly don't want to make it
 
04:12:01.630 --> 04:12:01.640 align:start position:0%
impossible for people to find out about
 
04:12:04.189 --> 04:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
bad EMTs because I don't want that
 
04:12:05.870 --> 04:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
either yeah I think if you look at the
 
04:12:07.349 --> 04:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
language they're going to come get me
 
04:12:08.550 --> 04:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
right if you look at the language
 
04:12:10.030 --> 04:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
whatever the law is that allows the
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
nursing to do that it might already be
 
04:12:13.309 --> 04:12:13.319 align:start position:0%
there and you just take it and copy it
 
04:12:17.349 --> 04:12:17.359 align:start position:0%
and so so I'll reach out to uh um
 
04:12:18.870 --> 04:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
because let's get it out of here Senate
 
04:12:21.070 --> 04:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
the finance you continue to work see if
 
04:12:23.670 --> 04:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
um whoever what division gets it and
 
04:12:24.830 --> 04:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
they might entertain your Amendment
 
04:12:24.840 --> 04:12:28.349 align:start position:0%
they might entertain your Amendment
representative

04:12:28.349 --> 04:12:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:31.710 --> 04:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
Newman I just want to this process we
 
04:12:33.950 --> 04:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
you would prefer we vote it in this
 
04:12:37.189 --> 04:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
condition than it is and then if we if
 
04:12:39.590 --> 04:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
if it gets to finance and finance
 
04:12:41.389 --> 04:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't an amendment or they don't agree
 
04:12:43.710 --> 04:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
with the amendment that they put out
 
04:12:46.870 --> 04:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
then it gets passed the way it is no no
 
04:12:48.469 --> 04:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
I'm not asking you to vote you vote
 
04:12:50.389 --> 04:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
however you want here no I I know I
 
04:12:52.189 --> 04:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
understand I'm just I'm I'm asking the
 
04:12:54.070 --> 04:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
process that's that's let's say that
 
04:12:56.070 --> 04:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
process let's say we vote 1010 or
 
04:12:58.429 --> 04:12:58.439 align:start position:0%
whatever we have here today and it goes
 
04:13:00.550 --> 04:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
to finance and finance tells him nah get
 
04:13:02.309 --> 04:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
out of here with your Amendment he can
 
04:13:04.429 --> 04:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
then go with the floor Amendment um or
 
04:13:05.750 --> 04:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
they could say no the money's not there
 
04:13:07.189 --> 04:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
I mean there's a lot of different scenar
 
04:13:11.389 --> 04:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
iOS but in order to to get the support
 
04:13:13.710 --> 04:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
of members in this committee at least
 
04:13:15.309 --> 04:13:15.319 align:start position:0%
that have said they would support it if
 
04:13:17.429 --> 04:13:17.439 align:start position:0%
it was changed I would recommend that he
 
04:13:18.830 --> 04:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
do that and there's an opportunity of
 
04:13:20.990 --> 04:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
Finance I would do it here but we're out
 
04:13:23.109 --> 04:13:23.119 align:start position:0%
of time um because of the
 
04:13:25.750 --> 04:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
deadline so vote how you're going to
 
04:13:28.269 --> 04:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
vote it's going to finance
 
04:13:31.710 --> 04:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
regardless um even if it comes out of
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
here itl is still going to finance so
 
04:13:37.389 --> 04:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
there's another bite at that apple
 
04:13:37.399 --> 04:13:38.630 align:start position:0%
there's another bite at that apple
representative

04:13:38.630 --> 04:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:13:41.710 --> 04:13:41.720 align:start position:0%
Pratt I might assume that in finance
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
they would address the inflation of the
 
04:13:46.750 --> 04:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
cost of this bill would be the prime
 
04:13:48.870 --> 04:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
reason that they would deal with it yeah
 
04:13:51.109 --> 04:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
there is an inflation
 
04:13:51.119 --> 04:13:53.389 align:start position:0%
there is an inflation
here

04:13:53.389 --> 04:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:13:55.670 --> 04:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
site although Finance is going to look
 
04:13:57.269 --> 04:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
at the money I think you've said
 
04:14:00.750 --> 04:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
something important which is that this
 
04:14:04.349 --> 04:14:04.359 align:start position:0%
committee would send a a wink in effect
 
04:14:08.790 --> 04:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
that we're willing to uh modify
 
04:14:14.670 --> 04:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
fine-tune the language to uh reflect
 
04:14:17.229 --> 04:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
what pretty much is the consensus of the
 
04:14:19.790 --> 04:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
good intentions of the bill something
 
04:14:23.309 --> 04:14:23.319 align:start position:0%
that's not been talked about and I I
 
04:14:26.030 --> 04:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
would I couldn't vote for this without
 
04:14:28.590 --> 04:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
that understanding is this
 
04:14:32.030 --> 04:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
whole uh I guess it's my Edna experience
 
04:14:35.710 --> 04:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
but the pool of applicants is um uh
 
04:14:37.670 --> 04:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
appointed by one person
 
04:14:40.389 --> 04:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
is he is there a term is it an ad hoc
 
04:14:43.870 --> 04:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
committee is it uh uh can he be serves
 
04:14:46.950 --> 04:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
at the pleasure uh that that whole thing
 
04:14:50.269 --> 04:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
that disciplinary re review panel needs
 
04:14:53.469 --> 04:14:53.479 align:start position:0%
to be firmed up specified something but
 
04:14:57.189 --> 04:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
right now uh there he can appoint a 100
 
04:15:00.389 --> 04:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
people there's no limit there's
 
04:15:04.149 --> 04:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
no it is not defined and that needs to
 
04:15:07.229 --> 04:15:07.239 align:start position:0%
for my vote that needs to be uh good
 
04:15:09.670 --> 04:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
intention or not that needs to be uh
 
04:15:09.680 --> 04:15:11.870 align:start position:0%
intention or not that needs to be uh
adjusted

04:15:11.870 --> 04:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
adjusted
 
04:15:14.429 --> 04:15:14.439 align:start position:0%
or uh
 
04:15:19.109 --> 04:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
made made definite uh as to how it
 
04:15:21.950 --> 04:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
operates how it's appointed uh whatever
 
04:15:27.070 --> 04:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:32.389 --> 04:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:35.389 --> 04:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
there I would suggest you look at it um
 
04:15:37.510 --> 04:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
based on based on that
 
04:15:38.990 --> 04:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
um since we do have to move this out of
 
04:15:40.870 --> 04:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
here today um I think we've had enough
 
04:15:43.070 --> 04:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
discussion what we'll do is we'll vote
 
04:15:45.510 --> 04:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
and then it goes to finance I would um
 
04:15:48.349 --> 04:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
I'll send a note to finance and say that
 
04:15:50.030 --> 04:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
there were a couple policy issues that
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
we ran at a time that we'd like to see
 
04:15:53.590 --> 04:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
and I would appreciate if they would
 
04:15:55.349 --> 04:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
entertain an amendment that was brought
 
04:16:00.349 --> 04:16:00.359 align:start position:0%
by representative PR um and if um if
 
04:16:01.750 --> 04:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
they will that's good and if not he'll
 
04:16:03.349 --> 04:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
have to do it on the
 
04:16:07.229 --> 04:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
floor but um it sounds like if he fix
 
04:16:08.910 --> 04:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
those couple things he'd at least have
 
04:16:11.870 --> 04:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
the support of the entire committee so
 
04:16:12.990 --> 04:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler just really
 
04:16:14.349 --> 04:16:14.359 align:start position:0%
quickly Mr chairman thank you I just
 
04:16:16.550 --> 04:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
have a process question I'm wondering
 
04:16:19.109 --> 04:16:19.119 align:start position:0%
instead of having this motion go to itl
 
04:16:20.389 --> 04:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to bring this
 
04:16:22.309 --> 04:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
motion to the floor with an interim
 
04:16:24.710 --> 04:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
study reverse that motion and then amend
 
04:16:26.309 --> 04:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
it from there rather than it go to the
 
04:16:28.670 --> 04:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
floor with an ideal motion I don't know
 
04:16:29.990 --> 04:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
that it would go to finance with an
 
04:16:33.389 --> 04:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
interm study so it we that might happen
 
04:16:34.950 --> 04:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
and then we would reverse it and then it
 
04:16:37.710 --> 04:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
would go back to finance again um or it
 
04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
would be recommitted I mean we can make
 
04:16:41.630 --> 04:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
a motion Go finance immediately after
 
04:16:44.149 --> 04:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
our committee it goes to the floor no
 
04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's what that's yeah yeah yeah so
 
04:16:50.149 --> 04:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure what the best way to
 
04:16:52.590 --> 04:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
do that would be representative Stone
 
04:16:54.590 --> 04:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh knowing that
 
04:16:56.469 --> 04:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
there' be bipartisan support from
 
04:16:59.309 --> 04:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
representative PR and Murphy I'd be okay
 
04:17:01.109 --> 04:17:01.119 align:start position:0%
with voting a to pass at this time and I
 
04:17:01.119 --> 04:17:02.750 align:start position:0%
with voting a to pass at this time and I
support

04:17:02.750 --> 04:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:17:06.109 --> 04:17:06.119 align:start position:0%
that representative Murray thank you Mr
 
04:17:08.950 --> 04:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
chair I was going to suggest maybe if
 
04:17:11.149 --> 04:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
representative PR and Murphy work on an
 
04:17:13.630 --> 04:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
amendment before this goes to the floor
 
04:17:16.070 --> 04:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
and then we can just pass as a floor
 
04:17:17.990 --> 04:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment and then we send it to finance
 
04:17:20.429 --> 04:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
all set that said that that made much
 
04:17:23.109 --> 04:17:23.119 align:start position:0%
more sense than everything I said um if
 
04:17:25.750 --> 04:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
if representative Murphy and PR work on
 
04:17:27.750 --> 04:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
it and it's going to come to the floor
 
04:17:29.309 --> 04:17:29.319 align:start position:0%
you bring it as a floor Amendment and
 
04:17:31.510 --> 04:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
then it will go to finance as an ought
 
04:17:35.149 --> 04:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
to pass with the policy part taken out
 
04:17:36.349 --> 04:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
right and then they can just deal with
 
04:17:37.990 --> 04:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
the money
 
04:17:38.000 --> 04:17:45.469 align:start position:0%
