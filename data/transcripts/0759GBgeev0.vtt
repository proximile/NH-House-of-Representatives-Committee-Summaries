on HP uh 212 motion is retained do I
 
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:34.760 align:start position:0%

basically the prime sponsor with this
 
00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:46.039 align:start position:0%
particular Bill feels like there's still
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
some modifications that could be made to
 
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
make it a little bit better and would
 
00:18:51.789 --> 00:18:51.799 align:start position:0%
like a little bit more time and So based
 
00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
on that I think we should retain it to
 
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
see um if those adjustments can be made
 
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240 align:start position:0%

sir uh thank you Mr chair briefly um uh
 
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things that stuck out during
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
the hearings for this one is that um to
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
our knowledge and to everybody's
 
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge who spoke nobody's ever been
 
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
cited for um this kind
 
00:21:28.269 --> 00:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
of uh Behavior Uh apparently it's never
 
00:21:31.149 --> 00:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
happened and so
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
um all of a sudden us allowing it could
 
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
have vast
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences for uh the
 
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
motoring public so that's why I am
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
itl thank you sir anybody else from the
 
00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
committee representative Miller thank
 
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um as this was my bill
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly disappointed to hear that
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
response to it uh I think the data
 
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
dramatically supports that the uh
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
closest thing to unintended consequences
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
is a better flow of traffic uh it
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
improves safety it makes traffic flow
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
better uh I'm disappointed to hear that
 
00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
the committee feels that that data is
 
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
insufficient and
 
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
inaccurate fair enough anybody else from
 
00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.070 align:start position:0%
inaccurate fair enough anybody else from

has to be done on this bill as far as um
 
00:25:57.039 --> 00:25:59.110 align:start position:0%
has to be done on this bill as far as um

00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
um the fact that we can take the Vint

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:07.000 align:start position:0%

thank realize I left it on thank you um
 
00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
good thing I was sitting here quietly uh
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
change so not and and you realize what
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
you just did would made it made it
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
really hard for me to be
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
quiet um actually we um my position
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
would be that we should itl this bill um
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
it has enough holes in it that I'm not
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
sure that we can fix it even with the
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
retention effort but uh in in view of
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
that motion we I I will support the
 
00:26:55.389 --> 00:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
retained motion to we'll give it the a
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
college try but I'm not optimistic
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you represent s and I do agree
 
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
with you the way it's currently written
 
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
I couldn't support it either um we need
 
00:27:08.909 --> 00:27:08.919 align:start position:0%
to in my opinion um keep the Integrity
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
of the VIN tags which is the whole
 
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
reason for having them uh so uh uh I
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
think it is worth taking a look at so
 
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping we can uh move on with a
 
00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
ringing so you know it was on silent and
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
and the volume was all the way down um
 
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
that being said anybody else from the
 
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none I'll ask the clerk

00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%

00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
okay I'll open up the executive session
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 411 FM relative to making
 
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
the use of mobile electronic device the
 
00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
use of mobile electronic device while
 
00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:16.039 align:start position:0%
driving a secondary offense chair
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Crawford for a
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman my motion
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
is itl on House Bill 411
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
FN the motion is in expedient to
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
legislate do we have a second second
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
representative by second by
 
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
representative SES here to speak to your
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
motion representative Crawford uh to me
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
um a secondary offense would be actually
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
kind of foolish because let's face it if
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
someone gets stopped for a headlight out
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
or even for speeding um if I'm using my
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
phone at the same time and I know I'm
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
being stopped I'm certainly going to
 
00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:54.039 align:start position:0%
throw my phone someplace else because I
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
don't want uh the police officer to know
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
that I was texting while while I was
 
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:03.559 align:start position:0%
speeding so um the whole um reason for
 
00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
having the hands-free law is to be able
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
to see someone using this and to be able
 
00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:12.039 align:start position:0%
to stop them on a primary offense so
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
that's why I recommend itl on this
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
bill anybody else representative SES yes
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
and um one thing that's really important
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
for us to remember and I appreciate the
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
what um the support for an itl motion
 
00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919 align:start position:0%
that um it is documentable that since
 
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
this bill was passed um wow I think
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
maybe more than a decade ago there have
 
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.350 align:start position:0%
maybe more than a decade ago there have
been

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
demonstrably positive results in terms
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
of fewer deaths or crashes from
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
distracted driving and so I think that's
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
an important tool to keep in the
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
department of safety's toolbox and help
 
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
protect uh people and children who are
 
00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise blameless while they drive
 
00:30:59.230 --> 00:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
down the road from people people who do
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
not follow the
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
law thank you sir anybody
 
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
else with this why shouldn't jinx
 
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
it um I'll ask the clerk to call the
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
role when she's ready the motion is
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on House Bill
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%

can speak your motion I do thank you Mr
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
chairman um regarding 414 you know we
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
had testimony um from people who said
 
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
how they've been impacted but I I
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
actually had a chance to talk to some
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
Towing uh companies and kind of wanted
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
to get their view on things and you know
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
their view
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
is U first of all this is kind of like
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
the very very very did I say very enough
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
uh Last Resort that they kind of go to
 
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
in order to try to recoup
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
um some of the expenses for the towing
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
and storing um what they all told me was
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
we try to work with the person um their
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
goal is not trying to take their license
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
away from them um but their goal is to
 
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
try to work with the person to try to
 
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
make something Equitable so they could
 
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
uh get their vehicle because the longer
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
they keep it the longer it's costing
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
them so um they really felt this uh from
 
00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
what I when I talked to them this was
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
kind of something that uh was a
 
00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
necessary tool but again they Ed at the
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
very last resort and based on getting
 
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
that information um I felt uh this bill
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
probably should be
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
ited thank you sir rep
 
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
s yeah so um I would be opposed to this
 
00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh itail motion because um we are trying
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
really hard I think as a legislature to
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
examine the circumstances under which a
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
person loses the privilege to drive and
 
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
we are trying really hard to make sure
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
that those privileges are suspended or
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
Lost based on a moving violation versus
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
an actual a fine problem um this to me
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
falls under that kind of category where
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
um persons may lose their driving
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
privileges because they have been unable
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
to pay a bill owned to a private company
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
or un or owed to for a fine of some sort
 
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
and that Vehicles get towed for lots of
 
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
reasons none of which inv many of which
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
do not involve moving violations at all
 
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
so it's a it's a in my mind a slippery
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
slope that we were we we are have fallen
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
into and I think that we should take
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate anybody else from the
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
committee representative Miller uh thank
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh to build on
 
00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
representative sy's comments uh the
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
other thing that I would note here um is
 
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
as we heard in the
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
testimony this debt is typically
 
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
incurred by force most times the person
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
having that vehicle towed does not get
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
to choose the company that tow it or
 
00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
what that rate is going to be they can't
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
shop it around they are subject to a
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
contract typically between the local uh
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
police department or authorities there
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
and who they call for the towing and so
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
as we've talked about in various other
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
bills in this committee um being forced
 
00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
into a contract with a private entity by
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
the government and as a result of that
 
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
losing your license which for most of us
 
00:36:50.309 --> 00:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
means losing your ability to work uh
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
seems uh especially unfair um and yeah I
 
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
I would also add that I got the email
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
from the towing companies as well um I
 
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
feel like it probably would have
 
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
behooved them to show up and testify if
 
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
they wanted to have their that opinion
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
felt more broadly by the committee
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
rather than having it sort of thrown in
 
00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:11.750 align:start position:0%
rather than having it sort of thrown in
last

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
minute thank
 
00:37:16.109 --> 00:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
you anybody
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
else actually I'll just chime in a
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
little bit I don't fall out of your
 
00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:23.079 align:start position:0%
chair but I actually agree with you um
 
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
in the fact that I I originally was
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
looking at a retain on this only because
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
I believe there are other things things
 
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
in the statute that could be addressed
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
um I don't think this bill does it as
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
written uh in having conversations about
 
00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
germanness and the possibility of
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
working on it without this bill uh we
 
00:37:40.309 --> 00:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
can do that for something introduced
 
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:42.839 align:start position:0%
freestanding next year so for that I'm
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
not going to support this but I do agree
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
with you that I think the statute with
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
the forc or being compelled to use
 
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
certain companies for the towing
 
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
probably needs to be looked at so uh
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
again with that I think future future
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
work is good I don't think we need this
 
00:37:58.829 --> 00:37:58.839 align:start position:0%
particular language I'll be supporting
 
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
the itl anybody else from the
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair I move inexpedient to
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 441 motions
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate do I have a
 
00:43:16.349 --> 00:43:16.359 align:start position:0%
second by representative foot care to
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion sir yes sir thank
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so under current code of
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
law this is already illegal this this
 
00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
law actually does nothing you're not
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to modify the um the fuel intake
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
exhaust Etc on a private vehicle to the
 
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
point where it would violate the OBD and
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
emission standards and that is exactly
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
what this law says is that you're not
 
00:43:40.109 --> 00:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that so it's already
 
00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
codified into law to me this is just uh
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's frivolous in that it's just
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
exists thank you sir I agree completely
 
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
this is the second time we've seen this
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
bill in two years and the same argument
 
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
was made last time anybody else from the
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
committee representative flet thank you
 
00:44:02.549 --> 00:44:02.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh just to add to that and
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
it's uh an EPA violation as well so it's
 
00:44:09.309 --> 00:44:09.319 align:start position:0%
it's federally regulated
 
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
so yep anybody else seeing that motion
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%

00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
not making the uh public hearing on this
 
00:46:56.549 --> 00:46:56.559 align:start position:0%
um but I'll just explain why I filed
 
00:46:59.790 --> 00:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
this Bill uh it started uh when I saw
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
that the department of safety had gone
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
to the executive Council seeking Monies
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
to spend taxpayer funds on providing all
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
the testing materials and testing or
 
00:47:10.589 --> 00:47:10.599 align:start position:0%
training materials and testing for the
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire driver licenses that just was
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
my my first issue with this whole thing
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
I just why are the taxpayers being
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
footing the bill for for this um but
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
then as I started digging into it um a
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
few things happened which just
 
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
solidified um why I did this and and why
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
I was glad I did this
 
00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
actually first of all we we had a rash
 
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
of uh wrongway
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
crashes on our interstates and I've
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
already had the discussion I I told him
 
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
I was going to mention it and at 5:00 in
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
the morning I was watching the news and
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh Lieutenant storm got on TV explaining
 
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
these and said we've got three problems
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
going on with the roads in New Hampshire
 
00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:00.839 align:start position:0%
right now we have impairment we have
 
00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:02.559 align:start position:0%
distraction which we know that's why we
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
just took care of the secondary fence
 
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
for for for cell phones and we have a
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
language problem and it it's true um
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
right now the the signs on our roads are
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
all in English we also have a statute
 
00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:17.910 align:start position:0%
all in English we also have a statute
that

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:21.079 align:start position:0%
says that we use English and all our our
 
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
public documents if we TR we hear it all
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
the time that we are truly here about
 
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
safety reasons and that why I put the
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
bill in again it truly doesn't make
 
00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
sense to me that if you cannot speak
 
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
English that you drive on the roads of
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
the state and get a driver's license and
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
and get
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
assisted um in um getting that
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
license just as a matter of Common Sense
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
too because I've been called xenophobe
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
I've been called racist I've been seeing
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
the emails from the week that is
 
00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't be anything further from the
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
truth just to illustrate that this is
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
safety and Common Sense even
 
00:48:59.710 --> 00:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
our feder Federal Motor Carrier safety
 
00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
regulations currently
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
State um that a person is qualified to
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
drive a commercial motor vehicle if he
 
00:49:08.829 --> 00:49:08.839 align:start position:0%
or she quote can read and speak the
 
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
English language sufficiently to
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
converse with the general public to
 
00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
understand highway traffic signs and
 
00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
signals in the English language to
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
respond to official inquiries and to
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
make entries on reports and Records I
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
didn't make this up I didn't make this
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
concept up this has apparently been a
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
common sense issue for a lot of years uh
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
if if it applies for the commercial side
 
00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
of our driver's licenses I don't
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
understand why it wouldn't apply to
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
passenger vehicles as well to go one
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
step further if you look around the
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
planet there are a lot of countries that
 
00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:39.799 align:start position:0%
that that actually have their street
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
signs in multiple languages if we think
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea to have people that
 
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
cannot speak an ounce of English driving
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
in this the state then perhaps we should
 
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%
put a bill in next year to put it
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
separate language or language is on
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
every street sign in New Hampshire then
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
that takes this whole argument
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
away um again I mentioned is already in
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
statute uh just that language is is
 
00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
recognized as our official language in
 
00:50:05.309 --> 00:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and as of yesterday uh by
 
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:08.599 align:start position:0%
executive action it is now the language
 
00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
recognized by the federal government uh
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that for now again this
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
is common sense this has got nothing to
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
do with racism it's got nothing to do
 
00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.270 align:start position:0%
do with racism it's got nothing to do
with

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:21.640 align:start position:0%
xenophobia uh and I really enjoyed these
 
00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
emails this truly is common sense so
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
that being said any any body else from
 
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.910 align:start position:0%
that being said any any body else from
the

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:33.640 align:start position:0%
pataro thank you Mr chair I just wanted
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
to Echo the last bullet point you made
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
that um one of the legal concerns I did
 
00:50:43.069 --> 00:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
have at the time of our hearing was that
 
00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:45.319 align:start position:0%
again the United States federal
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
government didn't have an official
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
language at that time over the past
 
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks our president and
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
administration did make English the
 
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
official language of this country and
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
that does have profound ramifications
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
such as something like this bill So
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
Satisfied I um just wanted to add
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
that um anybody else from the committee
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative Miller thank you Mr
 
00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.549 align:start position:0%
representative Miller thank you Mr
chairman

00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
um I could not disagree with you more uh
 
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
on the reasoning the justification or
 
00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
the value that this bill
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
brings um citing commercial regulations
 
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
and suggesting that should apply to
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
personal driver's licensees
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
non-commercial is a red herring um of
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
absurd proportions there are several
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
things that apply to commercial drivers
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
that do not apply to personal drivers
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
that there's a reason we have different
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
licenses for them suggesting that a
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
federal commercial license policy should
 
00:51:47.549 --> 00:51:47.559 align:start position:0%
apply to a regular driver's license uh
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
at the State of New Hampshire level
 
00:51:52.349 --> 00:51:52.359 align:start position:0%
is an
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
unreasonable uh let's say approach to
 
00:51:59.470 --> 00:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
um I would dispute that the problem with
 
00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:04.839 align:start position:0%
people driving the wrong way on the
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
interstate is because they can't read
 
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:07.870 align:start position:0%
interstate is because they can't read
these

00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.589 align:start position:0%
these
signs

00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
signs
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh there are Myriad indicators
 
00:52:16.789 --> 00:52:16.799 align:start position:0%
associated with Street navigation road
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
navigation it is not just the words on
 
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
the sign a stop sign is a stop sign
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
because it is a red octagon with a white
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
border on it it is not a stop sign
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
because it has the word stop written
 
00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
stop in the middle of it if any of us
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
went to France and were driving in
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
France or the French Caribbean islands
 
00:52:36.789 --> 00:52:36.799 align:start position:0%
or anywhere else where France is the
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
native language and saw a red octagon
 
00:52:42.589 --> 00:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
with a white border on it that said a RR
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
e with a little hat on it t we would
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
know that that is a stop sign despite
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that it has the word aret
 
00:52:50.829 --> 00:52:50.839 align:start position:0%
written there Canada to they do it there
 
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
um Quebec at least uh right a one-way
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
sign is not a one-way sign because it
 
00:52:58.589 --> 00:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
says oneway in the middle of it it's a
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
oneway sign because it's a black sign
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
with a white arrow pointing that
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
direction do not enter all of these
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
signs are pictograms for the precise
 
00:53:11.069 --> 00:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
reason that language is not
 
00:53:11.079 --> 00:53:13.750 align:start position:0%
reason that language is not
Universal

00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
Universal
 
00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
we finally I will only note that we have
 
00:53:19.789 --> 00:53:19.799 align:start position:0%
heard from the Department of Safety that
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
having these multiple language uh tests
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
available has in fact enabled people to
 
00:53:32.829 --> 00:53:32.839 align:start position:0%
safely and reasonably acquire a license
 
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
to participate in our society and while
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
you may want everyone to speak English
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire or in the United
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
States that is quite frankly is a
 
00:53:45.359 --> 00:53:46.710 align:start position:0%
States that is quite frankly is a
xenophobic

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
xenophobic
 
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
approach it is not a reasonable
 
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
expectation um whether on a temporary or
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
permanent basis people are here and they
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
will speak other languages as well our
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
goal should be to meet our constituents
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
and Community where they are and help
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
them to ensure that they have a safe
 
00:54:02.829 --> 00:54:02.839 align:start position:0%
environment and they can safely
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
participate in our society not exclude
 
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
them for the sake of a language thank
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
you sorry one last bit we've already
 
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
paid the money there's no sense in
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
throwing away something we've already
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
paid for you want to talk about wasting
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars we've already paid for
 
00:54:18.789 --> 00:54:18.799 align:start position:0%
this throwing it away at this point is a
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
you well first of all we've actually had
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
somebody as I mentioned from the of
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
safety recognize the language is a
 
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
barrier and with that I ask you a
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
question uh do you know how to to read
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
caution black eyes ahead in
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
Swahili probably not and so I would
 
00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
suggest that somebody that speaks
 
00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
Swahili would not be able to read
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
caution black eyes ahead in English
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
either we do have our our changeable
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
safety signs all over the state I I do
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
consent that language is important uh I
 
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
see representative Hill thank you Mr
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
last week I spent the weekend the azors
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
um I do not speak
 
00:55:02.559 --> 00:55:04.630 align:start position:0%
um I do not speak
Portuguese

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
Portuguese
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
um after riding around on on tours on
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
the tour bus I asked my wife
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh to conduct a little game with me if
 
00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
we would um have driven the same way the
 
00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
tour bus did and there were more times
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
when they had the pictogram up that we
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
had no clue what the hell they were
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
saying in the pictogram um for that
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
reason we declined to rent a car when
 
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
the tours ended um it was just not safe
 
00:55:42.349 --> 00:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
in my estimation so I have to believe
 
00:55:45.069 --> 00:55:45.079 align:start position:0%
the reverse is true um that when people
 
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
come here that uh that speak a language
 
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
other than what our signs are in um that
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
too is is unsafe unsafe for them as well
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
as for um the motoring public uh that
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
does understand the the uh language um
 
00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:06.799 align:start position:0%
on our signs so for that reason I'll be
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
461 represent
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
SES thank you Mr chairman so several
 
00:56:22.829 --> 00:56:22.839 align:start position:0%
points that I would like to make one um
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
I've said this before and I think I and
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
I'll say it again um ours is an aging
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
State and we would like I would think to
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
want to encourage persons to move here
 
00:56:38.109 --> 00:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
particularly young people
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
professionals people Etc in the last
 
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
senses for the first time in many
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
decades New
 
00:56:48.029 --> 00:56:48.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire achieved a positive rate of
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
population growth that's significant and
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
is important because because of who's
 
00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
going to take care of of us as we age
 
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
who's going to do the hard manual labor
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
who's going to do the health care needs
 
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
who's going to do there's a whole
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
variety of industries that depend on uh
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
labor from for these people who are
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
coming in and high-tech companies of
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
which is the one of the foundational
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
successes of the uh New Hampshire uh
 
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
Advantage quote unquote um because those
 
00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:27.559 align:start position:0%
high-tech companies are hiring people
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
who come from other places to to live
 
00:57:34.109 --> 00:57:34.119 align:start position:0%
and work even if it's
 
00:57:37.029 --> 00:57:37.039 align:start position:0%
temporarily many of them often decide to
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
stay in any event um my personal
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
experience has been that uh I've driven
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
in multiple countries and
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
um I felt re reasonably safe in fact
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
very safe because
 
00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
most s most not all but most signs are
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
in fact pictograms throughout the world
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
there are exceptions to that of course
 
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
so I view this bill as
 
00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.230 align:start position:0%
so I view this bill as
um

00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
discriminatory I view it as a waste of
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars I view it as an
 
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
anti-business bill because it will make
 
00:58:19.789 --> 00:58:19.799 align:start position:0%
it harder for companies to recruit the
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
PE the very people who are filling the
 
00:58:26.349 --> 00:58:26.359 align:start position:0%
Gap to provide labor
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
residents who are younger people who are
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
really invested in their Community um
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
why would we do that why would we disarm
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
ourselves so to speak by passing a a
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
bill that will just make it more and
 
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
more difficult for people to come here I
 
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
me represent P thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
my opposition to this bill is based on
 
00:58:59.069 --> 00:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
conversation I had with my neighbor he's
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
an he's a retired executive from Bae and
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest problems they're
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
having what they've had in the last 10
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
years is getting the scientists they
 
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
need to come in from overseas or the
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
graduates the foreign graduates even
 
00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
though many of the scientists speak very
 
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
good English and are fully capable of of
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
reading any kind of sign they have
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
family that may not um they don't feel
 
00:59:27.309 --> 00:59:27.319 align:start position:0%
comfortable here they they uh
 
00:59:29.789 --> 00:59:29.799 align:start position:0%
the they understand the pictograms they
 
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
understand the signs they understand how
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
to drive the the most of the things we
 
00:59:35.029 --> 00:59:35.039 align:start position:0%
use are Universal although Europe has
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
standardized it far more than we have um
 
00:59:41.549 --> 00:59:41.559 align:start position:0%
U so to me I agree with with
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative syes that this is would
 
00:59:45.789 --> 00:59:45.799 align:start position:0%
be an anti-business Bill and it would
 
00:59:47.309 --> 00:59:47.319 align:start position:0%
communicate to the world that New
 
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is closed to any kind of tech
 
00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
business because a very large number of
 
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
of tech scientists are not native americ
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know not not
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh native English speaking
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.309 --> 01:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
so I like I don't need to repeat the
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
other things that were already said so
 
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh I guess I'll just leave it at
 
01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
that hold on hold on we're GNA go around
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
the room first before I do repeats
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski thank you Mr
 
01:00:20.559 --> 01:00:23.150 align:start position:0%

um for many people in this room who were
 
01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:27.990 align:start position:0%

here
 
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
last uh last year um they know the story
 
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
that I recently found some family down
 
01:00:35.119 --> 01:00:35.990 align:start position:0%
that I recently found some family down
in

01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
Poland and they one they have done a lot
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
of work with you know with the refugees
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
from Ukraine uh
 
01:00:47.029 --> 01:00:47.039 align:start position:0%
Ukraine but I've gotten to know them and
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
they've filled in a lot of my family
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
history my father died very young he
 
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
came from Poland he was picked up by the
 
01:00:58.990 --> 01:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
German Army and was forced to in a forc
 
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.430 align:start position:0%
German Army and was forced to in a forc
labor

01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
labor
 
01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
camp to make food for the
 
01:01:07.829 --> 01:01:07.839 align:start position:0%
Germans my father came to this
 
01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:11.240 align:start position:0%
country and started a
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
life and as I was growing
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
up you know I asked my mom like how come
 
01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:21.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have a car how
 
01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
come dad doesn't
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable driving because he didn't
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
know our
 
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
language and he was more concerned with
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
making sure that if he got behind a
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
wheel that myself my brother my mom my
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
family were
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
English and when he did that's when he
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
went to get his license
 
01:01:58.990 --> 01:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
to drive a
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
car and he felt very proud to know that
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
now he was behind the
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
wheel protecting his
 
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
family so when people say because I
 
01:02:15.069 --> 01:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
support this V Ma xob I'm not take
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
offense to
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
that because my father lived this I live
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
this and many of you see me with this
 
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
Bavarian jacket I I did this and got
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
this jacket when I did some business in
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
Bavaria as a homage to my father to have
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
my father with me anytime I'm here in
 
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
legislation because he died when I was
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
very young so my father lived
 
01:02:38.079 --> 01:02:39.710 align:start position:0%
very young so my father lived
this

01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
and I look back and I appreciate back
 
01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
then I didn't because I was like Dad I
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
want to go drive around let's go because
 
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
other families did that but I learned
 
01:02:52.029 --> 01:02:52.039 align:start position:0%
from my cousin in which he wrote letters
 
01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
stating the reason why that's why I'm
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
representative I haven't heard from
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
pandon yet representative pandon thank
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair my other concern with this
 
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
is listening to the the debate going on
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking weekly now I'm getting
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
a dozen to 20 handwritten letters from
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
people in the
 
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
ESL uh uh classes
 
01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
with their fears that ESL funding is
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
going to go by the wayside so if we
 
01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
can't teach
 
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
English this all seems
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
moo because
 
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's I don't know the details of it I
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
haven't uh reached out to these teachers
 
01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:50.359 align:start position:0%
in the ESL program uh in nashwa but it's
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
a it's a concern it's a fear that the
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
the funding is going to stop on the the
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
the training of this
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
so if we can't teach them how to speak
 
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
English then the it's going to be harder
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
for them to to pass drive a zed as well
 
01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
that's just my concern on this and it's
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
just something that just came to my mind
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
on the number of handwritten letters I'm
 
01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
getting so hopefully it's a valid point
 
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
representative gas thank you Mr chair so
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I want to pay
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
attention to specifically with this bill
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
is it's who we're giving a New Hampshire
 
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
driver's license to it doesn't restrict
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
anything else so you can drive on an
 
01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
international permit or a tourist permit
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
for 3 to six months anywhere in the
 
01:04:33.309 --> 01:04:33.319 align:start position:0%
United States that very state to state
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about giving
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
somebody a state ID they're expressly
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
intending to stay here so I think that
 
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
it's fair at that point to say yes you
 
01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
know you you you've got three to six
 
01:04:47.269 --> 01:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
months under your International learn
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
enough English to uh to get the driver's
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
license because you're now going to be a
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
resident here and part of transitioning
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
into a country is learning the language
 
01:04:57.309 --> 01:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
and the culture and you know you're not
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
talking about somebody who's coming out
 
01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
here for two or three month uh weeks
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking about somebody who's
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
going to be living here for an extended
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
period of time so I I support the intent
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you sir anybody else from the
 
01:05:14.269 --> 01:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
committee um I forget who was first I
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
should have written it down I'll go this
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
way pataro thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
you for recognizing me again
 
01:05:26.029 --> 01:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
um uh briefly going back to the point
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
about this always being in um Federal
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
rules and it especially pertains to
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
um the commercial Trucking industry in a
 
01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:39.549 align:start position:0%
um the commercial Trucking industry in a
sense

01:05:39.549 --> 01:05:39.559 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
um when in if you're that kind of Drive
 
01:05:44.269 --> 01:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
you're a commercial driver it's like
 
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
imperative that you literally read
 
01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
everything that happens as it's coming
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
at you it's imperative it it's important
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
for safety it's important so they can
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
navigate it's important so we can the
 
01:05:59.549 --> 01:05:59.559 align:start position:0%
State can enforce its own laws too um
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is about the DMV's testing
 
01:06:05.269 --> 01:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
materials and you know one one sense
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
that I have about about this is that we
 
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to set people up for failure
 
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
either so
 
01:06:17.269 --> 01:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
um we have a language and we have our
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
entire infrastructure configured around
 
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
that language and it should be in
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
alignment thank you
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
anybody else representative Miller thank
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to address the
 
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
body again um a few bits of comments
 
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
that have come up that I would like to
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
speak to directly uh with regard to uh
 
01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
not feeling comfortable driving with the
 
01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
pictographs in a foreign country um
 
01:06:51.269 --> 01:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
the law here would not be that you would
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
simply show up and be given a
 
01:06:57.069 --> 01:06:57.079 align:start position:0%
license the law as it exists today is
 
01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
that we provide you with the training
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
materials in the language that you
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
understand if you show if I showed up in
 
01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
a random place and the signs were all
 
01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
different I too would not want to drive
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
there but if I intended to drive there I
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
would take the course I would review the
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
materials I would learn what they
 
01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
mean hopefully in a language that I
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
actually understand and then be
 
01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
qualified to safely operate on the roads
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
so yes some signs may be different from
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
where they start these people started
 
01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
their Driving Experience but the goal
 
01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
here is to give them the opportunity to
 
01:07:40.109 --> 01:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
learn not to Simply say go at it um I
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
respect your father's decision to not
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
drive um while he felt unsafe about
 
01:07:52.029 --> 01:07:52.039 align:start position:0%
it we have changed our policies in this
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
state to allow people to learn these
 
01:07:56.589 --> 01:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
things in their native language we don't
 
01:07:58.589 --> 01:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
know if if the if it was available in
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
German I assume um or polish you brought
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
up the Varian also I wasn't sure sorry
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
um I guess from the before times of Bas
 
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
sorry uh if uh if it was available in
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
Polish would he have felt more
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
comfortable we probably don't know um
 
01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
but again making it so that residents of
 
01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are comfortable and able
 
01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
to have that experience and do so safely
 
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
means meeting our constituents where
 
01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
they are um finally uh to the point of
 
01:08:29.309 --> 01:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
people should just learn English and get
 
01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
their license um and be
 
01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
here I'm not good at foreign languages
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm probably not the best example of
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
this but I don't know anyone who can
 
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
pick up a foreign language in two months
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
and feel fluently comfortable in it that
 
01:08:47.789 --> 01:08:47.799 align:start position:0%
is a extreme expectation to have and the
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
law as it exists in New Hampshire is
 
01:08:52.269 --> 01:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
that within two months of arrival if you
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
intend to be a resident here you will
 
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
acquire a driver
 
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
license and so um the idea here is that
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
they could just learn English and get
 
01:09:05.789 --> 01:09:05.799 align:start position:0%
over it um it's not going to happen that
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
fast and in the interim period as I
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
alluded to before we are going to have a
 
01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
situation where these people cannot work
 
01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
cannot run errands cannot participate in
 
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
the businesses with our businesses or
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
for our businesses we are shunning them
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
from society by taking this approach and
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
I strongly urge you to reject removing
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
accessibility for our residents thank
 
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
you anybody
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
else represent
 
01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:36.199 align:start position:0%
Crawford so I'm I'm really torn on this
 
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%
bill because I I understand um
 
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
everybody would love to be able to speak
 
01:09:45.309 --> 01:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
English I'm I'm assuming when they come
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
to this country and when they come to
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
this state and I know in driver
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
education uh industry which I'm a part
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
of um we've tried to make it easier for
 
01:09:57.550 --> 01:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
instructors to be able to communicate
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
with their students and not all not all
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
kids coming here legally um can speak
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
the language as fluently as we would
 
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
like so I know it doesn't affect me in
 
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
my uh area because I'm like up in the
 
01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:13.719 align:start position:0%
north country and I to be honest with
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
you don't have um any I I I think in all
 
01:10:20.189 --> 01:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
the years that I've teach T Drive visit
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
like 27 years I've never had a student
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
that didn't communicate English to me I
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
didn't have it but I know that in the
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
southern part of this state it's it's a
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
problem and the instructors in the
 
01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state um were
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
asking for this type of um
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
um instruction to help them communicate
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
with their
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
students I don't know what I'm going to
 
01:10:48.189 --> 01:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
do to be honest with you so I'm I'm just
 
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
going to sit here and I I hope somebody
 
01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.270 align:start position:0%
going to sit here and I I hope somebody
else

01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
would pipe in because I I get what
 
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
chairman Walsh I respect chairman Walsh
 
01:10:59.470 --> 01:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
with all all the respect in the world
 
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
and I understand where he's coming from
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
but I don't know if I totally agree with
 
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
eliminating all of the
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
um languages that the people who want to
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
stay here and be here um if they need
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
that as a boost to get to that point of
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
understanding English and being able to
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
speak it I just don't know if we're
 
01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
taking that away so that's all I have to
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
say any any body else actually I'll ask
 
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
representative land do you still have
 
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
handy um yes let me pull that up um and
 
01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
um since you're having me speak I do
 
01:11:36.189 --> 01:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
want to note that I went to when I went
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
to Poland for my friend's wedding um one
 
01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
of the most offensive things you could
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
do there was speak German because most
 
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
of the Polish people who speak German
 
01:11:46.629 --> 01:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
did not learn it by choice
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
um sorry I know it's an decide and we're
 
01:11:51.070 --> 01:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
trying to stay focused but um here in
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
RSA 3-c colon one it says the official
 
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
language of the State of New Hampshire
 
01:11:59.629 --> 01:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
shall be English English is designated
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
as the language of all official public
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
documents and records and of all public
 
01:12:07.149 --> 01:12:07.159 align:start position:0%
proceedings and non-public
 
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
sessions thank you represent
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
s thank
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
you not withstanding
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
that I would remind everybody that many
 
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
countries have official
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
languages but in those
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
countries often times the majority of
 
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
the public speak a different language it
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
and what we're what we don't want to do
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
is use that as a tool to keep people
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
from advancing in their life and
 
01:12:45.719 --> 01:12:47.229 align:start position:0%
from advancing in their life and
integrating

01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
integrating
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
into um a
 
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
population and being productive members
 
01:12:56.669 --> 01:12:56.679 align:start position:0%
of society and this
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
right now again I would reiterate um the
 
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
point that this allows people it helps
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
people to learn so that they can take a
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
test and gain the driver's privileges
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
that they are required to have if
 
01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to remain here as
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
residents so I I think we just need to
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
know I my experience for
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
instance and we've talked a lot about
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
that that but um one of the countries
 
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
that I worked in for several years
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
actually the official language was
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
French 90% of the population did not
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
speak French and yet they
 
01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
all actually drove quite safely um and
 
01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:48.679 align:start position:0%
had no greater accident rate than we do
 
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
here in the United States um because I
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
was curious about that and asked
 
01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:56.030 align:start position:0%
was curious about that and asked
actually

01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
anybody else ripson blon uh thank you Mr
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
chairman um actually my friend who was
 
01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
married in Poland grew up in Poland and
 
01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
she came to the United States as a child
 
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
and she learned English very quickly I
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
think the idea that people can't learn
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
English I understand it's a difficult
 
01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
language but I also think it's a bigotry
 
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
of low expectations to tell people that
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be able to learn
 
01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
English so we're not going to expect
 
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
that of you um I I think that high
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
expectations are good and um I'm I'm
 
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
always concerned when people are othered
 
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
and people suggest that they can't learn
 
01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
things and they're not as smart as
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
native Native English speakers that
 
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
always bothers me because that's really
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
else go ahead representative Miller
 
01:14:48.669 --> 01:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
thank you m Mr
 
01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
chairman uh no one is suggesting that
 
01:14:54.510 --> 01:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
learning English can't be done um or
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
that it's imp possible to do or that
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
anyone who is trying to learn English is
 
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
dumber or less capable than anyone else
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
the point made is that doing it in two
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
months to a level of fluency that allows
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
you to take a driver's
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:17.229 --> 01:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
unreasonable anybody
 
01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
else representative pataro um thank you
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
once again Mr chair um uh before I say
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
what I want to say just
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
ress this is about the training
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
materials but um if since we're all on
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
the topic of um this very fascinating
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
subject is it is in my belief that um
 
01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
anybody on the planet learning English
 
01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
does nothing but to boost their um
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities when it comes to improving
 
01:15:47.790 --> 01:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
themselves or their economic
 
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities or anything um English is
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
a very very important language not just
 
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire the United States
 
01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.070 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire the United States
but

01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
globally it is and I I reject the notion
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
that just because you need to speak
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
English here that somehow if you can't
 
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to be shunned from society
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh my grandparents my M and pepe
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
actually came here they couldn't speak a
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
word of English and they actually M
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
melted into society very easily so uh
 
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the committee I know
 
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
we're anything new on on the bill
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
itself well okay
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
now for the good news this bill is open
 
01:16:30.189 --> 01:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
for further
 
01:16:33.629 --> 01:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I have an
 
01:16:37.149 --> 01:16:37.159 align:start position:0%
amendment because this bill deals with
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
the the training and testing materials
 
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
and you can thank somebody for emailing
 
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
me and reminding me that well this has
 
01:16:47.189 --> 01:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
nothing to do about with translators so
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
this bill this amendment will deal with
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
translators I'll give you a few minutes
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
to pass it out and read it and we can
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
give up your office yep no you know what
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
fair enough um It's been a it's been a
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
lengthy debate we have a fresh amendment
 
01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
to look at uh we will take a break um

Gorski thank you Mr chairman um I move

01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
H for
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
consideration okay so amendment 0471 has
 
01:35:05.149 --> 01:35:05.159 align:start position:0%
been moved is there a second seconded by
 
01:35:07.470 --> 01:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
represent Hamlin thank you sir I'll take
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
over for
 
01:35:11.229 --> 01:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
you uh this amendment actually was an
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
unintentional Omission from the original
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
bill um again with the original bill
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh testing materials training and
 
01:35:29.310 --> 01:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
testing materials um but in hindsight
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
looking back at it when you allow
 
01:35:34.109 --> 01:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
translators in-person translators or
 
01:35:36.910 --> 01:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
using apps or even computer
 
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
programs um it's actually even worse
 
01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
than than the the training itself now
 
01:35:43.229 --> 01:35:43.239 align:start position:0%
you're you're just helping somebody get
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
through the test knowing full well that
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
they have no grasp of the English
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
language and I know we talked about the
 
01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
the pictogram science that are the
 
01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
common ones for stop and One Way etc etc
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
but there were so many more things on
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
the roads that require somebody in my
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
opinion for complete safety to be able
 
01:36:03.070 --> 01:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
to read including directional signs um
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
you see it now um you know people don't
 
01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
can't read the sign or don't understand
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
the sign the first thing they do is lock
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
up the brakes they don't look for a
 
01:36:13.629 --> 01:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
place to pull over it's it's it's our I
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
guess and all I'm trying to say is our
 
01:36:17.070 --> 01:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
roads we can all see with our own eyes
 
01:36:18.990 --> 01:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
are not getting safer nowadays they're
 
01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit more treacherous
 
01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
and why we don't do what we can do to at
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
least dress one of the reasons for it um
 
01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:29.320 align:start position:0%
I think would be a mistake so so I offer
 
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment and again it's pretty
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
simple um it just uh amends I would say
 
01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
263 6E paragraph 5 uh you can read for
 
01:36:41.550 --> 01:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
yourselves you don't need me to go
 
01:36:43.470 --> 01:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
through it one at a time to make sure
 
01:36:44.709 --> 01:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
that those things are not allowed in
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
this whole process either in terms of
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
translators as I said with translation
 
01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
apps computer programs Etc it still does
 
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
allow devices to use and Aid in people
 
01:36:57.310 --> 01:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
with hearing or seeing the English
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
language or seeing American Sign
 
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
Language those those are not affected
 
01:37:02.669 --> 01:37:02.679 align:start position:0%
and still shall be shall still be
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
permitted so um that's what the
 
01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
amendment does I'll open it up to the
 
01:37:12.669 --> 01:37:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:15.629 --> 01:37:15.639 align:start position:0%
committee representative SES thank you
 
01:37:19.229 --> 01:37:19.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so it's my considered
 
01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
opinion that this amendment um
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
particularly the first piece of
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
removing uh an in-person
 
01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:31.350 align:start position:0%
removing uh an in-person
translator

01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
translator
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
um makes the
 
01:37:37.149 --> 01:37:37.159 align:start position:0%
bill more egregious than its original
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
version and my question to the committee
 
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
and to the members as we Ponder the the
 
01:37:47.589 --> 01:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
incredible significance of what we're
 
01:37:50.589 --> 01:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
doing here today
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
is when will we stop who will we then
 
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
who is next on that list to be um having
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
more difficulty to to ACH achieve the
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
privilege of driving I I worry about
 
01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:07.350 align:start position:0%
privilege of driving I I worry about
that

01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
significantly um I think that this is
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
just we're going down a we're going down
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
a road that I don't think is uh is
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate or
 
01:38:20.189 --> 01:38:20.199 align:start position:0%
sustainable uh in the long run for the
 
01:38:24.109 --> 01:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
economic and uh for the the economic
 
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
health for the uh strength of our
 
01:38:31.229 --> 01:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
society for the strength of the vision
 
01:38:33.470 --> 01:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
that is the United States which is to be
 
01:38:36.589 --> 01:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
open and welcoming to as many people as
 
01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%
we can and I I just I can't support the
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
amendment nor can I and even with the
 
01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
amendment nor could I support the
 
01:38:51.390 --> 01:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
bill ripson gon thank you Mr chair in
 
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment I I actually
 
01:38:57.109 --> 01:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
I favor it um for one reason and that's
 
01:38:59.790 --> 01:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
safety um I was talking with with a
 
01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
State Trooper on the break and you know
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
and I asked the question what does it
 
01:39:05.950 --> 01:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
mean when you pull somebody over that
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
your officer can't communicate with and
 
01:39:11.470 --> 01:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
the the the basic answer that I got was
 
01:39:13.109 --> 01:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
more time on the side of the road which
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
exposes both the civilian and the
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
officer to higher risk of a road strike
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
or anything else while the officer has
 
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
to use some kind of a translator and
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
that it lengthens stops um so again
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking about who we give instate
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
licenses to not not Travelers Not
 
01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0%
tourists not instate licenses and if
 
01:39:31.950 --> 01:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
we're giving instate licenses to people
 
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
who can't basically verbally communicate
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
in English especially at the side of the
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
road um on a routine traffic stop or you
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
know forbidden accident um we're
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
creating a barrier that will lengthen
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
the amount of time again that there is
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
exposure to traffic both for our law
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers and for those
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
civilians anybody El
 
01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
raro thank you Mr chair um across
 
01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
entire Industries and spectrums there's
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
um certifications examinations and you
 
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
know the DMV Proctors the examinations
 
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
for the license and um there are other
 
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.589 align:start position:0%
for the license and um there are other
aspects

01:40:15.589 --> 01:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
aspects
 
01:40:15.599 --> 01:40:17.149 align:start position:0%
aspects
that

01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:17.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
we legislate and oversee and so forth
 
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
but but we want to make sure that um
 
01:40:27.669 --> 01:40:27.679 align:start position:0%
they're able to Proctor these exams
 
01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
correctly this amendment lists several
 
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
things and we also want to make sure
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
that none of these things that could be
 
01:40:40.510 --> 01:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
allowed could be used for any nefarious
 
01:40:42.750 --> 01:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
cheating let's say on the
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
examination so I think we need to um
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
consider that as well thank
 
01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
you anybody
 
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
else one thought represent SES thank you
 
01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:57.310 align:start position:0%
else one thought represent SES thank you
um

01:40:57.310 --> 01:40:57.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:59.790 --> 01:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
actually um the problem with the last
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
minute amendments is it doesn't give
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
anybody uh a real opportunity
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
to talk to their professionals who would
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
also would be responsible for
 
01:41:14.189 --> 01:41:14.199 align:start position:0%
administering the program and um and I
 
01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
don't expect that to happen today and
 
01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even ask for it to happen today
 
01:41:20.669 --> 01:41:20.679 align:start position:0%
but I I I have to ask myself the
 
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
question and I would wish that you would
 
01:41:25.229 --> 01:41:25.239 align:start position:0%
ask yourselves the question would
 
01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:29.679 align:start position:0%
be during the actual driving test that
 
01:41:32.109 --> 01:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
the person has to demonstrate that they
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
are competent to receive the privilege
 
01:41:34.719 --> 01:41:36.430 align:start position:0%
are competent to receive the privilege
of

01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
driving what role does the translator
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
actually play in making that
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
determination I don't think any that
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
can't be a short answer today and I
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
don't think we have an answer and so I I
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:57.390 align:start position:0%
 
anybody

01:41:57.390 --> 01:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:42:00.589 --> 01:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
else seeing none we'll take up the
 
01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
amendment first I usually do a Voice
 
01:42:07.629 --> 01:42:07.639 align:start position:0%

01:42:10.990 --> 01:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
on the amendment I'll give the clerk a

01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
floor is U ought to pass on House Bill
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
461 as
 
01:43:27.390 --> 01:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
amended anybody care to speak on the
 
01:43:31.870 --> 01:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
U yeah you know what in summary I think
 
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
we can all recognize that part of what
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
we do here is about
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
safety we all know that we have an issue
 
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
with impairment we've been asked to go
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
to roundtables here and there with
 
01:43:56.910 --> 01:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes even the executive counselors
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
to find and address ways to deal with
 
01:44:01.149 --> 01:44:01.159 align:start position:0%
impairment we know distraction has been
 
01:44:04.669 --> 01:44:04.679 align:start position:0%
an issue for years and even us as a as a
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee a few minutes ago recommended
 
01:44:09.149 --> 01:44:09.159 align:start position:0%
not going backwards in time by making
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
distracted driving with cell phones uh a
 
01:44:15.070 --> 01:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
secondary offense uh I didn't make up
 
01:44:17.229 --> 01:44:17.239 align:start position:0%
the language barrier we all know this is
 
01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
an issue we I heard somebody say going
 
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
down the road well we've been going down
 
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
this road for four years you know
 
01:44:26.669 --> 01:44:26.679 align:start position:0%
language has always probably been an
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
issue in this country but but when when
 
01:44:31.629 --> 01:44:31.639 align:start position:0%
it's a limited thing the odds of
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
something happening are pretty low the
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
higher the number the higher the chances
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
of bad things happening and that's all
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
this build is trying to address uh one
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
step further I think the practice that's
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
being taken uh the practice that's been
 
01:44:47.310 --> 01:44:47.320 align:start position:0%
going on right now uh was not well it
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
was not done legislatively it was not
 
01:44:50.229 --> 01:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
done through this committee it was done
 
01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:52.679 align:start position:0%
through rules I assume but based on the
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
statute that we heard I'm not even sure
 
01:44:56.109 --> 01:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
if it uh if it's
 
01:44:59.790 --> 01:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
statutory so with all those things um
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
I'm um hoping you'll support House Bill
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
461 as amended and we'll try to take
 
01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:07.520 align:start position:0%

01:45:09.629 --> 01:45:09.639 align:start position:0%
roads I'll ask the clerk to call the
 
01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:11.560 align:start position:0%

01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:56.589 --> 01:46:56.599 align:start position:0%
representative pataro for a motion thank
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I move itl on House Bill
 
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
489 motion is inexpedient to legislate
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
do I have a second seconded by
 
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
representative Crawford care to speak
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
your motion sir uh yes thank you Mr
 
01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:10.629 align:start position:0%
your motion sir uh yes thank you Mr
chair

01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
um uh this bill would um
 
01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
allow volunteers to install a uh blue
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
light to their vehicles when um these
 
01:47:25.870 --> 01:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
volunteers are responding uh the reason
 
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
I believe it should be ited is because
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
blue lights
 
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
are clearly indicative of uh police
 
01:47:37.229 --> 01:47:37.239 align:start position:0%
officers and our police force um I
 
01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
understand in the past that we did make
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
changes to allow blue lights on um
 
01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicles such as ambulances
 
01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
and fire trucks to the motoring public
 
01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
there's no ambiguity with those types of
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles being uh Emer Mercy vehicles
 
01:47:58.390 --> 01:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
but when we have volunteers using their
 
01:48:01.870 --> 01:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
um day-to-day vehicles and we we already
 
01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:04.360 align:start position:0%
allow them to use the uh red lights but
 
01:48:06.750 --> 01:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
when we start using the blue lights I
 
01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:07.870 align:start position:0%
when we start using the blue lights I
feel

01:48:07.870 --> 01:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
feel
 
01:48:11.589 --> 01:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
that encroaches on the work that our
 
01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
police force does and um it can be very
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
confusing and frankly um distracting and
 
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
disheartening for the motoring public if
 
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
they're getting out of the way of what
 
01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
what they might be may or may not be
 
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
believed the the right kind of response
 
01:48:33.589 --> 01:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
so with that I think I think it's best
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
to just um deny this
 
01:48:39.910 --> 01:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
request well put representative pataro
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the
 
01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:43.629 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the
committee

01:48:43.629 --> 01:48:43.639 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr
 
01:48:50.350 --> 01:48:50.360 align:start position:0%
chairman um so we did recently in fact
 
01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
allow a single red light on the back of
 
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
fire trucks and there was a very good
 
01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
blue excuse me thank you a blue light on
 
01:48:59.910 --> 01:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
the back of fire trucks and there was a
 
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
very good reason for that and the reason
 
01:49:06.990 --> 01:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
was that it is a easil more easily seen
 
01:49:10.430 --> 01:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
and recognized as an emergency than red
 
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
lights which can possibly blend in with
 
01:49:16.669 --> 01:49:16.679 align:start position:0%
tail lights and so on so if we I'm going
 
01:49:18.669 --> 01:49:18.679 align:start position:0%
to keep this very brief if we
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
were if we are going to be concerned
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
about the motoring public public and
 
01:49:25.229 --> 01:49:25.239 align:start position:0%
their safety and we're going to be
 
01:49:28.510 --> 01:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
concerned particularly about
 
01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:30.109 align:start position:0%
concerned particularly about
volunteer

01:49:30.109 --> 01:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
01:49:32.750 --> 01:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
firefighters or emergency responders and
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's who this bill applies to and
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
their response
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
to uh emergency scenes when they may get
 
01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
there before the ambulance and before
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
the fire truck because they respond in
 
01:49:47.550 --> 01:49:47.560 align:start position:0%
their personal vehicles why would we not
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
now after
 
01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
having why would we not now want to
 
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
support their safety and the safety of
 
01:49:57.229 --> 01:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
public represent foot thank you Mr
 
01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I believe during our
 
01:50:02.430 --> 01:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard from a law
 
01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement official that the public
 
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
perception people will be desensitized
 
01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
to to the blue lights so I I believe uh
 
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
that also be true so I support the
 
01:50:16.870 --> 01:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
itl yeah and to that I believe it was
 
01:50:19.390 --> 01:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
last year we passed a law that would
 
01:50:21.870 --> 01:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
also prevent Uber and R share companies
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
from displaying lights as well for the
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
same reason anybody else from the
 
01:50:27.870 --> 01:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
committee representative V thank you Mr
 
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
chairman uh very quickly um I will
 
01:50:36.030 --> 01:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
probably defer to the the members of of
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
Public Safety fire um offices uh because
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
this is just a rear light and we're
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
already concerned about the safety on
 
01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
the side of the road uh we we know that
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
when they're on the side of the highway
 
01:50:51.870 --> 01:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
that Vehicles very often get crashed
 
01:50:54.030 --> 01:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
into from behind uh by people not paying
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
attention people mistaking the lights
 
01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
for for brake lights instead of uh safe
 
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
Public Safety officials um if this helps
 
01:51:05.310 --> 01:51:05.320 align:start position:0%
with visibility and helps save lives I'm
 
01:51:07.470 --> 01:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
going to support
 
01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
it anybody else from the committee and
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
just just just another thought too I

01:53:41.950 --> 01:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
motion sir uh thank you Mr chance uh so
 
01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
yes what this bill is asking is that
 
01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
when a uh police officer goes in to do
 
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
an inspection on a commercial operation
 
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh the the police officer is can do you
 
01:53:58.270 --> 01:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
know P look at the paperwork look at the
 
01:54:00.990 --> 01:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
operation but as far as doing any type
 
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
of inspection on a vehicle to make sure
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
that the vehicles are being inspected
 
01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
properly it takes a trained person and
 
01:54:11.709 --> 01:54:11.719 align:start position:0%
for this for this reason uh to be able
 
01:54:14.350 --> 01:54:14.360 align:start position:0%
to take a civilian in to do that type of
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
an operation or an inspection I believe
 
01:54:20.109 --> 01:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:31.629 --> 01:54:31.639 align:start position:0%

right
 
01:55:37.629 --> 01:55:37.639 align:start position:0%
thing I always do representative SS uh

our motion of a to pass fails 88 is
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
there a motion you know the two that we
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:58.669 --> 01:55:58.679 align:start position:0%

representative SES yeah I make a motion
to

01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
retain retains the motion do we have a
 
01:56:08.669 --> 01:56:08.679 align:start position:0%
second seconded by representative G get
 
01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
speaking motion or
 
01:56:15.069 --> 01:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
n up to you no um I ever so briefly
 
01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
would suggest that um I think this is
 
01:56:20.109 --> 01:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
another one of those questions that
 
01:56:23.870 --> 01:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
deserves um has some good points we the
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
notes in front of me have pros and cons
 
01:56:28.430 --> 01:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
it isn't you know and so maybe we need
 
01:56:30.510 --> 01:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
to look at that and have it take use
 
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
that opportunity to see if we can uh
 
01:56:38.229 --> 01:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
refine it if we can hence retain fair
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
enough anybody else from the
 
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
committee represent gon yeah I really I
 
01:56:46.589 --> 01:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
really wanted this to pass but um but
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
you know if it's if it's not going to
 
01:56:50.310 --> 01:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
pass then we should retain it the do you
 
01:56:52.030 --> 01:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
know specifically asked us to look at
 
01:56:53.390 --> 01:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
this so that they could have more
 
01:56:56.229 --> 01:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
resources for inspections and because
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
it's a civilian contractor working for
 
01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
the dot I don't think that they would be
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
less qualified than the system that we
 
01:57:05.589 --> 01:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
have in place right now so it it becomes
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
an issue of Manpower so I'd rather
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
retain it and clean the language up than
 
01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:09.189 align:start position:0%
retain it and clean the language up than
kill

01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
kill
 
01:57:11.790 --> 01:57:11.800 align:start position:0%
it fair enough and I'll be honest that's
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
why I I did not vote for the aop pass
 
01:57:15.910 --> 01:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's just been my personal experience
 
01:57:17.990 --> 01:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
with the civilians that haven't been
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
inspecting these stations that I think
 
01:57:21.390 --> 01:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
we need to look at the whole the whole
 
01:57:23.790 --> 01:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
picture so retain fair enough anybody
 
01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
else from the committee seeing that I'll
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to call the rooll motion
 
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%

02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on people doing things like
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
driving riding lawnmowers when they had
 
02:00:05.149 --> 02:00:05.159 align:start position:0%
their license suspended for being a
 
02:00:06.990 --> 02:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
about doing a very bad thing like
 
02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:11.639 align:start position:0%
getting a DUI um this section of it was
 
02:00:13.470 --> 02:00:13.480 align:start position:0%
probably the most difficult part of the
 
02:00:15.629 --> 02:00:15.639 align:start position:0%
language that I wrote but a lot of
 
02:00:17.069 --> 02:00:17.079 align:start position:0%
people don't know where the actual edge
 
02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
of their property ends legally and a lot
 
02:00:21.069 --> 02:00:21.079 align:start position:0%
of people think that their property goes
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
up to their edge of their grass without
 
02:00:25.709 --> 02:00:25.719 align:start position:0%
having a definition of way that
 
02:00:28.030 --> 02:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
basically says if you mow between the
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
legal edge of your property and the edge
 
02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:33.320 align:start position:0%
of the grass um that that's acceptable
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're putting people at risk
 
02:00:37.350 --> 02:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
of spending seven nights in jail for not
 
02:00:39.310 --> 02:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
knowing the edge of their property or
 
02:00:41.629 --> 02:00:41.639 align:start position:0%
the property that they're mowing as a
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
landscaper um I had initially come in to
 
02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
speak on the bill the prime sponsor
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
didn't come to the hearing um I spoke um
 
02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
asking for an itl on this bill however I
 
02:00:53.069 --> 02:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
did understand that there were some
 
02:00:55.709 --> 02:00:55.719 align:start position:0%
concerns um from some people within the
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
agencies within the Department of
 
02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
Justice I never I asked and reached out
 
02:01:01.149 --> 02:01:01.159 align:start position:0%
I wanted to know what the specific
 
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
concerns were so that instead of killing
 
02:01:05.470 --> 02:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
the bill we could correct their concerns
 
02:01:07.589 --> 02:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
with the language I never got anything
 
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
concrete from them so I think that we
 
02:01:10.910 --> 02:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
should itl the bill but I'd like to keep
 
02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
the offer open that if we have any
 
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
language to make this more clear I will
 
02:01:17.229 --> 02:01:17.239 align:start position:0%
put in the bill next year or the year
 
02:01:19.470 --> 02:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
after that in order to make sure that
 
02:01:21.149 --> 02:01:21.159 align:start position:0%
this does what I intend and it doesn't
 
02:01:23.229 --> 02:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
have any unintended consequences of the
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
bill that's already in law um so with
 
02:01:27.069 --> 02:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
that I'd ask everybody to vote itl on
 
02:01:27.079 --> 02:01:28.350 align:start position:0%
that I'd ask everybody to vote itl on
this

02:01:28.350 --> 02:01:28.360 align:start position:0%

speaking with the uh director of the DMV
 
02:04:37.470 --> 02:04:37.480 align:start position:0%
uh the chief medical officer of the VA
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
hospital and the adant general of the
 
02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire it was determined
 
02:04:43.589 --> 02:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
it was easier and faster to move
 
02:04:46.470 --> 02:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
legislation to um fill a loophole that
 
02:04:48.669 --> 02:04:48.679 align:start position:0%
was accidentally put in by by the jail
 
02:04:51.310 --> 02:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
car last year that disqualified out of
 
02:04:52.830 --> 02:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
state healthcare providers for writing
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
for medical exceptions so this bill um
 
02:04:58.990 --> 02:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
would allow the VA to do that whereas
 
02:05:01.149 --> 02:05:01.159 align:start position:0%
many VA Health Care Providers are
 
02:05:02.669 --> 02:05:02.679 align:start position:0%
federally contracted here and they're
 
02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
not licensed by this state but licensed
 
02:05:05.870 --> 02:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
in other states in the United States to
 
02:05:07.790 --> 02:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
practice medicine in the United States
 
02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
but they're here contractually so all
 
02:05:13.790 --> 02:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
this does is patch that hole very
 
02:05:15.669 --> 02:05:15.679 align:start position:0%
quickly so that we don't end up in a uh
 
02:05:18.669 --> 02:05:18.679 align:start position:0%

executive session on House Bill 758
 
02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
and congratulations everybody that is
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
the last house
 
02:10:30.629 --> 02:10:30.639 align:start position:0%
bill uh for this year uh and we're
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
actually done prior to the deadline for
 
02:10:36.990 --> 02:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
second committee bills so what that does
 
02:10:38.950 --> 02:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
is basically give us a month off from
 
02:10:41.910 --> 02:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
committee work yeah because we we may
 
02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
see Senate bills prior to the crossover
 
02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
it doesn't happen often but it can but
 
02:10:49.310 --> 02:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
it's usually very few so I see no need
 
02:10:52.990 --> 02:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
to call us back until after crossover
 
02:10:57.189 --> 02:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
um I think we're all set on uh people to
 
02:11:00.750 --> 02:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
defend the committee reports on
 
02:11:03.629 --> 02:11:03.639 align:start position:0%
Thursday as far as reports for today
 
02:11:06.189 --> 02:11:06.199 align:start position:0%

02:11:08.109 --> 02:11:08.119 align:start position:0%
everybody to get them I I need them
 
02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
today so I don't know if you're going to
 
02:11:10.910 --> 02:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
take a lunch break and come back that's
 
02:11:13.229 --> 02:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
