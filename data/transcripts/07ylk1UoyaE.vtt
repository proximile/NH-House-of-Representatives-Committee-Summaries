foreign
 
00:15:52.689 --> 00:15:52.699 align:start position:0%
to representative Lane
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh and and representative Ward what my
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
plan is for this document the way I see
 
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
it if we we have four if we all agree on
 
00:16:03.769 --> 00:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
the content
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh and I know that that uh
 
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
representative Elaine and I do because I
 
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
Incorporated her changes from her
 
00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:12.779 align:start position:0%
helpful review of it if we agree in the
 
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
content then my plan is to talk with our
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
research assistant Christina Dyer
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
but when I spoke with her back in June
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
said she would review the report to make
 
00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:25.019 align:start position:0%
sure it was in the you know the
 
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
appropriate format
 
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh and in in drafting it I followed an
 
00:16:33.009 --> 00:16:33.019 align:start position:0%
example she sent to me of a previous
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
commission report so I think it's
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
probably pretty close
 
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
and uh and when that's done
 
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
I'll submit it to the individual who
 
00:16:46.249 --> 00:16:46.259 align:start position:0%
authorized this subcommittee our
 
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
election law chairman and member of this
 
00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.370 align:start position:0%
election law chairman and member of this
subcommittee

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative rossbury that's my plan
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
my purpose in this meeting was to see if
 
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
we could actually take a vote and agree
 
00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.850 align:start position:0%
we could actually take a vote and agree
that

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
we all well see if we all agree on the
 
00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:07.069 align:start position:0%
we all well see if we all agree on the
content

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
content
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
I'll let you take a moment and
 
00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:10.579 align:start position:0%
review it
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.679 --> 00:17:21.289 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:21.299 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
I did make one change since the uh
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
the corrections I received from
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
representative Lane
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's on page three
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
the portion that was highlighted in
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
yellow or I wasn't sure if we would have
 
00:17:38.529 --> 00:17:38.539 align:start position:0%
a chance to have a meeting
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
I deleted that and altered the following
 
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.510 align:start position:0%
I deleted that and altered the following
paragraph

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
it's basically saying we recommend but
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
using a few more words than just that
 
00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
this is uh
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's on page three of the
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
annotated copy
 
00:17:59.150 --> 00:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
one two three
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
oh and I did find one
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
typographical error on page four
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
under transparency enhancement I have a
 
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
number eight that's actually item nine I
 
00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
didn't correct that when I inserted
 
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
oh found another typo
 
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:31.510 align:start position:0%
oh found another typo
wow

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
because they're so rigorous about
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
exactly from something quotes but what
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
is meant to be quoted
 
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
yeah because I once directed a
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
philosopher I have never actually
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
how to philosopher tell me I stand
 
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.090 align:start position:0%
how to philosopher tell me I stand
correct

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
they argue their way well
 
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
either way we have a typo because I
 
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:36.020 align:start position:0%
think we need to be consistent so
 
00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:39.059 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call the comma inside the
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
quote on expenditures the typo and we'll
 
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
fix that
 
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
including an individual
 
00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:55.970 align:start position:0%
including an individual
ancestors

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
well I'm I'm thinking that
 
00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at as a list of quoted items
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
so I would say the comma goes outside
 
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
but we have one as long as it's
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
consistent and that's what I'm looking
 
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.289 align:start position:0%
consistent and that's what I'm looking
for

00:21:11.289 --> 00:21:11.299 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
English Style
 
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
no I'm not so are you telling me that
 
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
that the comma should be
 
00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:31.010 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
have you been a copy editor
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
well I I am going to take the advice of
 
00:21:50.169 --> 00:21:50.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
no I'm going to stick with my original
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
judgment I'm going to fix the one that's
 
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.370 align:start position:0%
judgment I'm going to fix the one that's
different

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:57.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
here we go I'll fix the one that's
 
00:22:00.179 --> 00:22:01.070 align:start position:0%
here we go I'll fix the one that's
different

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
I hate I don't like typos I really to
 
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.409 align:start position:0%
I hate I don't like typos I really to
test

00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:06.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:09.020 align:start position:0%
all of them
 
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
if you care let's have an informal see
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
if we have a consensus here what's your
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
view on this representative Elaine
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
you don't care I
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
really don't care as long as they're
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
consistent well I have I have
 
00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
reports on the Statue I have I have two
 
00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
people I have two people here who care
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
and two of us who don't so I'll go with
 
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
the I'll uh respect the wishes of those
 
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
who care okay
 
00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.630 align:start position:0%
who care okay
so

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.529 --> 00:22:48.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.549 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
okay would you say that again I've got
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
treasurer so
 
00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I just said as far as the
 
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
general principles go I think we're
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
there I think it's more of a cleaning up
 
00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.450 align:start position:0%
there I think it's more of a cleaning up
yep

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
and when you send it to
 
00:23:53.039 --> 00:23:54.710 align:start position:0%
and when you send it to
um

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
Christina Christina
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
okay I have one question I'd like your
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
okay on page three under structure of
 
00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.330 align:start position:0%
okay on page three under structure of
report

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
the second paragraph
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
where it states following ideas and
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
suggestions and the next line down by
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote
 
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
should I
 
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
do we need to put in the actual vote no
 
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
it's four to zero the other two members
 
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
aren't here or can I just leave it as
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
it was a unanimous vote of those of us
 
00:24:56.049 --> 00:24:56.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.450 --> 00:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
might be interested to know that the
 
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
Republican chair of the subcommittee the
 
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
ranking minority member
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
where I'm at the same side yes okay so
 
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
can I like you would agree with just
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
leaving it as unanimous vote without
 
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
bear with me a moment okay move by
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative mirrorhead seconded by
 
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative Ward
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
if there's no further discussion I will
 
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
ask for a vote all in favor
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
say aye
 
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:24.900 align:start position:0%

00:26:32.279 --> 00:26:34.070 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
that concludes the business I had
 
00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
is there any other business anyone on
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee would like to discuss
 
00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.169 --> 00:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
how much fruit did we leave on the tree
 
00:26:59.390 --> 00:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
I know that we we went for the really
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
low experience we went for the things
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
that were easy to not easy to fit that
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.769 --> 00:27:24.779 align:start position:0%
think I covered that you may disagree
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to include the write-ups
 
00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:30.740 align:start position:0%
that we got from
 
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
secretary Scanlon and attorney Fitch
 
00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:36.419 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
the job that the the write-up that uh
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state Aaron
 
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
Hennessey provided with us and the
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
write-up we got from the two
 
00:27:48.289 --> 00:27:48.299 align:start position:0%
representatives from the Attorney
 
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
General's office I'm including those as
 
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.430 align:start position:0%
General's office I'm including those as
appendices

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
appendices
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
and for that very reason because I think
 
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
they captured a lot of useful things
 
00:27:59.390 --> 00:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
that and I say that in the report that
 
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
they're they're worthwhile ideas we're
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
not endorsing them but they're
 
00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
worthwhile ideas that contribute to the
 
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
discussion of how to improve the
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance system so I think I
 
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
covered that would you agree
 
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.950 align:start position:0%
covered that would you agree
yeah

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.529 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:15.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
all right so if I was just say one thing
 
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
that I did is I put in an LSR right yep
 
00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:27.260 align:start position:0%
for the one that I drafted that you that
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
representatively didn't want to be
 
00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:30.059 align:start position:0%
included in because he hadn't had a
 
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
chance to really look at it and and it
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
was intended to catch those you know
 
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
just the things that we agreed on it was
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
not intended to
 
00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:43.799 align:start position:0%
um to go further than things that that
 
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
we had but it was an extensive effort
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if I caught everything
 
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.149 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if I caught everything
so

00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
um it I haven't gotten the LSR back yet
 
00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
but when we do I I think we need I will
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
need to and others will need to go
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
through it very carefully because once
 
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
you start changing these definitions it
 
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
affects so many things different things
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
and even though I had this search you
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
know image search thing engine you can
 
00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:13.400 align:start position:0%
search for the term
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's just hard to catch them all and
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
figure it figure it all out
 
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
and the one thing that we I don't think
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
that we did discuss was what we wanted
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
to do about the change and what the
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
Senate Finance or what what was in the
 
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
budget when they changed that to un
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
we didn't really talk about that or
 
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
whatever so I think you know I just left
 
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
it as it was in the LSR because we
 
00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:42.059 align:start position:0%
hadn't really talked about it and I
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
thought when we get to it
 
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
when we have it before us in the
 
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
committee we can talk about what we want
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
to do because we never really I mean in
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
passing we talked to me we never reached
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
any consensus I don't think
 
00:29:59.330 --> 00:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
we barely talked about it all but it
 
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
basically came very late I mean it was
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
early July when we did the budget and we
 
00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:06.299 align:start position:0%
never really had a chance to talk about
 
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
it as a subcommittee
 
00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
so so that I just want to let right now
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
that that's out there and when I get it
 
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
back from them I'll circulate it and and
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
let everybody look at it and
 
00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:21.059 align:start position:0%
um and then we can kind of
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
see what we want to do with it whether
 
00:30:22.919 --> 00:30:24.350 align:start position:0%
see what we want to do with it whether
it's

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:27.419 align:start position:0%
but it was um
 
00:30:27.419 --> 00:30:29.110 align:start position:0%
but it was um
tedious

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
tedious
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
I think it's the word I did want to say
 
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
something to you no reason not to say it
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
in a public context that I do understand
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
and personally and and appreciate the
 
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
work you did on it and how much work it
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
was and my request not to be a a
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor was was exactly what you said
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
I just it's there were so many changes
 
00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
in it I would need a considerable amount
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
of time to go through it and understand
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
all the implications maybe it's an
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
engineer thing I don't know but it's a
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
lawyer thing it's so that was the only
 
00:31:06.889 --> 00:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
reason really and and the couple of
 
00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
items where I had some disagreement that
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
you know that I mentioned uh I think
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
those could be resolved let's with more
 
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.130 align:start position:0%
those could be resolved let's with more
discussion

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:31:18.169 --> 00:31:18.179 align:start position:0%
uh so I
 
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
know I just want to make sure you
 
00:31:21.409 --> 00:31:21.419 align:start position:0%
understand I really did appreciate it
 
00:31:24.289 --> 00:31:24.299 align:start position:0%
and understand the work you put into it
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
I may be coming to Aaron
 
00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
in the Secretary of State's office for
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
some help but uh because it's pretty
 
00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
far-ranging and I I'm a really nervous
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
about unintended consequences and I then
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's really what
 
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
I was uh yeah kind of driven by
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
so okay okay
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
well if we have no other business then
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
I'll we'll conclude the meeting uh I do
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
want to say that I enjoyed working with
 
00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.850 align:start position:0%
want to say that I enjoyed working with
with

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
the other members of the subcommittee
 
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
I think we we did find
 
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
some areas of real agreement that were
 
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
bound to be some
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
right we've both been through the the
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
RSA 664 enough that we knew there were
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
areas we would you know agree on what
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
representative mirrorhead called the
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
low-hanging fruit but I think that's a
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
good place to start and it and it and
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
it's not the end of the process to spell
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
them out
 
00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
and I also appreciated the interest we
 
00:32:30.169 --> 00:32:30.179 align:start position:0%
saw from some members of the public
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
and it's it's good to know that there's
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
some interest out there
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
and also uh deputy secretary Hennessy
