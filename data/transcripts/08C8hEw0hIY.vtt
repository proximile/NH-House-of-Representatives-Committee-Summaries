to you today
 
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
senate bill 36 for your consideration
 
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
a very good bill at that this
 
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
is this is a recommendation
 
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
from the insurance department and this
 
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.950 align:start position:0%
from the insurance department and this
bill

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
would remove the requirement that
 
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.710 align:start position:0%
would remove the requirement that
applicants

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
applying for automobile coverage do not
 
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
sign the statement of residency
 
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
it's an outdated requirement that
 
00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 align:start position:0%
they're looking to
 
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
that's it there's not much to it
 
00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 align:start position:0%
um as you know most uh
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
most times when i apply for or
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
get new coverage for my automobile i do
 
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
it over the phone i never even go
 
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
into the insurance office and it's the
 
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.990 align:start position:0%
into the insurance office and it's the
requirement

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
that really doesn't need to be um
 
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
on our books anymore
 
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
well i guess this again shows how old i
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
will i am because i remember when this
 
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
law was created
 
00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
and it was created because the problem
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
of people in out of state
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
coming up and trying to get auto
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
insurance in new hampshire
 
00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
so i i assume that the bookkeeping or
 
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
regulating and forcing this was more
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
problems than it's worth
 
00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason why i would assume
 
00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
you're correct
 
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative and um
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
obviously you have a long background and
 
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge on the institution
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
and we'll see fit to guide this through
 
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
your committee
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
right well remembering that
 
00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
all that you sent over to us will be
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
coming before
 
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
me yes that's for sure
 
00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 align:start position:0%
uh representative van houten has a
 
00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.270 align:start position:0%
uh representative van houten has a
question

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh good morning question to you mr chair
 
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
will the insurance company be testifying
 
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
because despite the clarity of what the
 
00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
senator has just presented
 
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
i find the wording to maybe be a little
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
bit difficult
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
to showcase that clarity uh
 
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
i would say do i have i should
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
i believe they will be testifying today
 
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.950 align:start position:0%

uh i'm sorry do we have another hand max
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
did you
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
represent abramson did you have a
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
question for senator french
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
yeah is it not sure this is
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
correct or not that is it a problem with
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
somebody who
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
maybe not somebody who's out of state
 
00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
somebody who lives here but hasn't
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
been able to establish residency here
 
00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
yet when i first moved here uh
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of different steps if
 
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
you hadn't taken a particular order it's
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
about if they
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
somebody is moving here buying auto
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
insurance before they get to new
 
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.070 align:start position:0%
insurance before they get to new
hampshire

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh this requires that your vehicle is
 
00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:12.629 align:start position:0%
uh this requires that your vehicle is
garaged

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
garaged
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire exclusively garage
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
so i i guess when you get here you can
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
so all right when i move or i should say
 
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.550 align:start position:0%
so all right when i move or i should say
follow-up

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
further question main claire when i
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
moved here i i just bought a car
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
and uh because it was a brand new car i
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
moved here actually drove here
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
almost 20 years ago and i didn't have
 
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:39.990 align:start position:0%
almost 20 years ago and i didn't have
insurance

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
and i didn't have really anything on the
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
car other than the bill of sale
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
um i wonder if it just makes more sense
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
in general just to say you know if
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
you're moving here if your intent is to
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
move here
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
you're eventually going to have the car
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
garage here the
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
right buy insurance if you see fit make
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
what's that okay uh thank you very much
 
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.470 align:start position:0%
what's that okay uh thank you very much
senator

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chair we'll call on mr fox
 
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.230 align:start position:0%
thank you chair we'll call on mr fox
from

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
the department of insurance
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon good morning my name
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
is james fox and i'm the property
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
counseling director
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire insurance
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
department uh
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
as a chairman hunt and uh senator french
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
said um
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
that this is uh in essence really how
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
the department sees a modernization bill
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
um this form has been in place for a
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
while it was originally in place
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
due to uh concern over rate invasion
 
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
as it's called people come to new
 
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'm from new hampshire to buy
 
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.590 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'm from new hampshire to buy
insurance

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
um well i've been at the department now
 
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.630 align:start position:0%
um well i've been at the department now
for

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
nine years and um we don't have any
 
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.070 align:start position:0%
nine years and um we don't have any
issues

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
on this um so the thought process is uh
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
we've had
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
more problems uh with the form
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh because this is the only only state
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
that requires this is the state of new
 
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.389 align:start position:0%
that requires this is the state of new
hampshire

00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and we have the form is
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
pretty specific so some people can't
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements of the form who
 
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh are have an intent to stay here which
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
is really should be the standard
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
um as uh representative abramson brought
 
00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:25.910 align:start position:0%
um as uh representative abramson brought
up

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
which is the only really standard when
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
you first come to new hampshire you
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
haven't you come here and you have an
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
intense state here
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
um so the thought process from the
 
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
department's point of point of view is
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
that it would just be
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
easier to have the basic standards which
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
is you're either a
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
a resident which in the rule we view as
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
you're in new hampshire
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
and you have an intent to stay in new
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
hampshire or you're you have your
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle so if you're from a different
 
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:0%
state you leave your vehicle here
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
to have a vehicle in new hampshire that
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
that's also permissible this
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
and in that sense it really goes back to
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
basic property insurance that applies to
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
all types of insurance that
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
the location of the risk is where the
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
insurance should be purchased
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh going back to the new hampshire only
 
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.670 align:start position:0%
uh going back to the new hampshire only
issue

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
the problem from the carrier's
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
perspective is because it's only a new
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire issue
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
us they have sometimes have a hard time
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
either um like in certain instances is
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
recognizing the form so then they don't
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
recognize the form and then because of
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
the rule they send out cancellation
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
notices that shouldn't be sent out
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
so we do we have seen quite a bit of
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
that so in essence we have
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents who have to go
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
through the hassle of having
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
their insurance cancelled or threatened
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
to be canceled if they don't
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
work with the insurance company on a
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
kind of a prolonged basis
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
um and again for we haven't seen any
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
rate invasion uh
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
since i've been here uh and uh from a
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
regulatory perspective to the extent
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
that the insurance companies
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
which we think they are able to aren't
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
recognizing that certain people
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
aren't from new hampshire and shouldn't
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
be getting new hampshire insurance we
 
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.069 align:start position:0%
be getting new hampshire insurance we
can

00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
look at that from a market conduct
 
00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.430 align:start position:0%
look at that from a market conduct
perspective

00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
and require corrective actions on the
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
back end to make sure that insurance
 
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
companies are
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
catching people who might be trying to
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
get new hampshire insurance although
 
00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:10.629 align:start position:0%
get new hampshire insurance although
again

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
we haven't really seen that but that's
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
how we would generally handle that's how
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
we handle things
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
pretty much in all areas of regulation
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
so in essence
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
we're only getting rid of the form we're
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
keeping all the same standards the
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
standards aren't changing uh
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
and uh there should be a benefit
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
to consumers who maybe are getting
 
00:12:29.839 --> 00:12:30.790 align:start position:0%
to consumers who maybe are getting
canceled

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
canceled
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
and to the industry for not having to
 
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
comply uh with the rule that doesn't
 
00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:35.350 align:start position:0%
comply uh with the rule that doesn't
really

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
provide much consumer protection and i'd
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay there's an event happening this
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning mr fox thank you
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.839 --> 00:13:20.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
huh i i think connie you have to log
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
back at
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
am i okay now right okay cool
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
i understand the concept of
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
modernization and simplification that is
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
intended here
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely fine i don't
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
understand the wording um the amendment
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
the actual wording in the rsa itself has
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
always baffled me
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
but now i look at the um uh the change i
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
don't mean the amendment
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
look at the change that is requested and
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
the words at that time
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
the last three words at that time um
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
are confusing to me could you explain
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
what at that time means and if that's
 
00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.550 align:start position:0%
what at that time means and if that's
appropriate

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
yeah if you give me a second to read and
 
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:28.839 --> 00:14:32.030 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
is she still there i am is my microphone
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
okay now
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
yes okay um my the last three words
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
inserted in roman four uh are
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
at that time and there's no designation
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
like that i'm sorry i was i was in the
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
first section okay
 
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.790 align:start position:0%
first section okay
uh

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
and i apologize for the microphone issue
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
i've totally confused things and i
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
yo at that time just refers back too
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
because that's the part about the
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
exclusive garaging so the first part is
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
named insured
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
was not a resident of the state of new
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire at the time the policy
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
was issued or renewed and then
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
so that's the the general standard
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then the the exception is unless the
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
insured vehicle
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
at issue was exclusively garage in new
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire at that time
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
when they filled out the you know really
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
the application uh for the initiative
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
for the initial
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
policy or the renewal so it's basically
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
um hey you're supposed to be a resident
 
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:44.870 align:start position:0%
um hey you're supposed to be a resident
obviously

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
when you do that but the exception for
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
that is if you're you know
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
somebody from rhode island who's got a
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
house in lake center b and they leave
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
car there
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
um maybe it's a four-wheel drive they
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
don't need to be a resident if that car
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
stays in centipede uh and uh
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
every time it's you know you know the
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
policies issued or renewed basically
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
it's there
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of that
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
okay follow up please
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
i'll follow up i didn't hear that okay
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i have a puppy in the
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
background that's um
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
just had surgery um the um
 
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
the word that is confusing to me because
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
at that time seems to refer
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
to the time at which the policy is is uh
 
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:33.829 align:start position:0%
to the time at which the policy is is uh
purchased

00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
purchased
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
that it has to be garaged here at the
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
time the policy is purchased
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
i may be just um quibbling about words
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
here but
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's a reference that is bothersome to
 
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.949 align:start position:0%
it's a reference that is bothersome to
me

00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
well i mean the idea is that it says in
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
the beginning
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know at the time the policy was
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
issued or renewed
 
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
so that goes back to at the time the
 
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:54.870 align:start position:0%
so that goes back to at the time the
policies

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
issue or news so we would want the the
 
00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.629 align:start position:0%
issue or news so we would want the the
property

00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
to be in new hampshire at that time
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
um and not be like well i have some
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
intent to do it in the future so i'd
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
like to get an insurance policy for that
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's like the idea is like at that point
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
in time
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
your vehicle is exclusively garaged here
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
and now the way
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
we usually do this under the rule is
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
which if if there's some
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
you know the other piece we can do if
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
is slightly off we can always
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to have to do the
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
rule next so we can clean up any of that
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
in the rule which is more detailed
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
but the the idea is so if you uh
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
at the time you you know the policies
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
issued to you you have your
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
your car in new hampshire and then later
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
like you know two months later you've
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
decided you know what i'm not going to
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
you had the intent to have it only a
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
solution gratitude for the policy period
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
but then you decide to take it back to
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
rhode island
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
um then we would let you go which is how
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
it always works to the end of that
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
policy period and then we would expect
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
you to
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
shift to a rhode island policy so i
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
think that's kind of why we were saying
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
because we need to have a period of time
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
and it seems as though the correct
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
period of time is
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
the intent when the policy was issued or
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
when the policy renewed because that's
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
how the rule also operates
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i mean i i always find when i
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
when i write a sentence it's awkward i
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
just i just
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
shuffle it so i would you could say that
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
the the vehicles was closely garaged in
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh so it can be added you know at that
 
00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.270 align:start position:0%
uh so it can be added you know at that
time

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
the vehicle is exclusively garage in new
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire numbers move at that time
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
to the beginning of the phrase rather
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
than at the end of the phrase maybe that
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
makes you feel better
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
and it represents i think we can
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
definitely just repeat it another way to
 
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
do it is just be redund we could just
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
instead of taking out the time to say it
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
again same time
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative fargo
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair um and thank you
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
for taking the question could you speak
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
um line 20 where it says rsa for 12 18
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
relative to the exclusion of certain
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
claims in the calculation of
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
premium rights um
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
right yeah so that just um
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
is is to remove that rating issue
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
because they're they're the old
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
that uh law says claims paid so
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
so the old the current version is claims
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
paid by insurer under policy automobile
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
insurance as defined rsa 417 issued to
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
an individual determined
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
by the truth falsely had tested in the
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
statement of residency required by 4783b
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
shall not be included in the calculation
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
of premium rates filed with the
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner if such claims may lawfully
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
be efficiently be assigned to another
 
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.870 align:start position:0%
be efficiently be assigned to another
state

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh and that uh is not untrue but we
 
00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:52.789 align:start position:0%
uh and that uh is not untrue but we
don't

00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh need a uh along basically a law on
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
that since we don't have the residency
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
forms that's basically
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
the old law was saying if if you you
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
know falsely attest to a residency form
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
and you're from another state then then
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
that uh we shouldn't use that to
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
determine our
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
rate calculations for the insurance
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
company like loss
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
loss experience but again that this has
 
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:15.909 align:start position:0%
loss experience but again that this has
been

00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
a law that uh although well intended at
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
the time has not really been used
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
that i would say i can take a 4 12 18 on
 
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh signing rates to another state uh
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
that is i would say never been used
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
so it's more of an issue if we don't
 
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
need it
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay representative
 
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.390 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay representative
abramson

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
abramson
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
taking my question i guess uh
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
similar to the question i asked the
 
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.590 align:start position:0%
similar to the question i asked the
sponsor

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
um if you have a lot of times people buy
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
a car or truck
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
in order to move make the move my
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
preference would be that they
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
already have insurance
 
00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know at the time that they landed a
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
fun time coming to new hampshire
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
they did a road trip here um
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
is there a way to i guess kind of clean
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
this up so that
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
if somebody's buying a car truck and
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
then they move to new hampshire that
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
they could have that vehicle insured
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
before it gets here i mean
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
well if if you're in new hampshire um
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
you can get a policy usually what most
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
people do is they have
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
their their policy from uh you know a
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
different state and then
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
they work with the insurance company who
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
can be you know multiple states and then
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
the policy is switched to a new
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire policy
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh either when they arrive or at renewal
 
00:21:39.679 --> 00:21:40.149 align:start position:0%
uh either when they arrive or at renewal
um

00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the standard um
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
and that's the rule uh is that when
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
you're in new hampshire you're entitled
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire policy
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
yeah the way i look at that is maybe and
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
help me out if this is
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
way is that if you know the day you're
 
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
going to move
 
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire you can set up ahead of
 
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:01.830 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire you can set up ahead of
time

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
that insurance policy and say that
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
i don't normally we always say well we
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
want the policy to be active
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
today but you wouldn't said is you say i
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to be active
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
and you pick the day that you're going
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
to move
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
and so therefore the insurance uh you're
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
you don't have any lapses between you
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
two different insurance policies
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh that you've got to make sure that the
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
other policy expires on you can then
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
call them and say
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
i want my old state policy to expire
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
on the same day and i want my new policy
 
00:22:31.679 --> 00:22:32.070 align:start position:0%
on the same day and i want my new policy
to

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh take effect on that day so yes you
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
could actually get the policy
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
get it get it set up but that you it's
 
00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:40.950 align:start position:0%
get it get it set up but that you it's
the

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh you can when you get a policy you can
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
set when
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
is that would you agree mr fox yeah
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's two ways people handle it they
 
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.950 align:start position:0%
there's two ways people handle it they
either

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
um they're the people who like to just
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
let it roll out to renewal and say oh by
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
the way i'm in new hampshire
 
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh then it gets switched that time or
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
people who are more proactive and that
 
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.510 align:start position:0%
people who are more proactive and that
they

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
let their insurance company know that
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
they'll be moving to new hampshire on
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
this date and they'd like to switch to a
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire policy on that date and
 
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:09.909 align:start position:0%
new hampshire policy on that date and
then

00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
the insurance company will do that for
 
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.430 align:start position:0%
the insurance company will do that for
you

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
is that you all said representative
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
abramson uh follow-up
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
further question you may inquire um
 
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.950 align:start position:0%
further question you may inquire um
[Music]

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
you know as long as that's not your
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
first car um
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
my other question is in uh proposed part
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
four section two part four of the build
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
where it says unless the vehicle uh
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
at issue was exclusively garage in new
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
hampshire at that time
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
um i live on the border and we have
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
quite a few people who
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
their car is garaged either most of the
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
time or a lot of the time at a place in
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
seabrook or hampton
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
and then but they do have the car
 
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.990 align:start position:0%
and then but they do have the car
overnight

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
overnight
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
should this be a majority of the time or
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
enough of the time that kind of
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
justifies keeping the new hampshire
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
insurance policy
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
um some cars are some cars are garaged
 
00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:08.230 align:start position:0%
um some cars are some cars are garaged
in

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
in two different states over the course
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
of the year
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
well yeah the intent of this is um to
 
00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:15.909 align:start position:0%
well yeah the intent of this is um to
for

00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
and as for non-residents to be
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
able to purchase insurance in new
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire so that's that's the part of
 
00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.269 align:start position:0%
hampshire so that's that's the part of
the

00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
exclusive if you're a new hampshire
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
resident and you
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
have multiple um residences uh
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
you could still get a policy even if
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
you're in two different states but this
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
the intent of um the exclusive the
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
garaging in new hampshire
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
is that does go back to the the rate
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
invasion because you don't
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't want people who are against
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
jesus from rhode island for example who
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
come up a lot and then so then they say
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
oh i come here a lot and then we have to
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
start doing like counting
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh if either so the purpose of the
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
non-residence is either
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
either you have a car that's here or you
 
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.510 align:start position:0%
either you have a car that's here or you
don't

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
and i assume the word garage in the
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
definition means not necessarily in a
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
garage but that is parked
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
in a driveway oh further
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh you disappeared on me oh there you're
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
way down there okay you have further
 
00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:18.310 align:start position:0%
way down there okay you have further
questions

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
you took your hand okay what about all
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
the people who are parked
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
at the seabrook walmart
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
and they're here right now but that
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
you know they just got here when you
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
come up here
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
they expect to spend most of their time
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better if those people
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
want to buy insurance
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better just to open it up
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
and say they intend to spend
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
much of the year here shouldn't they be
 
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:46.789 align:start position:0%
much of the year here shouldn't they be
covered

00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
covered
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
shouldn't they be able to buy uh auto
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage for new hampshire
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
why does it have to be exclusively
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
they're gonna be driving around a bit
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
um people who are parked in the parking
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
lot at the walmart
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
right now who are in new hampshire a lot
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
generally insurance and for property
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
insurance in particular in all
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
areas not just auto insurance
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
is um location
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh rated and so that there would be a
 
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
concern if it were if you were really
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
an area say in massachusetts it has a
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
high incidence
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
of accidents and you had your vehicle
 
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.430 align:start position:0%
of accidents and you had your vehicle
there

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
um you know 50 of the time
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
and then you were trying to get it
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
insured in new hampshire uh
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
the the insurer rating system is based
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
on new hampshire risks not
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
on you know massachusetts risk so that
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
would in essence change
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
to a certain extent fundamentally change
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
insurance at least as new hampshire that
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
we viewed it
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
from a rating perspective in essence how
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
much we're going to how much they would
 
00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.510 align:start position:0%
much we're going to how much they would
charge

00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
right there's so the assumption is
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative that new hampshire has
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
insurance rates that are cheaper
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
than rhode island or massachusetts or
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
connecticut and i can't necessarily say
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
maine but so we we don't if those people
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
are coming up here
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh they we just assume they stick with
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
the policy they have
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
from where their residency is not
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
that they say well i spent enough time
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire i deserve and i have a
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
summer home here
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
i should deserve to have but you know
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
register my car here
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh and get the lower rates even though i
 
00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:34.470 align:start position:0%
uh and get the lower rates even though i
spend

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
spend
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
the winter in the fall and spring
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
in my home in rhode island
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
i i guess this is carryover from a
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
previous bill
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of people kind of move
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
around new england and we want to get as
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
many of those people who are on our
 
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.070 align:start position:0%
many of those people who are on our
roads

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
roads
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
with some kind of insurance rather than
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
no insurance at all one of them that
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
have their insurance in those states
 
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
everybody else's states requires them to
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
have insurance so
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
yes we agree that we wanted to have
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
insurance but we just don't want them if
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
they really
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
live in rhode island or they live in you
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
know in a lawrence mass where there
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
seems to be high
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
claims history down there we certainly
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
don't want them to
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
have a new hampshire uh in short car
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
down there
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
i mean a lot of them live in an rv you
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
know go from parking lot to parks
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh that is an interesting question i do
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
know that there there's the movie right
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
now out right the nomad movie
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh very much uh for uh
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
giving me the opportunity to
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
ask the question uh of mr fox uh mr fox
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
um i understand why
 
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
this issue would be a prob would be a
 
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:44.710 align:start position:0%
this issue would be a prob would be a
concern

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
of an insurance company uh to make sure
 
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
that they're getting the
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh proper uh proper payment
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
um uh but i'm not sure
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
why this is of concern to the state of
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire or to the insurance
 
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.190 align:start position:0%
new hampshire or to the insurance
department

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
and i wonder from your perspective if
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
you could explain again
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
why why this what
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
the problem is from the state's
 
00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.070 align:start position:0%
the problem is from the state's
perspective

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to solve here thank
 
00:29:16.159 --> 00:29:18.789 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to solve here thank
you

00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
um well i guess it depends which way
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
you're coming at this um the
 
00:29:21.919 --> 00:29:23.150 align:start position:0%
you're coming at this um the
department's

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
department's
 
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.110 align:start position:0%
department's
[Music]

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
position or the reason we're here is
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
that the form is unnecessary so
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
uh to have it uh is um
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know unneeded so there's no reason
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
to keep it so it
 
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
it kind of lowers that um requirement
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
and then from the consumer's point of
 
00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.870 align:start position:0%
and then from the consumer's point of
view

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
view
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
some particularly you'll have some
 
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
direct writers
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
and so there's no agent you can go into
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
their office and sign
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
sign a form uh so then they either try
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
to do it online
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
or they mail it out to you and ask you
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
to mail it back so you'll have certain
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
people who don't mail it back
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
and they'll get a cancellation notice
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
there are people who do mail it back
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
and then the insurance company can't
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't recognize it it goes into the
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
wrong box and then they get a
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
cancellation notice
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
um so from the department's perspective
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh i think we've determined over the
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
years that this has caused
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
more difficulties and has solved no
 
00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.029 align:start position:0%
more difficulties and has solved no
problems

00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
so it is uh an unnecessary rule
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
to keep and we'll be able to monitor it
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
we do market conduct examinations and
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
claim examinations on
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
auto insurers quite often so uh you know
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
we look through all the files and
 
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.190 align:start position:0%
we look through all the files and
samples

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
samples
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
and if we saw this was all of a sudden a
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
problem that many
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
people from other states were trying to
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
get into new hampshire for uh
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
insurance rate reasons which was the
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
reason for the form originally then uh
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
we would maybe take a different position
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
but we
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
have the nine years i've been here we've
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
examined the auto insurance companies
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
many times and looked at many claim
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
files and we've not seen any pattern
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
or even really instances of people
 
00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:08.070 align:start position:0%
or even really instances of people
trying

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
trying
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
to get into new hampshire to save um
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
what would be an extremely modest amount
 
00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:12.789 align:start position:0%
what would be an extremely modest amount
on

00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh on their insurance premiums
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
may ask a follow-up please certainly for
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
but thank thank you uh would it not then
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
be easier
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
simply to say
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
that this the the form isn't not
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
necessary i mean i
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh it just seems like we're doing a lot
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
of things in order to get rid of a form
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
here and
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
and i agree with i agree with another uh
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
member of the committee earlier who said
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
that all this
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
didn't as written it doesn't make it
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to say that so
 
00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:50.630 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to say that so
um

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.230 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
all this does in essence is we deleted
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
the form requirement
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
and then we've inserted the substantive
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
requirement for residency and uh or
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
exclusively garage so in the old days
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
it would just say sign the residency
 
00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.350 align:start position:0%
it would just say sign the residency
form

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
and then you'd look at the rule and the
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
rule had this language in it so now
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
since we're getting rid of the
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
form we take the language from the rule
 
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
we put it in
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
some of it put it in the statute so it
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
gives guidance as to
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
the substantive residency requirement
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
which isn't different than it's always
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
been so we're not we're not we're
 
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
changing nothing's changing and
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies are fully aware
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
of uh the
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
okay representative terry yes uh thank
 
00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:41.029 align:start position:0%
okay representative terry yes uh thank
you

00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman and uh mr fox
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
some of my questions have been answered
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
um in part by the question from
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
representative abel and the responses by
 
00:32:53.519 --> 00:32:54.149 align:start position:0%
representative abel and the responses by
mr

00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
mr
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
fox um it's clear to me that
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
this discussion um is ranging
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh is broadening beyond the actual
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
um request to eliminate the form
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
so uh in that spirit i would just like
 
00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.269 align:start position:0%
so uh in that spirit i would just like
to

00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
add or ask one additional question and
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
that is with respect to the monitoring
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
that the department does
 
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to compliance um
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
how many staff do you actually have that
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
are engaged in this practice
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
and how aggressive is it i believe you
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
had indicated that it's really not much
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
of a problem at all
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
so if you could address that or speak to
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
that i appreciate it
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
sure uh so we have uh what's called a
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
market conduct
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
unit uh and that has uh
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
four members and i assist and
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
they um in essence we have
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
different issues that come up and we do
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
um examinations
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
so which is uh the insurance companies
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
pay for them we go to their building
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
and uh well you know currently we do it
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
here uh
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
and then we we do a sample of files and
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
we review those files
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
and then we ensure compliance with
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law one of the forms or
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
different types of exams we do we can do
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
underwriting exams for example what do
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
we do is claims exams
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
so in this case um we do claimed exams
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
i would say yearly uh and
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know if we saw uh like i know one
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
auto insurer is coming up and if we saw
 
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:30.790 align:start position:0%
auto insurer is coming up and if we saw
this

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
you know that we've changed the law we
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
get rid of the residency form and
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
now uh people who have the
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
um seem to seem to not be from new
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire then we would catch that and
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
then we
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
we would either correct we might
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
discuss it with that insurance company
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
in what's called a trek
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
corrective action order uh and now that
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
insurance company then could say well
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
we think other insurance companies are
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
having the same problem then we might do
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
a bulletin or we might come back to
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
legislature and say okay here's
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
here's the new status and here's what we
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
think would be the best
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
fix for this so it's kind of always an
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
ongoing process
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
now lay it on top of that we also have a
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
consumer division
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
um and so if um
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
there was an issue and that's how for
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
example we determined that
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
some of the uh some of the direct
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
writers were having a little bit of
 
00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.390 align:start position:0%
writers were having a little bit of
trouble

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh recognizing the forms because we had
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
consumers call us and say
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
um i got cancelled you know i should not
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
have been canceled i've been
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire for you know my whole
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
life so that's how we caught that issue
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
so there are probably
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
multiple ways that we we catch
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh issues that are hurting consumers but
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
our team we have four dedicated people
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
plus myself and then we also have
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
additional people we can put in place if
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay follow mr pierre if i'm like sure
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr fox so uh thank you
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
so um in terms of monitoring it sounds
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
like this is an annual exercise
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
by sample by insurance company is that
 
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.390 align:start position:0%
by sample by insurance company is that
correct

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
well i guess yeah that this i should say
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
that there's another
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
layer complete layer that's that's
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
different than the new hampshire
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
we uh the insurance companies also have
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh reporting uh on a national
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
basis which would include new hampshire
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
and we have in addition to the four
 
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
people i just mentioned we also have an
 
00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.630 align:start position:0%
people i just mentioned we also have an
analyst

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
analyst
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
and the analyst agrees
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
he reviews uh all of the national data
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
and then if that national data indicates
 
00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh a problem then he'll go to our market
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
conduct chief
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
and then we'll do we'll start with an
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
investigation so for example
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
if you had an insurance company uh with
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
a very high cancellation rate
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
we would then um contact that
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
in that particular insurance company the
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
analysis team would
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
and then try to figure out why is your
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
cancellation rate so high
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
and that would be another way um to show
 
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.349 align:start position:0%
and that would be another way um to show
that

00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
um the residency form has been a problem
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
so there's def there are many ways about
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
this but there is national monitoring on
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
of insurance companies which includes
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and we get all of that
 
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:18.550 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and we get all of that
data

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
and we have an analyst here who goes
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
through all that data every year to try
 
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:22.950 align:start position:0%
through all that data every year to try
to

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
see if there are problems
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you okay uh we thank you very much
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
mr fox chair we'll now call on

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%

members of the committee uh i am jim
haydem

00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
haydem
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
here testifying in support of this bill
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
on behalf of state farm insurance
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
company which is
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
the nations and perhaps new hampshire's
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
largest writer of
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
automobile insurance um
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
i too go back to when this law was put
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
on the books
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
in 20 2004
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
and this this law
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
was prompted by a former commissioner
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
who had a house on lake winnipesaukee
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
and after he bought it he realized that
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of his neighbors
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
were showing up on weekends in cars that
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
were registered in new hampshire
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
and after thinking about the situation
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
and talking about it he
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
he believed that there was a issue
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
relating to
 
00:38:39.599 --> 00:38:43.030 align:start position:0%
relating to
non-residents

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
registering their cars in new hampshire
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
and insuring them in new hampshire
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
and thus put this law on the books or
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
ask the legislature to put this ball in
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
since that time i've been wrestling with
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
this long behalf
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
of state farm because state farm
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
is has unique business practice that
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
goes back to the inception
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
of the company or the beginning of the
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
companies where it actually
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
issues a new policy for each vehicle
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
that you insure so if you're somebody
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
who buys a car
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
for the kids or buys a trailer
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh or buys a motorcycle every time you
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
buy another vehicle
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
an insurance other vehicle with state
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
farm that triggered a
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
residency statement that needed to be
 
00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.710 align:start position:0%
residency statement that needed to be
signed

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
signed
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
and it required the consumer to come
 
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
down to the local state farm agent to
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
sign it
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
state farm has not been able to figure
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
out how to get this
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
form uh onto some kind of electronic
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
filing or electronic signing mostly
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
because a lot of consumers don't really
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
like that and don't know how to use it
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
but the point is this is a this is a
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
a forum that is no longer necessary and
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
it remains
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
the biggest issue with the state farm
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
agents new hampshire
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
and rather than being a direct writer
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
the state farm
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
is is actually
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
has agents in new hampshire that are
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
roughly 50 or 60 of the mom and pop
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
businesses that provide state farm
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
insurance throughout new hampshire
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
so i even renewed a policy or actually
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
got a new car policy and it was
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
the customer service rep with my local
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
state farm agent actually complained
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
about the form when she asked me to sign
 
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.309 align:start position:0%
about the form when she asked me to sign
it

00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
not knowing exactly who she was talking
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
but she expressed interest and
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
excitement about
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that the legislature may do
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
away with the form
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
um and so i here testify and support all
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
these agents who are looking closely at
 
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:51.990 align:start position:0%
these agents who are looking closely at
this

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
because they would love to see his form
 
00:40:54.319 --> 00:40:55.829 align:start position:0%
because they would love to see his form
disappear

00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
disappear
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
um the the intricacy of the bill
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
and james explained it is that you know
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
when the way the law is written it
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
basically says
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
to an insurance company or to a consumer
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
if you lie
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
on this form uh you can be denied
 
00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.829 align:start position:0%
on this form uh you can be denied
coverage

00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
and that's a pretty powerful statement
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
this is telling a consumer you're not
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
going to get insurance onto your
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
under your policy so because
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
the um because this this dramatic
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
event was tied to the policy form um
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
you know the department needed to create
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
wording when eliminating the form that
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
sort of loosened it up
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
basically telling consumers you can't
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
lie about your residency
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
but they had to sort of decouple it from
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
this form
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
um it's true that this
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh to my knowledge there's no other
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
state in the new hampshire that has this
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
residency requirement on its books and
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
the full
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
statement that you do not get coverage
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
if you lie about your residency that's
 
00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.069 align:start position:0%
if you lie about your residency that's
that's

00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
a pretty powerful uh statement from the
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
legislature and i haven't researched it
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
but i've never heard it told that
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
other states have gone this far um
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you that you know in the
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
17 years that i've been
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
wrestling with this this requirement
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's only been one claim in all that
 
00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.309 align:start position:0%
there's only been one claim in all that
time

00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
that had a residency statement issue
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
that we had to deal with so over the
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
course of 17 years it only came up once
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
um and you know i think that if you take
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
a step back
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
and you think through what uh how people
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
are moving around
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
and how cars are being insured i think
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know this is a this is a requirement
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
this is a concept
 
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
that is long outdated and getting rid of
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
the forum
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
will certainly update new hampshire laws
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
to be more consumer friendly and more
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
consumer compatible
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
um and to the extent you know there's
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
other aspects of residency that need to
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
be considered
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
that that could be for a later day but i
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to support this bill
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
mostly for the benefit of the agents
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
who have to deal with it every day and
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
would very much look forward to
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
removing the form from as a requirement
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
under new hampshire law
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
so with that uh i will lend and
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
certainly answer questions if anyone has
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative mclaren has a question
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
for you um
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
yes it never really occurred to me that
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
you somebody would try to get insurance
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh to save money but what did occur to
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
me and does occur to me
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
is if i have a second residence in new
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire which for
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
a long time i did i would want to
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
register my car
 
00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire as opposed to
 
00:43:52.119 --> 00:43:53.589 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire as opposed to
massachusetts

00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh because of the sales tax that's
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's a much much bigger bite than the
 
00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.710 align:start position:0%
that's a much much bigger bite than the
insurance

00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
um how do we address that is this this
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
isn't going to
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
help us out in that if a sense if
 
00:44:06.079 --> 00:44:06.950 align:start position:0%
help us out in that if a sense if
somebody

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
in fact you know simply registers their
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
car in new hampshire to
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
avoid the sales tax how how do we get
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
i'm going to respectfully say that you
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
know there's many
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh issues that when you mention the word
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
residency it plays out in other areas
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
and there's other aspects of this
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
um and you know this this bill is very
 
00:44:31.839 --> 00:44:32.950 align:start position:0%
um and you know this this bill is very
narrowly

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
narrowly
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
tailored to the residency forum and
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think it goes beyond
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
that in its present form
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
even though i agree through that could
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much i have one
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
more person who wants to

and i'm appearing uh before you today on
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
behalf of the
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
professional insurance agents of new
 
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.309 align:start position:0%
professional insurance agents of new
hampshire

00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
and they are opposed to senate bill 36
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons and and frankly
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
for some of the reasons that you've
 
00:45:16.079 --> 00:45:16.550 align:start position:0%
for some of the reasons that you've
heard

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
currently an individual seeking coverage
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
for their automobile insurance must
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
sign this statement of residency prior
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
to obtaining the coverage there are a
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
couple of exceptions
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
one having been mentioned if the vehicle
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
is garaged here in new hampshire
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
and the other is for another is for
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
active military members
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
but it does make clear that anyone whose
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
primary residence
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
is outside of new hampshire cannot
 
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:51.829 align:start position:0%
is outside of new hampshire cannot
obtain

00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
obtain
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
automobile insurance as a state resident
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
except under those specific
 
00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.589 align:start position:0%
except under those specific
circumstances

00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's only required on the application
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
for the automobile insurance
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
this form it is not required for
 
00:46:07.359 --> 00:46:08.309 align:start position:0%
this form it is not required for
renewals

00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
renewals
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
as i understand it a renewal can
 
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
take place uninterrupted without the
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
need for the additional statement if no
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
changes to residency occur
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
it makes the law clear to consumers it
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
is a legal statement
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
and it guarantees that every person
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
seeking to buy
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
automobile insurance in new hampshire
 
00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:32.079 align:start position:0%
has been made aware of this law
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
and the consequences for violating it
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
we have some of the lowest rates
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
in the country your chairman has
 
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:41.990 align:start position:0%
in the country your chairman has
mentioned

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
that um especially as it compares to
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
doing away with this law this
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
requirement could potentially disrupt
 
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's stable and affordable
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
in short automobile insurance market the
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
rates in the state
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
altering the rating pool with
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
non-resident drivers could change the
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
rates for new hampshire consumers
 
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
carriers would still be able to deny
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
coverage for losses by anyone who
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
wrongfully claims
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire residency further
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
disrupting the marketplace
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
the potential increases to uninsured
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
motorist claims that would further risk
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
rate increases for new hampshire drivers
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
increasing the cost
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
of automobile insurance throughout new
 
00:47:35.119 --> 00:47:36.950 align:start position:0%
of automobile insurance throughout new
hampshire

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
now i never like to go against the
 
00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.030 align:start position:0%
now i never like to go against the
department

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
but i i would just like to point out
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
that in mr fox's statements
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
and frankly uh mr hayden's statements
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
and and jim's a personal friend of mine
 
00:47:51.839 --> 00:47:52.950 align:start position:0%
and and jim's a personal friend of mine
but

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
they've both said you know the law has
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
been on the books since 2004
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
and we haven't seen a problem that's a
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
good thing
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
they've basically told my story that
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
having this law in place it has enabled
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
you know new hampshire residents to
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
access insurance here and for
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
massachusetts residents
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
not to access insurance here if there's
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
a problem with the form
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
then let's change the form let's update
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
the form
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
both from an electronic perspective and
 
00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.349 align:start position:0%
both from an electronic perspective and
from

00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
a clarity perspective
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
i we we're not having the rate invasion
 
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:35.589 align:start position:0%
i we we're not having the rate invasion
that

00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
mr fox mentioned and
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
because you know we're we we have this
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
form in place
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
and so it's a protection for new
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire consumers
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
we would urge you to to maintain the
 
00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.630 align:start position:0%
we would urge you to to maintain the
form

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
maybe maintain some of the language in
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
in the the new language that's being
 
00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:56.870 align:start position:0%
in the the new language that's being
presented

00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
presented
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
for statutory purposes and to
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
direct the department to update the form
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
i'll close my testimony there and i'll
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
be happy to
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
try and address any questions any
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
we do have a question representative
 
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
abramson has a question
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
yeah um i've noticed that uh according
 
00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.069 align:start position:0%
yeah um i've noticed that uh according
to

00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
how much.net that uh the automotive
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
average automotive insurance premium is
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
about a hundred dollars a year lower in
 
00:49:28.839 --> 00:49:29.990 align:start position:0%
about a hundred dollars a year lower in
vermont

00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
if someone were shopping around say they
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
were the new england market why wouldn't
 
00:49:33.839 --> 00:49:35.510 align:start position:0%
were the new england market why wouldn't
they

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
just pick a vermont policy and save even
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
more money why would they
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
why would this even be a problem people
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
buying their insurance in new hampshire
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
if they know they can save even more
 
00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:47.589 align:start position:0%
if they know they can save even more
money

00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if i entirely understand
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
the question representative ravenson but
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're suggesting that they
 
00:49:54.319 --> 00:49:54.710 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're suggesting that they
would

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
try to buy insurance in vermont rather
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
than new hampshire
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
i guess i would defer to the department
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
of insurance in vermont
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
and their laws with respect to how that
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
well i mean i think the answer is that
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
they don't have a summer home in vermont
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
they have a summer home in
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and that's why they want
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
to register in new hampshire
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
well i'm just looking at the the list
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
they're actually quite a few states
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
around the country that have lower
 
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt and that the more rural
 
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
the state is the lower the
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh rates rates are that is true
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
so but i would say is that at the end of
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
the day you've got to have a place where
 
00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:34.150 align:start position:0%
the day you've got to have a place where
you

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
are you're somehow garaging it or
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
someplace you're putting the car or some
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
place the rationale
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
that you have an address so if you don't
 
00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
have any connection
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh i mean i remember when we were first
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
debating the issue was that there were
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
some people
 
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
were registering into a p.o box and that
 
00:50:49.839 --> 00:50:50.630 align:start position:0%
were registering into a p.o box and that
that

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
was an issue and that's why they wanted
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
you you got to give us a real address
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
you can't use a p.o box
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
berkey as i listened to you speak and
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
looked back
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
at the uh the bill as it stands now
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm struck by the fact that we are
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
talking about the form
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
and elimination of the form and yet the
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
wording here really doesn't
 
00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
address the form do you see what i'm
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
speaking about and would you respond to
 
00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:24.950 align:start position:0%
speaking about and would you respond to
that

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
concern please sure as
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
as i understand it with the way that the
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
bill is written when you where you see
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
in section two roman four
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
the language being stricken failure to
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
sign the new hampshire residency form
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
so there's that aspect to the bill
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
and then in the very last uh paragraph
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
section three roman two it repeals
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh 417 a3b
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
which is the um uh
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
the authorization for the form as i
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
understand it it's the statement of
 
00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.109 align:start position:0%
understand it it's the statement of
residency

00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
residency
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
and it has the form uh requirement built
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you you're all set okay um
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
bring up this issue to the senate we did
 
00:52:21.359 --> 00:52:21.910 align:start position:0%
bring up this issue to the senate we did
not

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
um we had a uh a meeting uh
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
just the last week of the week before
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
the insurance agents did
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
and that's when they took their official
 
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
position in opposition to senate bill
 
00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:33.750 align:start position:0%
position in opposition to senate bill
36.

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
36.
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
and you're not the independent agent
 
00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
you're the professional agent
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
my memory for professional uh insurance
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%

it turns out it's not so easy so um
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
having no more people signed up i guess
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%

00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
were to be approved
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
what adverse impact representative terry
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
um this is rick berkey i assume the
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
question was addressed to me
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly not an actuary so i i
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
cannot give you
 
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
specific numbers um but it
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
you know if if there was a a uh
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
a rising in claims an increase in claims
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
that could have an adverse impact on the
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
overall market within new hampshire
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
and therefore have a an impact on new
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire consumers and the rates they
 
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.150 align:start position:0%
hampshire consumers and the rates they
pay

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
pay
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
follow mr chairman another question
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
thank you so this is this is
 
00:54:07.359 --> 00:54:08.870 align:start position:0%
thank you so this is this is
hypothetical

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
hypothetical
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh because there's no actuary data
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
mr fox testified on behalf of the
 
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:15.510 align:start position:0%
mr fox testified on behalf of the
insurance

00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
department that new hampshire is the
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
only state that has this
 
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
requirement so are you familiar with any
 
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:23.349 align:start position:0%
requirement so are you familiar with any
adverse

00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
adverse
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
impacts in other any of the other 49
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%

mr chairman members of the commerce
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
committee um senator d'allesandro could
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%

00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt for joining with myself
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
and senator d
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
over the years to update our trust laws
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we have
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
tried to make this state
 
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
a very friendly state to be able to
 
00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:30.549 align:start position:0%
a very friendly state to be able to
locate

00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
locate
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
a trust or in competition with states
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
like delaware in particular
 
00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:38.799 align:start position:0%
but also south dakota and florida
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
for the kind of jobs that come with
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
um trust being incorporated in a state
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to stop there because
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
i think mr perlow probably can go
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
through the particulars of the bill
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
for you better than i can but i i think
 
00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:57.190 align:start position:0%
for you better than i can but i i think
the

00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
big picture is that we have had a number
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
of trust companies
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
located in new hampshire these are good
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
jobs and we should continue
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
to be at the cutting edge of what makes
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
a state attractive for trust so
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:21.750 align:start position:0%
okay uh so now i will call on patrick
collins

00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
collins
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
since we don't have a tag team we can't
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
have two and two at the desk at the same
 
00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:26.390 align:start position:0%
have two and two at the desk at the same
time

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%

thanks very much um but uh before i
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
begin let me echo
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh one thing senator bradley said and i
 
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
i think i mentioned this briefly when i
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to introduce myself
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
several months ago to the committee
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
but i would want to reiterate that um uh
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
we've presented
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
this committee with empirical data
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
regarding job growth and all that uh
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
in the past couple of years um but i can
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
definitely speak anecdotally
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh to our trust company jordan park
 
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
trust company
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
previously was prospective trust company
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
was established in 2007
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
and we recently were acquired by a much
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
larger registered investment advisor
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
out of san francisco with offices in new
 
00:59:28.319 --> 00:59:28.710 align:start position:0%
out of san francisco with offices in new
york

00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
york
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
and now new hampshire and not only is
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
our census
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
um scheduled to grow as we
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
simply take on new business uh but also
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
it's very clear that this company is uh
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
hiring in new hampshire
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
and citing people for uh our sister
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
investment advisor company uh and that's
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
precisely what we've been after
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh with that said the other thing i i
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
said the last time we spoke was
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
we're sensitive to two things uh what
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
you're challenged with in terms of the
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
covet pandemic and
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
getting through legislation uh but also
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
we're sensitive to criticism in the past
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
that we've been very energetic
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
in providing you with reams of of uh
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
paper uh so i'm happy to point out that
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
this is a two-page
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
bill it's very targeted uh and it
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
is uh designed to help uh settlers of
 
01:00:22.799 --> 01:00:23.750 align:start position:0%
is uh designed to help uh settlers of
trusts

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
trusts
 
01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:26.799 align:start position:0%
uh uh beneficiaries of trust and also
 
01:00:26.799 --> 01:00:27.270 align:start position:0%
uh uh beneficiaries of trust and also
enable

01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
enable
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
trustees to do a better job for them uh
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
so quickly
 
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
the first section of the bill and i did
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
provide the written testimony
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
which goes into a little bit more detail
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
but the first section
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
deals with representation which is um
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
when you have beneficiaries
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
who uh may be underage maybe uh special
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
needs or in some other way
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
need someone to represent their
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
interests with regard to a trust
 
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
this simply expands a list of seven
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
different folks with different
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
characteristics to also include
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
the person who settled the trust in
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
terms of giving them the opportunity to
 
01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.510 align:start position:0%
terms of giving them the opportunity to
name

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
name
 
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
a trusted friend an organization um you
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
know someone to
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh to uh assert representation
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
and we just think this is a miss that uh
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
should have been there
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
all along uh secondly um
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
and this one is really an administrative
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
efficiency issue
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
very often uh older trusts that have
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
provisions that are more difficult
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
to uh to follow or have some other
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
change that ought to be made
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
are decanted or poured into a second
 
01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.829 align:start position:0%
are decanted or poured into a second
trust

01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
trust
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
and it's not been clear under new
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire law whether or not you need to
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
create a new
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
trust and when you create a new trust
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
obviously that's extra
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
expense um in terms of drafting that
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
but also then you're required to go out
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
and get a new uh
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
federal tax number for the trust so what
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
this will allow is
 
01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh several variations of that theme that
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
adds some efficiency by allowing you to
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
use an existing trust
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily changing the tax
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
number it's consistent with federal law
 
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
and it gives some flexibility to save
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
some money and time
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh and finally the last section uh very
 
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:10.470 align:start position:0%
uh and finally the last section uh very
often

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
often
 
01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
um particularly in a trust where the
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
grantor is no longer involved with said
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
law or they've passed away
 
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
um you've got beneficiaries and the the
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
the trust never said exactly how things
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
should be invested
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
but you may have a group of
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries who are like-minded
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
and it may be that there's a specific
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
company they want to invest in or they
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
may want to invest in
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh not invest in a category of companies
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
um and what this is a lot allows is a
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement amongst the
 
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.349 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement amongst the
beneficiaries

01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
um only in certain circumstances but it
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
allows them to give a directive to the
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
trustee and it says
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
if you invest as directed by this group
 
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
of beneficiaries
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
and that is not optimal in terms of
 
01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:52.390 align:start position:0%
and that is not optimal in terms of
return

01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
return
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh you're not on the hook as a fiduciary
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
because you were directed under the law
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
so uh in a nutshell that's the bill if
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
anyone would like to deep dive on any of
 
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
that patrick will be
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
better equipped to do that and i thank
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
okay uh seeing no direct questions we'll
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
go right
 
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
right to uh mr collins
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
i think i think glenn generally thank
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
you for for having me i think glenn
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
generally wants me here just in case
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
there are any
 
01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
technical questions uh i don't have
 
01:03:23.839 --> 01:03:24.390 align:start position:0%
technical questions uh i don't have
anything

01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
further to add to his uh his general
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
overview of the bill
 
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
okay okay so uh any members of the
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh seen none we thank you oh
 
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
you have reverence and mclare uh yes
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh mr chairman
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
uh two questions if i might um
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
would a family llc
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
fit into the definition of a trust under
 
01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:55.510 align:start position:0%
fit into the definition of a trust under
this

01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
law and actually under existing new
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire laws
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh i i'm gonna uh i'm gonna suggest that
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
you're asking about
 
01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
a family trust company in an llc form
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
correct uh
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
directly none of this legislation uh
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
addresses that as a company that
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
that uh it's in and of itself is not a
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
trust and this legislation is all
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
addressing uh new hampshire trust code
 
01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.549 align:start position:0%
addressing uh new hampshire trust code
permissions

01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
permissions
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
second question um how long
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
can a family trust or go on
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is it perpetual or
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
is there a final generational
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
stop there is no final generational stop
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
under the um under the either uh
 
01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:47.829 align:start position:0%
under the um under the either uh
chartered

01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
chartered
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
or uh self-regulated family trust
 
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.029 align:start position:0%
or uh self-regulated family trust
companies

01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
um are perpetual like like any other
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
company just to add to that question
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
would that include an llc then or not
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
yeah if by yes a family trust company in
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
the form of an llc
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
um has no particular uh time
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
limit and trust which a family trust
 
01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
company exists to
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
administer for the family those trusts
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh can exist in perpetuity under new
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire law that's a
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
major feature of new hampshire thank you
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
yeah i was the sponsor of the repeal of
 
01:05:27.599 --> 01:05:28.150 align:start position:0%
yeah i was the sponsor of the repeal of
rural

01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
rural
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
of perpetuity and that was a long time
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
ago so we appreciate it that was my one
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
of my first trust spills that i put in
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
and so representative herbert you have a
 
01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:43.109 align:start position:0%
and so representative herbert you have a
question

01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
thank you can you hear me yes we can
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay just this is i don't want to
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
go sideways here but uh what
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
the fiduciary uh responsibility
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
it sounded to me as though uh the uh the
 
01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.430 align:start position:0%
it sounded to me as though uh the uh the
benefit

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries could instruct the
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
fiduciary to
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
make an investment that may not be
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
all that wise and so and
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
and and i if i heard correctly the
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
fiduciary uh
 
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
has the ability to uh not be
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
involved or or not be
 
01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
a fiduciary you know what i'm saying
 
01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.150 align:start position:0%
a fiduciary you know what i'm saying
because

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
i a fiduciary to me has a certain
 
01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
meaning in terms of their
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh towards the
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
family or the beneficiaries uh in
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
brings up the issue of being a fiduciary
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
in conflict uh with the beneficiary's
 
01:06:50.559 --> 01:06:51.510 align:start position:0%
in conflict uh with the beneficiary's
desires

01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
desires
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
to make an investment of some sort i
 
01:06:54.319 --> 01:06:54.950 align:start position:0%
to make an investment of some sort i
mean

01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
is that are you still are you still a
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
fiduciary if that happens
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
patrick i see you unmuted i i'd be happy
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
to start the answer to this question i
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
think patrick may be able to help out as
 
01:07:06.559 --> 01:07:07.109 align:start position:0%
think patrick may be able to help out as
well

01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
so so uh a fiduciary uh
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
yes is the short answer to are you still
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
a fiduciary
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
um and you know a trustee
 
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire in many places uh can
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
take many forms
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
and in some cases you are a directed
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
trustee with a more limited set of
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duties
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
and in this case essentially um
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
this is directing that fiduciary and
 
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's really
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
an exception to the prudent investor
 
01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:36.789 align:start position:0%
an exception to the prudent investor
rule

01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:36.799 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
so if you look at how this uh how the
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
actual language of legislation
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
uh fits in under the prudent investor
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
rule there are a
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
series of exceptions um uh
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
cases or not exceptions i shouldn't say
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
but factors
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
that the fiduciary uh canon and
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
should take into account um when
 
01:07:59.829 --> 01:07:59.839 align:start position:0%
deciding on investing
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
for example and in in in this case
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
what it's saying is if there is uh and
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know you can concentrate
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
for example the situation maybe that the
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
trust owns a business
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
and it is completely rational that the
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
purpose of the trust is to own that
 
01:08:15.359 --> 01:08:16.149 align:start position:0%
purpose of the trust is to own that
business

01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
that is a concentration of the assets of
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
the trust
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
in one investment which would ordinarily
 
01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:23.510 align:start position:0%
in one investment which would ordinarily
be

01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know against the general
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty commissioners generally
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
spread out investments they they're
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
avoiding loss
 
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
but it's circumstantially allowed um
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
because in many circumstances that's the
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing to do
 
01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
so what this is saying is uh first of
 
01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:40.870 align:start position:0%
so what this is saying is uh first of
all

01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
there's no certainty that this type of
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
investing there's no
 
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:46.799 align:start position:0%
evidence that it's uh better or worse
 
01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
from a return standpoint
 
01:08:50.789 --> 01:08:50.799 align:start position:0%
but it's saying that this is a factor
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
that you can take into account so if
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
you're directed to do this you can do
 
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:54.550 align:start position:0%
you're directed to do this you can do
this

01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
and it's not a violation of your
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
fiduciary it certainly doesn't relieve
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
you of being a fiduciary
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i would only add that's well said i
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
would only add that if
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
the in a trust context the fiduciary
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
which is the trustee owes a fiduciary to
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
two duty to two people
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
two groups of people one is the settler
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
of the trust and that is to carry out
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
the terms
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the trust if there's specific
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
investment instructions they have to
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
follow those instructions the second
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
group is to the beneficiaries and what
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
this law is doing is saying if the
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries unite
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
and say hey we want to we want to invest
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
in esg
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
related investments we don't want uh to
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
have investments for
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels or so on and so forth if
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
they combine in an agreement with them
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
and the trustees the uh
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh the fiduciary duty in that context is
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
is uh effectively
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
modifying the traditional um
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh duties under the prune investor rule
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
to allow for this investment
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
only if they're all in it together all
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
the beneficiaries agree
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
that this is a uh you know an investment
 
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
that they want and so it's it's
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
changing the fiduciary duty in that
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
context but only
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
from the parties who would be affected
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
by that decision
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
and also only if it in no way is
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
adverse to any material in terms of the
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
trust so if the
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
sedler contrary to the wishes of the
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
beneficiary had set out that
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know there shall be a
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
concentration or you shall never let go
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
of that exxon stock
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
that made this fortune um then you
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't do this
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh because that would be a material term
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
of the trust and this would be contrary
 
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
so it's really only where the situation
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
is everybody
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh who should have a say has uh got on
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
the same page and said this is how we
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
would like to do it and we're willing to
 
01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
take the risk so
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
what happens if the beneficiaries want
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
to spend down
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
and say okay we just want to dissolve
 
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
this thing can they
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a sort of whole other
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
question unrelated to this legislation
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
but patrick i would defer to you
 
01:11:17.669 --> 01:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
yeah typically the this this bill here
 
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
is not allowing the beneficiaries to
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
unite in that way and say we'd rather
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
have this money in our hands than in the
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
trust you can't
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
do that by virtue of this bill uh
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
certainly they could
 
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
try to do that under other provisions of
 
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
the trust code but
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
the trust code is pretty limiting in
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
allowing a beneficiary to
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
basically unwind the trust and terminate
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
early earlier than was contemplated by
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
just the nature of the investment not
 
01:11:45.679 --> 01:11:46.310 align:start position:0%
just the nature of the investment not
necessarily

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
exactly spend it yeah right mr chairman
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
it happens that the the statutory
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
provision in which this
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
makes sense to insert it um is in regard
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
it is using a mechanism uh of a
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
non-judicial settlement agreement and
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
there are a variety of circumstances
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
where things can be changed
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
but always within the four corners of
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
the trust
 
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
fair enough uh representative fargo oh
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair are we gonna hear
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
any testimony from the banking
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner or the banking department
 
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh evidently they have not signed up for
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
but if i may uh representative fargo um
 
01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:25.990 align:start position:0%
but if i may uh representative fargo um
we

01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
follow a pretty strict process as they
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
do and we
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
sort of all do together of stakeholder
 
01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:32.950 align:start position:0%
sort of all do together of stakeholder
uh

01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
information and involvement and so this
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
was provided
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
to the banking department and discussed
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
now i want to say three or four months
 
01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:40.870 align:start position:0%
now i want to say three or four months
ago

01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
um and also provided to well over 50
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
trust and estates uh attorneys who
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
gathered together to look at legislation
 
01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
um also i've worked with the charitable
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
trust director
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
on some of the specific language which
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
you can spot in the
 
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
statute or in the legislation um
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
and the bankers association was also
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
part of our stakeholder discussion
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you hey representative abel
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank you both for for testifying
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
and explaining things uh of all the
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
areas that perhaps this committee covers
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
for many of us including me
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
trusts are one of the harder ones to
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
completely understand my question
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
is what was the impetus
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
for for uh for this bill
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
for introducing this bill um
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
and what what are the problems what are
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
things that
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh are prevented from being done now
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
that this bill would
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
would solve i guess what problems are we
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
i'll speak to the impetus and i'll let
 
01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
patrick speak as a practitioner to the
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
to the problems but
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
um we we uh as an organization the the
 
01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
trust council
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
um we uh collect and we think on
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
both our existing trust code and what's
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
going on here and then of course
 
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
we watch other states sometimes that's
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
kind of an arms race thing
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
but most often it's not most often it's
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
just it's an active profession
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh with a lot of dialogue and um you
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
know constantly looking for ways to
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
lubricate the system so it's easier for
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
settlers and
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
clients um and also just to
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
to fix up anything that somebody may see
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
an issue with
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
these three provisions came from sort of
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
three different quarters
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you with regard to the
 
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
esg the third
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
major uh provision um this is something
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
that several members of
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
the trust council are finding just more
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
and more their clients are asking
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
hey can we you know do something about
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
how things are invested
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
um and so this was this was floated and
 
01:15:04.239 --> 01:15:04.790 align:start position:0%
um and so this was this was floated and
vetted

01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
vetted
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
and um and seemed to be an opportunity
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
for clarity
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh so that trustees can meet their
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
clients needs
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh patrick i'll let you go maybe through
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
each quickly
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
as to what it does for a client
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
particularly obviously for the client
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
the settler
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
and or beneficiaries yeah sure it's
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
great great question
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative i i think the first
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
one dealing with uh with representation
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
is is trying to uh avoid the spoiled
 
01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:35.110 align:start position:0%
is is trying to uh avoid the spoiled
child

01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh and we have a provision in the trust
 
01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:38.630 align:start position:0%
uh and we have a provision in the trust
code

01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
code
 
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
currently that allows for what are
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
called quiet trusts
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh that allow a trustee to not disclose
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
the terms or the assets in a trust
 
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh to uh to really beneficiaries
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
until you know usually they reach a
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
certain age or some life event
 
01:15:58.630 --> 01:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
what is what is missing is that while
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
that beneficiary
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't know what's going on
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
intentionally to try to avoid you know
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
the spoiled child syndrome
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have a provision that allows
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
someone to be representing them
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh while they're in the dark if if you
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
will so this allows
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh someone to represent the
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
beneficiary's interest
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
while they're not aware of the trust's
 
01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.990 align:start position:0%
while they're not aware of the trust's
existence

01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
existence
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
so we think this is a good beneficiary
 
01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:23.830 align:start position:0%
so we think this is a good beneficiary
rights

01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
provision the second one for decanting
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
which is a procedure whereby
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
you take the assets of one trust and
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
decant them into a second trust usually
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
to modernize or update the trust
 
01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.470 align:start position:0%
to modernize or update the trust
provisions

01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
there's a uh there's a
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
procedural um nuance that's not
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
clear in the statute as to whether or
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
not you need to actually
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
create a second trust meaning
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
a trust with a different name which
 
01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
would require that you re-title all the
 
01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:58.950 align:start position:0%
would require that you re-title all the
assets

01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
assets
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
which can be a cumbersome time consuming
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
expensive process
 
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
so this is saying look if you do a
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
decanting you can keep the same name of
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
the trust you don't have to retitle
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
everything and go through all that
 
01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
rigmarole and you can also keep the same
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
tax id number so you don't have to
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
um you know file a whole separate tax
 
01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:19.430 align:start position:0%
um you know file a whole separate tax
return

01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
return
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth uh so just it just
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
makes that process more efficient
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
and then the third one i think glenn
 
01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
spoke to which is
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
just trying to find a way to uh
 
01:17:33.669 --> 01:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
one on the one hand from a marketing
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
standpoint make new hampshire
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know again an attractive state i
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
don't know of any other state that has
 
01:17:39.679 --> 01:17:41.110 align:start position:0%
don't know of any other state that has
specifically

01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
put into their trust code a provision
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
or a statute that allows for
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
esg investing through a non-judicial
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
so it will it will highlight new
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire as a unique state in that
 
01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.430 align:start position:0%
hampshire as a unique state in that
context

01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
context
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
and secondly to serve the
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know the clients of of of
 
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire trust companies uh that
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
that are specifically looking for this
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh as a way to uh provide more
 
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.110 align:start position:0%
uh as a way to uh provide more
flexibility

01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
and and selfishly on behalf of the trust
 
01:18:13.679 --> 01:18:14.709 align:start position:0%
and and selfishly on behalf of the trust
company

01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
company
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh to to uh limit the liability that a
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
trustee may otherwise
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
be confronted with uh in making an esg
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
investment that might
 
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
run counter to the prune investor rule
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
without such an agreement in place
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
patrick you want to explain what esg
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
means because i'm sure
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
not everybody knows yeah so it's it's um
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
a type of investment that is
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
um uh focused on environmental social
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
and governance objectives so it's
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
it's really to give a practical example
 
01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:48.870 align:start position:0%
it's really to give a practical example
it's

01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
those people that want to have an
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
investment that is not
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
furthering uh some environmental
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh aspect of uh
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know in the world so so for example
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
they may say we don't want to be
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
invested in fossil fuels
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
so we want to make a directive that the
 
01:19:08.229 --> 01:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
trust not
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
further fossil fuel investments and
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
instead invest
 
01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
in environmentally friendly companies
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
if i might add though it's broader than
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
that and i think it's
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's easy because it's got this label
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
environmental social governance
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
more and more the dialogue is about
 
01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.070 align:start position:0%
more and more the dialogue is about
governance

01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
governance
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
and uh liability risk that
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
certain certain large corporations bring
 
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
um and so for sophisticated investors
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
there's more of a focus
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
these days to get really into the nuts
 
01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
and bolts of a company
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
is that company run in a manner that i
 
01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:43.750 align:start position:0%
is that company run in a manner that i
like

01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
so it it is not left or right
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
or or progressive or it's it's uh
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
it could be anything it's the
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
concentration the directive
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
to do an investment that's very specific
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know a broad-based kind of mutual
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
fund type of
 
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
of investing that's often the case when
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
you're just preserving the trust asset
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
okay perfect thank you any other
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members
 
01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:18.239 align:start position:0%

01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
and out for employers if there's um
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
on line 9 and 10 in the
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
in the bill it says unless each employer
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
can demonstrate that the accommodation
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
would impose an
 
01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
undue hardship on the operation of an
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
employer's business
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%

01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
um the accommodations and these
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
accommodations can be very simple things
 
01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:39.669 align:start position:0%
accommodations can be very simple things
like

01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
allowing more uh bathroom breaks during
 
01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
a work
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
period it can allow and
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
more shorter breaks it can allow extra
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
water breaks it can allow having a
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
bottle of water at their workstation
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
and a lot of these things can be worked
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
out between the employer and the
 
01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:00.470 align:start position:0%
out between the employer and the
employee

01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%

01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
um rehydration during work
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh are very important and yet the bill
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
itself as stated here
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
talks about a period of temporary
 
01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
physical disability
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
would you respond to the need for that
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
wording please
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh the period of temporary disability
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
that refers to
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
or permit a female employee to take
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
leave of absence
 
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
so that refers to a leave of absence and
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
not to reasonable accommodations on the
 
01:24:34.629 --> 01:24:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you okay uh
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
representative burrows
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question um
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
i appreciate and um support the um
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill um i'm just wondering
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
it just the wording is just so
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the word to use
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
nebulous it's it
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
as i'm i'm just wondering how this is
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
going to be enforced i mean how long
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
um could a temporary uh is a temporary
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
leave of absence
 
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
and what specific reasonable uh
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
accommodations would an employer need to
 
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
make it's just so
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
um wide open that i just wonder if it
 
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
has any teeth to it so i was wondering
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
if you could respond to that
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
i think i well there may be other people
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
on the line that could
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
respond to the how long but there's
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
temporary disability laws in the state
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't know all of those
 
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
um but as far as uh what a reasonable
 
01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.270 align:start position:0%
um but as far as uh what a reasonable
accommodation

01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
is that the the wording has been vetted
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
by different business groups by
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
the ag's office by the humans right
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
commission and this is
 
01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
this is the wording that everyone agreed
 
01:25:50.629 --> 01:25:50.639 align:start position:0%
on and
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
in in the maybe the vagueness of it is
 
01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
that everyone's
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
um reasonable accommodation is going to
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
be different
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
if i am a person at a um
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
at a that's a cashier and doing checkout
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
all day long
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
my reasonable accommodation may be a
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
high-top stool that i can sit on
 
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
or a water bottle at my checkout station
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
if i am a person who is doing heavy
 
01:26:14.719 --> 01:26:15.750 align:start position:0%
if i am a person who is doing heavy
lifting

01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
lifting
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
and um in a warehouse facility my
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation may be a
 
01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:22.550 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation may be a
temporary

01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
change of workspace to do data entry
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
instead of heavy lifting
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
so it's it's different for everyone and
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
that's why it can't be
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
specifics can't be addressed in the bill
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
for the question main query so just a
 
01:26:36.719 --> 01:26:37.830 align:start position:0%
for the question main query so just a
hypothetical

01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
hypothetical
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
if um if a woman uh feels a reasonable
 
01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:42.709 align:start position:0%
if um if a woman uh feels a reasonable
accommodation

01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
um need uh that needs frequent uh
 
01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
bathroom breaks i mean like two an hour
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
let's just say that and the
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
employer doesn't feel that's reasonable
 
01:26:53.189 --> 01:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
how does that get resolved
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
um the resolution would go through the
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
commission on for human rights i believe
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
and that can be confirmed by um director
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
malachi when she speaks later
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
for introducing this bill
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking at the undue hardship and
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
it looks like the burden is put on the
 
01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:18.639 align:start position:0%
employer um
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
how much is the undue partnership is is
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
it an amount of money
 
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
10 000 per employee or is it i mean
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
how's it calculated
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
how how can it be made predictable i
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that question
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
i think it would be different in in
 
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
everyone's case and it would be
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
it would follow through the commission
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
process so they might be able to answer
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
that question but i think it would be
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
different for every employer
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up further question you may
 
01:27:50.639 --> 01:27:51.220 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up further question you may
inquire

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:51.230 align:start position:0%
inquire
 
01:27:51.230 --> 01:27:53.830 align:start position:0%
inquire
[Music]

01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
not to completely change gears but if
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
the burden does become two pion
 
01:27:58.239 --> 01:27:59.669 align:start position:0%
the burden does become two pion
employers

01:27:59.669 --> 01:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
with this bill as written would make it
 
01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
tougher for women of child-bearing age
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
to find work especially in management or
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
specialist position medical specialist
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
some other
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh uh representative greeson
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
senator uh for your testimony this
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
morning uh
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
my question is how how much of a problem
 
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
is it for uh pregnant employees
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to discuss with their
 
01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.110 align:start position:0%
to be able to discuss with their
employer

01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
some sort of extra break or something
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
like that i to me
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
it seems foreign to mistreat my
 
01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:45.990 align:start position:0%
it seems foreign to mistreat my
employees

01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
i've had pregnant employees in the past
 
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
and it just was foreign to me to
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
deny them restroom breaks or water at
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
their station
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
so how much of a widespread problem is
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
this that we need to codify this into
 
01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:00.470 align:start position:0%
this that we need to codify this into
law

01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
i i don't believe the the problem is
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
widespread in new hampshire
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
and i i agree i think we have some great
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
employers out there
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
this is to put into law that new
 
01:29:10.159 --> 01:29:11.350 align:start position:0%
this is to put into law that new
hampshire

01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
appreciates uh pregnant women
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
and will help to accommodate their their
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
needs in the workplace
 
01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
and if for um if there is an instance
 
01:29:22.239 --> 01:29:22.790 align:start position:0%
and if for um if there is an instance
where

01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
a woman cannot come to agreement with
 
01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
her employer that this is what the
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
reason is for and someone else on the
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
line might be able to go
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you very much senator

think
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%

designed to prevent discrimination
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
in the state in addition to the powers
 
01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:03.189 align:start position:0%
in the state in addition to the powers
vested

01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
vested
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
in the commission by rsa 354-a to
 
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
enforce new hampshire's laws against
 
01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.110 align:start position:0%
enforce new hampshire's laws against
discrimination

01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
the commission also partners with the
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
eeoc which is the u.s
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%

01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
commission to enforce federal laws
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
prohibiting discrimination in employment
 
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
and we have a very small staff so
 
01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
we cover the entire state of new
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire with our
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
with our small staff so we have five
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
investigators myself
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
is the executive director we have an
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
assistant director and
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh recently hired a paralegal um and we
 
01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.070 align:start position:0%
uh recently hired a paralegal um and we
also

01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
have uh limited admin staff
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
um so one of the things i wanted to go
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
over relative to
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
sb 68 is in cooperation
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
with um last session with
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
senator jeb bradley um we we constructed
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
this bill now sb 68
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
what it will do is codify what the
 
01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:03.110 align:start position:0%
what it will do is codify what the
commission

01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
has done since 1965 when we were
 
01:33:06.159 --> 01:33:07.750 align:start position:0%
has done since 1965 when we were
established

01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
established
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is something that we
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
take charges on uh it's not rampant uh
 
01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
but we do take charges of discrimination
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
in this area
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
currently so what sp 68 does is it puts
 
01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.790 align:start position:0%
currently so what sp 68 does is it puts
it

01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
it answers the question and speaks
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
specifically to
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
what we do relative to pregnancy
 
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
puts it all in one place makes it easy
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure were there any other
 
01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
were there any additional any questions
 
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
oh and of course we do support
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
sb68 as we did work with senator bradley
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
to construct it
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
and then i've worked closely with
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey this session
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
to move this forward as well as the new
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire breastfeeding task force
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
um they have been established as a
 
01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:01.110 align:start position:0%
um they have been established as a
non-profit

01:34:01.110 --> 01:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
non-profit
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
since well they're a grassroots
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
organization i think pretty recently are
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh considered a non-profit now uh but
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
they've been around since 1997 and
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
they've worked on legislation they've
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
worked with
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
businesses they've worked with hospitals
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
and moms et cetera
 
01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
um to to further the the charge
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
of uh breastfeeding lactation and
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
assistance for mothers
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the state so i'll rest it there and
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you might have
 
01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative van houghton
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you very much and
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh there has been some previous concern
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
in just the last few minutes about some
 
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
of the language in the bill
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
and i do recognize that some of the
 
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
language is not nebulous what is
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable for instance
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
and my reference to disability when
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about pregnancy
 
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
and i i think i recognize that that
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
almost has to be
 
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
does this legislation should it pass
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
give you any kind of regulatory
 
01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:58.870 align:start position:0%
give you any kind of regulatory
authority

01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
so that you will be able to interpret
 
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
how this wording
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
impacts those employers and employees
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much representative
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
van hoten for the question
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
um we have statutory authority uh as it
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
stands right now so we
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
are the enforcement agency for any
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
charge of discrimination
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire so i and i apologize i
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
neglected to share this
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
if there's a charge of discrimination in
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
any of those areas that i mentioned that
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
we have jurisdiction so
 
01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
employment housing public accommodation
 
01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
and k-12 education
 
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
you come to us first so um
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
k-12 is a little different uh just i'm
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
trying not to be too confusing or too
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
wordy here
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
you do have an opportunity to go to
 
01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
court instead
 
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
but in employment um and housing
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
education customarily you come to us
 
01:35:50.239 --> 01:35:50.950 align:start position:0%
education customarily you come to us
first

01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
so you don't go to court you file your
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
charge with us
 
01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
and then we move forward from there so
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
with that being said
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
what the language is in sp 68
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
is the language that we use currently
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
to take any charges in this in this area
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
so what we've done is pull the language
 
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
from a couple of different spots
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
put it all into one so that it will be
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
in one area if if that makes sense and
 
01:36:17.199 --> 01:36:17.590 align:start position:0%
in one area if if that makes sense and
to

01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
your point it does have to be a little
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
vague because
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
as senator hennessey so eloquently
 
01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:25.109 align:start position:0%
as senator hennessey so eloquently
stated

01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
stated
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
one person's accommodation is not the
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
other person's accommodation
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
and um and what happens is the law of
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
law of unintended consequences
 
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
the more specific you are the more
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
people you potentially leave out so
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
you certainly don't want it to be too
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
vague but you also want
 
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
enough of an explanation so that
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
when someone is is looking something up
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
they have
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
a guidance they have parameters and
 
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
if i were pregnant and i i'm at my job
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
working with the hr person
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
and it's now time for me to go on leave
 
01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
because it's right before my due date
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
and then i'll be out on leave these are
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
some of the same terms that you would
 
01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:09.669 align:start position:0%
some of the same terms that you would
use

01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
in a business in an hr setting so it's
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's synonymous
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
so it helps everyone to say the same
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
thing and mean the same thing
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your question it
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
does me a follow-up please
 
01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
hear the question inquire thank you uh
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
what kinds of
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
consequences would be available for you
 
01:37:28.629 --> 01:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
to meet out would it be corrective
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
action for the employer or
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
or what kinds of consequences or
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
directions are available to you
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
should you find culpability um yes thank
 
01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
um so a person uh will will come to us
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
and say
 
01:37:45.189 --> 01:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
i've been wronged and they will share
 
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
what that is
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
if it meets um the if it's within our
 
01:37:49.119 --> 01:37:50.149 align:start position:0%
if it meets um the if it's within our
jurisdiction

01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
so jurisdiction is is a handful of
 
01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:53.510 align:start position:0%
so jurisdiction is is a handful of
things

01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
um as long as there it is within the
 
01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
time frame
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
uh so there's a 180-day statute of
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
limitations from the last
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
action that that happened to the
 
01:38:05.199 --> 01:38:06.709 align:start position:0%
action that that happened to the
individual

01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
and if it's something that we cover so
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
if it's an
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
someone who's incarcerated for example
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
that would not be within our
 
01:38:13.199 --> 01:38:14.470 align:start position:0%
that would not be within our
jurisdiction

01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
okay so for this example the um
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
the woman is saying i'm not being given
 
01:38:21.109 --> 01:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
bathroom breaks
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
um and then they reach out to us
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
the first thing we do is have you
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
reached out to
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
your if it's a floor manager have you
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
talked to the manager above that person
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
have you reached out to hr
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
no i haven't okay thank you for letting
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
us know reach back out to the company
 
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:38.629 align:start position:0%
us know reach back out to the company
but

01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
contact us and let us know if you're if
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
you don't get satisfaction
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
i reached out to my company they're not
 
01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
they're refusing to do this
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
it's in writing somewhere that i can't
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
have these bathroom breaks okay
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
then we'll take your charge we take the
 
01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
individual's charge
 
01:38:57.669 --> 01:38:57.679 align:start position:0%
and then we um we dock at that
 
01:38:57.679 --> 01:38:58.550 align:start position:0%
and then we um we dock at that
information

01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
and then we send written information of
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
this charge of discrimination
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
to the business and they have an
 
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to give a response to that
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
so let's say that we have found that
 
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
there has been discrimination that
 
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
the um that the woman went through the
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
proper chain of command
 
01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
because that's important to request the
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
bathroom breaks that she
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
the additional bathroom breaks that she
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
was needing
 
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
she was denied that and so let's say
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
we've moved forward
 
01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
and we have now found probable cause for
 
01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:30.070 align:start position:0%
and we have now found probable cause for
this

01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
um for the individual who's filed this
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
charge of discrimination
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
so along the way there's mediation
 
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's possible
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
if um if the person if the business and
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
are willing to mediate um the woman may
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
say listen i i filed this so that i
 
01:39:46.239 --> 01:39:46.790 align:start position:0%
say listen i i filed this so that i
could

01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
get them to honor the what i need
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
but i don't really want to go through
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
all of this i just need bathroom breaks
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
and so if we're able to mediate
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
something and work it out
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
with the company then we're happy to do
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
that our mediation program is free
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
and we offer that for every
 
01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
charge that makes sense to offer
 
01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.109 align:start position:0%
charge that makes sense to offer
mediation

01:40:09.109 --> 01:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
mediation
 
01:40:11.189 --> 01:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
so with that being said there could be
 
01:40:11.199 --> 01:40:12.310 align:start position:0%
so with that being said there could be
fines

01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
fines
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
the individual may have um financial
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
compensation that they're looking for if
 
01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
they've lost wages if they've
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
lost time from work if they got fired or
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
something along those lines and so
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
those things are included in the
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
outcomes that they're looking for with
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
their charge
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
and of course when the investigator
 
01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:33.109 align:start position:0%
and of course when the investigator
investigates

01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
investigates
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
one of those things that they may
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
suggest is
 
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
that there be a policy on pregnancy um
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
and um and and related
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
conditions so i hope that answered your
 
01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:47.270 align:start position:0%
conditions so i hope that answered your
question

01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
it does thank you and one more quick
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
in your opinion then this legislation
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
would help to facilitate the fair and
 
01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable process that you've just
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
documented for us
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for the follow-up
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
representative and yes
 
01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
i in my in my opinion it would do that
 
01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:07.030 align:start position:0%
i in my in my opinion it would do that
yes

01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative abramson
 
01:41:11.109 --> 01:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
i i guess on this if i'm if i'm a small
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
employer if i'm a small business
 
01:41:25.350 --> 01:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
and i don't have the regulatory
 
01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
consultants and the lawyer on retainer
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
and whatnot
 
01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
how do i figure out what how much is an
 
01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
undue hardship is it capped at ten
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per employee
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
or or what is it um thank you
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh abramson for the
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
question so
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
undue hardship um it's it could be a
 
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
variety of things
 
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
so for example and let's use the example
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
that senator hennessey gave
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
if i worked in a warehouse i'm a
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
pregnant woman i work in a warehouse
 
01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
and um what i'm requesting i you know my
 
01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
doctor is saying
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
i can only lift uh 10 pounds whereas i
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
usually could lift
 
01:42:07.590 --> 01:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
25 pounds so i go to the employer and i
 
01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:08.790 align:start position:0%
25 pounds so i go to the employer and i
say

01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
i have a weight lifting restriction
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
and it's it's only 10 pounds um
 
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
and then the employer says oh okay well
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
we can put you we can change your shift
 
01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:20.310 align:start position:0%
we can put you we can change your shift
or

01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
we can move you to a different area in
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
the warehouse to accommodate
 
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
the 10-pound lift or we can slightly
 
01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:27.510 align:start position:0%
the 10-pound lift or we can slightly
change

01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:30.639 align:start position:0%
what you do during your regular shift
 
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
to accommodate you i may i might say
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that but i'm not
 
01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
interested in doing that i'd much rather
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
work in this area over here where
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's no lifting at all or i'd
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
rather go to a different plant or
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
i would rather not work during this time
 
01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
during the entire pregnancy so um or
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
i can come in but i won't lift anything
 
01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
but if you could have this other
 
01:43:01.119 --> 01:43:02.070 align:start position:0%
but if you could have this other
employee

01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
do all of the lifting then i would much
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
rather prefer that
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
so here's the impasse
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
what the employee is is specifically
 
01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:14.070 align:start position:0%
what the employee is is specifically
needing

01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
needing
 
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
is the weight restriction for the 10
 
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
pounds at per the doctor
 
01:43:21.669 --> 01:43:21.679 align:start position:0%
what the employer has offered is several
 
01:43:21.679 --> 01:43:22.390 align:start position:0%
what the employer has offered is several
ways

01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
ways
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
to accommodate that employee
 
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
that fall within what's what's available
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
for the employer
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
what they can afford to do and it
 
01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't change anything
 
01:43:35.590 --> 01:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
they're doing their portion to
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
accommodate the employee
 
01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
the employee has decided that they don't
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
like the accommodation
 
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
and so they want someone else to fulfill
 
01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:45.590 align:start position:0%
and so they want someone else to fulfill
their

01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
complete job description and
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
they either don't do their job
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
description at all or
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
go to a plant or somewhere completely
 
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
different that is not
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
that doesn't work for the employer so
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
all of this
 
01:44:01.510 --> 01:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
is an interactive process they work
 
01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:02.870 align:start position:0%
is an interactive process they work
together

01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
and so it could be an undue hardship
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
for the employer to hire someone
 
01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
different to
 
01:44:12.390 --> 01:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
offer overtime for someone else to do
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
the work
 
01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
that this particular employee could have
 
01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
done with the accommodation
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
so every workspace each employer is a
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
little different
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
and there are different things that
 
01:44:26.229 --> 01:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
could be considered undo hardships
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
and how this really works is if the
 
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
employer has a question
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
although the commission is the
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency we're neutral
 
01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
we are not attorneys that represent a
 
01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:38.550 align:start position:0%
we are not attorneys that represent a
complainant

01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
complainant
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
we also do not represent the respondent
 
01:44:42.149 --> 01:44:42.159 align:start position:0%
if the
 
01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
responding business has a question they
 
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
can call us
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
when they receive this information that
 
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
they've been charged with you know
 
01:44:51.990 --> 01:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination they can call us and go i
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
don't really understand what's happening
 
01:44:53.679 --> 01:44:54.229 align:start position:0%
don't really understand what's happening
here

01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
can you explain this and well we have
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
documentation that says we offered this
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
as an accommodation
 
01:45:02.310 --> 01:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
and the person refused it and now we're
 
01:45:04.149 --> 01:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
being charged with discrimination
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
okay send that documentation in as your
 
01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:07.350 align:start position:0%
okay send that documentation in as your
response

01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
response
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
and then we go through through it that
 
01:45:11.590 --> 01:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
way so we don't offer legal advice
 
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
we can give people information on our
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
process and we work
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
to remain neutral in the process and to
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
um as much as you can
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
give information on the process without
 
01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
it being representation
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense and i'm hoping that
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
i answered your question representative
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up further question may
 
01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:34.070 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up further question may
inquire

01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
inquire
 
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
okay if if i'm an employer and i have a
 
01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:38.390 align:start position:0%
okay if if i'm an employer and i have a
small

01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
small
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
shop or a real estate job or a financial
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
industry or software development i need
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
to hire a specialist for one position
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
they're irreplaceable and i'm looking at
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
an applicant who is a woman of child
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:58.470 --> 01:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
if i hire her what is
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
the most amount of money that this cost
 
01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:02.709 align:start position:0%
the most amount of money that this cost
me

01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
for it to be a a new hardship under this
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
in other words what's the downside if i
 
01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
hire this person
 
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
what's the worst amount of money that
 
01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have to spend under this
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
under this bill okay and thank you for
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
the redirection
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
um and allow me to clarify so undue
 
01:46:21.679 --> 01:46:22.470 align:start position:0%
um and allow me to clarify so undue
hardship

01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
hardship
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily um qualified by an
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
so it's not just a dollar amount it's
 
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
what is it that you're having to do to
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
attempt to make this accommodation and
 
01:46:37.679 --> 01:46:38.310 align:start position:0%
attempt to make this accommodation and
so

01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
these are the variables that we use
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
every day
 
01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
in general right so this is how we make
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
these determinations now
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
so it's not oh this business has
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know 20 employees and so an undue
 
01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:52.390 align:start position:0%
you know 20 employees and so an undue
hardship

01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
hardship
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
is considered a ten thousand dollar or a
 
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollar
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
expenditure that's that's not what it is
 
01:46:59.280 --> 01:46:59.750 align:start position:0%
expenditure that's that's not what it is
it's

01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:47:02.709 --> 01:47:02.719 align:start position:0%
what is reasonable to accommodate this
 
01:47:02.719 --> 01:47:03.830 align:start position:0%
what is reasonable to accommodate this
individual

01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
so um my my lawyer friends will
 
01:47:09.669 --> 01:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate this if we all make widgets
 
01:47:12.310 --> 01:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
and we're standing on the widget making
 
01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:13.430 align:start position:0%
and we're standing on the widget making
line

01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
and this person has an accommodation
 
01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
that they need and they need a stool to
 
01:47:19.109 --> 01:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
sit on
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
the employer will can get them a very
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable stool
 
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
to sit on to use that as needed
 
01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:27.679 align:start position:0%
on the widget making line but the
 
01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
employee is saying
 
01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
i don't want that one i want the solid
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
gold one
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
that when i clap it'll lift me up and
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
scoot me down
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
to the next side and throw away my trash
 
01:47:40.470 --> 01:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
for me that's the one i want
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
well the employer is not under any
 
01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:44.709 align:start position:0%
well the employer is not under any
obligation

01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:44.719 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
to purchase the solid gold can move with
 
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
clapping of hands chair
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
they are responsible for purchasing or
 
01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:53.189 align:start position:0%
they are responsible for purchasing or
providing

01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
providing
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
something that is a reasonable uh
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
reasonably expected
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
to assist this person or to accommodate
 
01:48:00.719 --> 01:48:01.350 align:start position:0%
to assist this person or to accommodate
them

01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
to meet the needs of the job description
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
and and making sure that that person can
 
01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:08.390 align:start position:0%
and and making sure that that person can
still

01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
satisfy the essential elements of their
 
01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:14.310 align:start position:0%
satisfy the essential elements of their
job

01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
so let's say you have a warehouse job
 
01:48:17.199 --> 01:48:18.550 align:start position:0%
so let's say you have a warehouse job
that

01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
is seasonal and it's around you know for
 
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
christmas and we need we need this we
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
need a lot of help in the warehouse
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
and is that the employer says
 
01:48:31.590 --> 01:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
well all i call what i need you for is
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
the warehouse and if you can't lift then
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
you know i this is not going to work so
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
the all i can do is
 
01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
is lay you off and the employee says
 
01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
well i don't want to be laid off because
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to get less money
 
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
you know you know my compensation can be
 
01:48:46.229 --> 01:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
less i don't want to be laid off
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
um is the um how do you fall down on
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
that side
 
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
who who's who who gets the reasonable
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
compen you know
 
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh settlement right so thank you for the
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
question uh representative hunt
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
so ultimately all of this
 
01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
is an interactive process so from
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
beginning to end
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
employee employer are working together
 
01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
to find a reasonable solution to
 
01:49:14.229 --> 01:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that the employee is
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
requesting so
 
01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
when you have a reasonable accommodation
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
for anything
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
under the ada as well as as it relates
 
01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:24.310 align:start position:0%
under the ada as well as as it relates
to

01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
sb 68 if there is something that the
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
employer can provide or assist the
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
employee with
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
to allow them to continue the functions
 
01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
of the job so
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
yes it's a warehouse job but what the
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
employer may have to do is be creative
 
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
is there a different area in the
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
warehouse that the person
 
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
can work for a period of time can the
 
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
shift be moved
 
01:49:53.589 --> 01:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
so that maybe the morning shift has
 
01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
lighter weight items whereas the
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon shift has heavier items
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
and so what the employee and the ploy
 
01:50:00.239 --> 01:50:01.109 align:start position:0%
and so what the employee and the ploy
employer

01:50:01.109 --> 01:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
are to do is to work collaboratively
 
01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
to look for a solution if there is no
 
01:50:10.950 --> 01:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
way for the employer to
 
01:50:15.589 --> 01:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
maintain the employee's status
 
01:50:17.669 --> 01:50:17.679 align:start position:0%
because there is no other shift it's
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
only an eight hour day and
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
we only have this there is no other
 
01:50:22.629 --> 01:50:22.639 align:start position:0%
place then
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
as long as the in the
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
there is really no accommodation that
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
could meet
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
to allow the employee to meet the
 
01:50:35.990 --> 01:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
essential functions of that position
 
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
if that person has to be let go because
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's not reasonable
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
to hire um you and
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative abramson to do my job
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
right so if you're paying me i have to
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
do my job
 
01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
if i can do it with an accommodation
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
great and it's usually
 
01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
only for a limited amount of time anyway
 
01:50:55.119 --> 01:50:55.830 align:start position:0%
only for a limited amount of time anyway
right

01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
and so if there is no way
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
and that person has to be furloughed or
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
something and sometimes you may do a
 
01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
well we need to lay you off for you know
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
six months
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
or three months or whatever but we want
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
you to come back because there just
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
isn't anything then that could be and
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
that person may feel that they are wrong
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
but it's something to remember that
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
every wrong isn't actionable
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
if the employer has followed the letter
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
of the law
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
if they have worked collaboratively with
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
the employee
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
to look for a reasonable solution and
 
01:51:29.589 --> 01:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
there just
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
isn't one to be found if that person
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
must be furloughed
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
they're a great employee and you want
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
them to stay with you you just don't
 
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
have anything for now
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately nothing is perfect right
 
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
so and then to follow up on uh
 
01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
representative abramson's previous
 
01:51:51.199 --> 01:51:52.070 align:start position:0%
representative abramson's previous
questions

01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:51:54.149 --> 01:51:54.159 align:start position:0%
um because it's always been said that
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
that employers
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
generally don't hire women because
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
they're because they are child bearing
 
01:51:58.960 --> 01:51:59.510 align:start position:0%
they're because they are child bearing
and

01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
did or do you fear at all that this is
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
um accelerate that or accentuate that
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
that this be a temptation for employers
 
01:52:10.070 --> 01:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
not to hire
 
01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
women simply because they're fearful of
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
having to go through this process
 
01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
to have to defend why they you know
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
they can't keep this person while
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
they're pregnant
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
um and thank you representative hunt for
 
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
the follow-up so
 
01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
what's in sb 68 is the way that the
 
01:52:28.790 --> 01:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
commission operates
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
to this day so this does not change
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
how we do business as it were so
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
sp 68 is no different than how we've
 
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
been operating with employers in the
 
01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:41.430 align:start position:0%
been operating with employers in the
state

01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
for 50 plus years so there should be no
 
01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:45.910 align:start position:0%
for 50 plus years so there should be no
expectation

01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
expectation
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
that an employer would do something
 
01:52:48.239 --> 01:52:49.109 align:start position:0%
that an employer would do something
adverse

01:52:49.109 --> 01:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
adverse
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
based on the language in sb68 you could
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
go to our website now
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
and find this language um
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
and if you look at any cases that we um
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
have published on our website that
 
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
deal with pregnancy and we don't have a
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
lot of those so that's that's a good
 
01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:05.669 align:start position:0%
lot of those so that's that's a good
sign

01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:05.679 align:start position:0%
sign
 
01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh that we don't have a lot um but that
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
being said
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
there there should be no expectation
 
01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
that employers would
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
would be um prone to
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
being less receptive
 
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
to women of child bearing age
 
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
as the in in the way that they are now
 
01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:27.589 align:start position:0%
as the in in the way that they are now
so

01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
there there should be no concern with
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
that we aren't concerned
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
that it would create uh some some
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
adverse action towards uh pregnant women
 
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
or um women in the age group
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
of pregnancy and that's changed now we
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
have a 57 year old that recently gave
 
01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
birth in new hampshire
 
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
so being a teacher too right child
 
01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
bearing age is a is a different thing
 
01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:48.870 align:start position:0%
bearing age is a is a different thing
now

01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative johnson has a
 
01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:52.950 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative johnson has a
question

01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:53:56.070 --> 01:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so my
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
concern is
 
01:54:02.310 --> 01:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
that if this really isn't an issue and
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
you know i've worked for many different
 
01:54:06.629 --> 01:54:06.639 align:start position:0%
businesses from small but large
 
01:54:09.189 --> 01:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
if well if the employers are already
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
working with their employees
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
why do we need a law on the books
 
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
telling them what to do when they're
 
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
already doing it and if it's already
 
01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:19.510 align:start position:0%
already doing it and if it's already
being

01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:54:22.229 --> 01:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
work you know handled and worked with
 
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
and communicated
 
01:54:26.070 --> 01:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
and you know collaborative with the
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
employee and employee
 
01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
employers and the employees why do we
 
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
need a law
 
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
telling them how to what to do what
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
they're already doing
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
representative johnson thank you very
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
much for the question so
 
01:54:42.629 --> 01:54:42.639 align:start position:0%
um you you have new employers that start
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
um and you have new employees that begin
 
01:54:50.070 --> 01:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
um all the time correct and you also
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
have people who've never been pregnant
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
before that will become pregnant and so
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
these could be concerns
 
01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
so even though overall
 
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
we've had very positive
 
01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh outcomes um we've
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
not had a plethora of pregnancy
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
cases it doesn't hurt to codify this
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
into law so that it's very clear in one
 
01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:19.189 align:start position:0%
into law so that it's very clear in one
area

01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
of our statute as it relates to
 
01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:23.189 align:start position:0%
of our statute as it relates to
pregnancy

01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
um we want to make sure that it's very
 
01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:28.310 align:start position:0%
um we want to make sure that it's very
clear

01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh is there any other questions for
 
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative emerson um
 
01:55:40.709 --> 01:55:40.719 align:start position:0%
i hope you have one question well it was
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
actually more of a
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
verifying my remarks um i'm i'm trying
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
to break the glass ceiling so i
 
01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
for for the next generation of women i
 
01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:50.229 align:start position:0%
for for the next generation of women i
understand

01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair you know the factory floor
 
01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:55.679 align:start position:0%
making widgets and having to put a chair
 
01:55:56.709 --> 01:55:56.719 align:start position:0%
what about
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
a young woman who wants to become junior
 
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
vice president
 
01:56:03.669 --> 01:56:03.679 align:start position:0%
or a medical specialist or a database
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
specialist or something where it's just
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
one position in that company especially
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
for small businesses we only have one
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
person in that position
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to make accommodations
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
for that and it it it
 
01:56:16.229 --> 01:56:16.239 align:start position:0%
feels like this build away it's written
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
with the uncertainty
 
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
um as is that uh that this would just be
 
01:56:23.109 --> 01:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
yet another obstacle for women who are
 
01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
trying to move up into a position in a
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
company where there's only that just
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
that one position
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
i mean that that's that's why i'm saying
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
is there some way we can rewrite this
 
01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
so that this doesn't put an undue burden
 
01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
on them
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
or on their employer or a small business
 
01:56:41.350 --> 01:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
on new startups
 
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm thinking you know maybe
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
put a cap on it so it's something that's
 
01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:46.390 align:start position:0%
put a cap on it so it's something that's
certain

01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
certain
 
01:56:48.070 --> 01:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars ten thousand
 
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
dollars obviously that they could
 
01:56:50.629 --> 01:56:50.639 align:start position:0%
accommodate with
 
01:56:53.589 --> 01:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
the chair or or adjusting their schedule
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
or bathroom breaks
 
01:56:57.189 --> 01:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
but if they can have an actual dollar
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
figure of some kind
 
01:57:01.030 --> 01:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
then they know this is the limit of how
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
much of a burden this is going to place
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
on the company
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
they can calculate it and they can make
 
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
that decision whether they're retiring
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
or promoting
 
01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative hum if i may respond to
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
that certainly
 
01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and i i really do
 
01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate your concerns uh
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative abramson
 
01:57:23.589 --> 01:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
i i i hear what you're saying the
 
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
difficulty with
 
01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
doing something along those lines um
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
is that every accommodation
 
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
is not something that's financial so
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
it may not entail um hi
 
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
it may not entail uh providing a
 
01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:41.589 align:start position:0%
it may not entail uh providing a
financial

01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
incentive or or purchasing an
 
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
item it it could be a 20 chair
 
01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
it could be just allowing more bathroom
 
01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:51.750 align:start position:0%
it could be just allowing more bathroom
breaks

01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
breaks
 
01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
it could be that the person
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
may need a longer lunch period
 
01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
because after they eat they have to you
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
know they need to take a rest or
 
01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:03.910 align:start position:0%
know they need to take a rest or
something

01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
because there's some other physical
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
situation so
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
those are things that don't require
 
01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
money and
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
and a large amount of these things are
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
things that
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
that don't require money at all um so
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
in putting in something a financial
 
01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:23.589 align:start position:0%
in putting in something a financial
piece

01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
what it it it opens up an area that
 
01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:27.030 align:start position:0%
what it it it opens up an area that
isn't

01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
really necessary um and i
 
01:58:32.070 --> 01:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
under i i promise you i hear your
 
01:58:33.910 --> 01:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
concerns because you're wanting to make
 
01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:34.709 align:start position:0%
concerns because you're wanting to make
sure

01:58:34.709 --> 01:58:34.719 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
that a business can understand in a
 
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
financial way what a reasonable
 
01:58:40.950 --> 01:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
accommodation is
 
01:58:43.830 --> 01:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
however a large majority of reasonable
 
01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:45.270 align:start position:0%
however a large majority of reasonable
accommodations

01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
accommodations
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
may not require money at all so
 
01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
it leaves it to the commission as we
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
are the enforcement agency to under to
 
01:58:58.550 --> 01:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
um to extrapolate what reasonable
 
01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
is um and as senator hennessey said you
 
01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
know each person's reasonable is a
 
01:59:05.189 --> 01:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
little different or each person's
 
01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
request is a little different
 
01:59:08.790 --> 01:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
one person's reasonable accommodation is
 
01:59:11.350 --> 01:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
literally just a stool to sit on or
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh extra bathroom breaks someone else is
 
01:59:13.679 --> 01:59:14.709 align:start position:0%
uh extra bathroom breaks someone else is
reasonable

01:59:14.709 --> 01:59:14.719 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
is that they need an office that's
 
01:59:18.870 --> 01:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
closer to the elevator
 
01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't mean that a business is
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
expected to purchase
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
or build out a new office but what
 
01:59:27.910 --> 01:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
can we empty out this room clean it up
 
01:59:29.589 --> 01:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
and make this the office
 
01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
for for that particular employee so what
 
01:59:33.669 --> 01:59:33.679 align:start position:0%
it does by
 
01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
not putting a dollar amount it allow it
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
gives the commission
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
flexibility to to entertain
 
01:59:44.229 --> 01:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
what is reasonable what is a reasonable
 
01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
standard with this particular situation
 
01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:47.910 align:start position:0%
standard with this particular situation
because

01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
if i am you know for example if i'm an
 
01:59:52.149 --> 01:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
unreasonable employee
 
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
and there's a dollar amount put on there
 
01:59:55.830 --> 01:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
then says well i'm only asking for
 
01:59:57.510 --> 01:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
something that's two thousand dollars
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
it's not ten and that's the limit so you
 
02:00:02.229 --> 02:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
should be able to grant this
 
02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
but that two thousand dollar request
 
02:00:08.070 --> 02:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
might not financially let's say that
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
might not be unreasonable but what
 
02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
they're asking for
 
02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
is unreasonable when they were offered
 
02:00:14.709 --> 02:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
something that was
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
perfectly reasonable but because it
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't what the
 
02:00:21.270 --> 02:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
employee wanted we don't we don't judge
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
reasonableness by
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
what i what i would prefer you know of
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
course i'd prefer an easy boy lounge
 
02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:28.070 align:start position:0%
course i'd prefer an easy boy lounge
chair

02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
but the business is not required to
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
provide that for me
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
they're pro they're required to provide
 
02:00:36.239 --> 02:00:36.550 align:start position:0%
they're pro they're required to provide
a

02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation a comfortable
 
02:00:41.189 --> 02:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
chair for which i need to sit
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
they're not required to purchase a
 
02:00:44.550 --> 02:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
twelve hundred or
 
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollar chair and so by and
 
02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:47.750 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollar chair and so by and
i

02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
again i completely understand what
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
you're asking however by
 
02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
adding dollar amounts in there i think
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
we start
 
02:00:57.030 --> 02:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
to change the conversation and
 
02:00:59.350 --> 02:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
we've not had to my recollection and i
 
02:01:01.589 --> 02:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
can double check this and certainly get
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
back to you
 
02:01:06.629 --> 02:01:06.639 align:start position:0%
we've not had a reasonable accommodation
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
in a pregnancy case where there was some
 
02:01:09.599 --> 02:01:10.070 align:start position:0%
in a pregnancy case where there was some
huge

02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
huge
 
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
dollar amount i mean it's usually small
 
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
things that are needed
 
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
and some cases are solved with mediation
 
02:01:20.070 --> 02:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
once the small and a lot of times just
 
02:01:21.750 --> 02:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
small businesses that just aren't sure
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
what they're supposed to do
 
02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
so through conversation they understand
 
02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
oh okay well i can do this or i should
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
do this
 
02:01:33.109 --> 02:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
representative patrick uh do you have a
 
02:01:35.599 --> 02:01:36.229 align:start position:0%
representative patrick uh do you have a
question

02:01:36.229 --> 02:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's a very it's a it's a very it's a
 
02:01:40.709 --> 02:01:40.719 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
02:01:43.109 --> 02:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
well i just realized that i i screwed up
 
02:01:44.070 --> 02:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
there were two
 
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
people who were in opposition to the
 
02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
bill and i somehow missed them
 
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
um so uh maybe we should hear from them
 
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh but let you does you want to go ahead
 
02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
with your would you believe
 
02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh mrs nalakai would you believe i now
 
02:02:00.629 --> 02:02:00.639 align:start position:0%
have a better understanding
 
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
of reasonableness that was my main
 
02:02:04.870 --> 02:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
question when i went through this and
 
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
when you started
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
but now i have a much better
 
02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:09.030 align:start position:0%
but now i have a much better
understanding

02:02:09.030 --> 02:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
of reasonables thank you very much for
 
02:02:12.629 --> 02:02:12.639 align:start position:0%

02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
hi chairman hunt it's so good to see you
 
02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
again i wish i was in the
 
02:03:06.709 --> 02:03:06.719 align:start position:0%
hearing committee room with you all um
 
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
my name is kate frederick and
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
i am opposing this bill because i think
 
02:03:14.950 --> 02:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
it's too vague and i think it will cause
 
02:03:16.229 --> 02:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of confusion
 
02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
for employers to know what they're
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
supposed to do
 
02:03:21.990 --> 02:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
and what they don't have to do and i
 
02:03:24.550 --> 02:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
think it'll cause conflict for employees
 
02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
who think they have a right but maybe
 
02:03:28.070 --> 02:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
don't or have a right
 
02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:29.679 align:start position:0%
but can't prove it because everything's
 
02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
too big
 
02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
um i am
 
02:03:39.189 --> 02:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:41.350 --> 02:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
i also attend classes at dartmouth's
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
medical school and public health
 
02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:53.189 --> 02:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
i experienced pregnancy discrimination
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
while i worked as a child support
 
02:03:59.350 --> 02:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire i had
 
02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
two medical conditions gestational
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
diabetes which is diabetes while you're
 
02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:09.030 align:start position:0%
diabetes which is diabetes while you're
pregnant

02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
caused by pregnancy hormones i had a
 
02:04:12.709 --> 02:04:12.719 align:start position:0%
severe case
 
02:04:16.069 --> 02:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
and i required four
 
02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
shots of insulin a day self-administered
 
02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
multiple finger pricks to test my blood
 
02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:25.030 align:start position:0%
multiple finger pricks to test my blood
sugar

02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
sugar
 
02:04:28.550 --> 02:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
exercise after i ate to bring down my
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:35.350 --> 02:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
i was also anemic i had low iron levels
 
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
which made me extremely
 
02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:39.910 align:start position:0%
which made me extremely
tired

02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
and i experienced pregnancy
 
02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination from my supervisor who
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
was a woman
 
02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
who had had a child and i reported her
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:57.270 --> 02:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
i received nasty comments from my
 
02:04:57.280 --> 02:04:59.109 align:start position:0%
i received nasty comments from my
supervisor

02:04:59.109 --> 02:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
supervisor
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
um that led to further discrimination
 
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
after i had
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
my baby
 
02:05:11.189 --> 02:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
so i do see the need for more specific
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
language for what
 
02:05:15.669 --> 02:05:15.679 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodations are what
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
undo hardship is and
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
what reasonable means so i
 
02:05:26.069 --> 02:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
submitted a report that i co-authored
 
02:05:29.109 --> 02:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
um to you all by email
 
02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
i want to refer you to page 25.
 
02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
this really starts on page 24 but page
 
02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:38.229 align:start position:0%
this really starts on page 24 but page
25

02:05:38.229 --> 02:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
25
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:46.629 --> 02:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
and i have a full page
 
02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
to define what undo hardship is how it
 
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
is applied
 
02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
how employers can use it what
 
02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
calculations they use
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
etc so i would refer you to that page
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
when you're making your decision
 
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
um it basically looks at
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
the budget of the employer and they
 
02:06:07.109 --> 02:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
compare it to the accommodation that is
 
02:06:07.119 --> 02:06:08.470 align:start position:0%
compare it to the accommodation that is
requested

02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
requested
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
there are several caveats in there about
 
02:06:15.430 --> 02:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
how you can't use undo hardship for
 
02:06:20.229 --> 02:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
i would also like to refer you to page
 
02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:28.709 align:start position:0%
i would also like to refer you to page
26

02:06:28.709 --> 02:06:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
letter f to find reasonable
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
accommodation i think just saying
 
02:06:32.639 --> 02:06:33.510 align:start position:0%
accommodation i think just saying
reasonable

02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
02:06:37.109 --> 02:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
is terrible i think you need to use an
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
actual definition
 
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
so i provided you with the one from the
 
02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:41.830 align:start position:0%
so i provided you with the one from the
american

02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
american
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
with disabilities act and as
 
02:06:52.149 --> 02:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is considered a temporary
 
02:06:54.320 --> 02:06:55.350 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is considered a temporary
disability

02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
disability
 
02:06:57.669 --> 02:06:57.679 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire in other states
 
02:06:58.870 --> 02:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is not
 
02:07:01.350 --> 02:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
an automatic disability but in new
 
02:07:04.629 --> 02:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:07.750 --> 02:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
so this offers the definition of
 
02:07:09.510 --> 02:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation from
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
the american with disabilities act it
 
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:12.550 align:start position:0%
the american with disabilities act it
also

02:07:12.550 --> 02:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
provides a definition through the us
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
department of justice
 
02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
and it also provides a separate
 
02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
definition under the federal
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
nursing mothers provision
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
that is enforced by the united states
 
02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
the federal law of the pregnancy
 
02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
is what the state law
 
02:07:45.669 --> 02:07:45.679 align:start position:0%
has to also meet you can't create a law
 
02:07:48.069 --> 02:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
a state law that has less provisions
 
02:07:50.950 --> 02:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
less protective provisions
 
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
than the federal law um
 
02:07:56.550 --> 02:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
i think probably attorney sarah braffman
 
02:07:56.560 --> 02:07:58.149 align:start position:0%
i think probably attorney sarah braffman
can

02:07:58.149 --> 02:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
explain additional legal points um so i
 
02:08:02.310 --> 02:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to take up too much of your
 
02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:03.350 align:start position:0%
don't want to take up too much of your
time

02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:08:06.629 --> 02:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
um i would suggest the following
 
02:08:09.669 --> 02:08:09.679 align:start position:0%
i have talked to the governor's office
 
02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
i spoke with elliot gould i requested
 
02:08:16.229 --> 02:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
instead of this bill i requested
 
02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
that the governor establish a governor's
 
02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:21.109 align:start position:0%
that the governor establish a governor's
council

02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
council
 
02:08:23.589 --> 02:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
on pregnancy and lactation
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the workplace
 
02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
explicitly and that
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
this bill could be amended by that
 
02:08:33.119 --> 02:08:33.910 align:start position:0%
this bill could be amended by that
council

02:08:33.910 --> 02:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
council
 
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
and it would have the voices of
 
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
employers it would have the voices of
 
02:08:39.990 --> 02:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
the administrative agencies involved
 
02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
including the human rights commission it
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
would have the voices of
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
employees who have experienced
 
02:08:47.430 --> 02:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the workplace
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
that have exact examples
 
02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
um and i i think that we could really
 
02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
turn out a better product
 
02:09:04.229 --> 02:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you uh
 
02:09:08.790 --> 02:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes we can um i have
 
02:09:14.790 --> 02:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
essentially the same question i'm an
 
02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:16.149 align:start position:0%
essentially the same question i'm an
employer

02:09:16.149 --> 02:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
employer
 
02:09:19.510 --> 02:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm facing this this mandate and at
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
the same time i'm
 
02:09:24.069 --> 02:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to hire from pooled employees
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh for a for a one-off position whether
 
02:09:27.119 --> 02:09:27.750 align:start position:0%
uh for a for a one-off position whether
it's

02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:09:30.149 --> 02:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
management position or or medical
 
02:09:32.069 --> 02:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
specialist or something else
 
02:09:35.109 --> 02:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
if i'm facing this law and
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
but some of the candidates are are women
 
02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
of childbearing age
 
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
are they going to have a harder time
 
02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:45.350 align:start position:0%
are they going to have a harder time
totally

02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
and chairman hunt actually asked me this
 
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
question several years ago i forgot to
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
mention my legislative history is that
 
02:09:53.430 --> 02:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
i'm the woman that has
 
02:09:56.390 --> 02:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
submitted the original language for the
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
previous seven bills
 
02:10:01.350 --> 02:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
related to pregnancy and lactation
 
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
um so yes chairman
 
02:10:06.870 --> 02:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
had asked me this question early on and
 
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
i had a similar answer
 
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
you know what employers may take this
 
02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:12.069 align:start position:0%
you know what employers may take this
opportunity

02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
very few but some may take this
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to discriminate
 
02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
and then people will miss out on jobs
 
02:10:22.629 --> 02:10:22.639 align:start position:0%
and then maybe they'll have a legal
 
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
cause of action afterwards that'll get
 
02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:26.150 align:start position:0%
settled 10 years down the line
 
02:10:26.150 --> 02:10:27.350 align:start position:0%
settled 10 years down the line
[Music]

02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
my answer back then also was what i'm
 
02:10:30.790 --> 02:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
going to say now
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
the pregnancy discrimination act is
 
02:10:38.310 --> 02:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
already a law that's intended to
 
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
prevent this type of discrimination
 
02:10:44.709 --> 02:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
it makes it discriminatory to not hire
 
02:10:47.589 --> 02:10:47.599 align:start position:0%
somebody based on gender
 
02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
pregnancy status etc and
 
02:10:53.910 --> 02:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
with a good faith effort we you know we
 
02:10:55.750 --> 02:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
believe that i believe that
 
02:10:59.189 --> 02:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
most employers attempt to
 
02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
follow the law and are not intending to
 
02:11:06.069 --> 02:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
intentionally disregard the law
 
02:11:10.149 --> 02:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
for those reasons all
 
02:11:13.109 --> 02:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh we're getting tight on time so sir go
 
02:11:13.119 --> 02:11:13.990 align:start position:0%
uh we're getting tight on time so sir go
ahead

02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
02:11:17.589 --> 02:11:17.599 align:start position:0%
real quick um is it is it possible to
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
put into this bill some kind of dollar
 
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
amount with a thousand dollars or ten
 
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:33.990 --> 02:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
you don't just have you know one company
 
02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:34.790 align:start position:0%
you don't just have you know one company
is

02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:11:37.990 --> 02:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner commission might
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
one year they allow somebody just one
 
02:11:41.430 --> 02:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
company to do
 
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
nothing and another one you've got a
 
02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:44.790 align:start position:0%
nothing and another one you've got a
billion

02:11:44.790 --> 02:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
billion
 
02:11:48.149 --> 02:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
billion dollars sure
 
02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
i mean anything is possible i i think i
 
02:11:52.229 --> 02:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
would defer to
 
02:11:54.550 --> 02:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
director malachi on that she's the one
 
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
that is in charge of enforcing
 
02:12:01.030 --> 02:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
the statute um what i would suggest
 
02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
is because every employer has a
 
02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:05.189 align:start position:0%
is because every employer has a
different

02:12:05.189 --> 02:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:12:10.069 --> 02:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
budget and salary that perhaps a ratio
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
could be more efficient and clear
 
02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
but if there were a governor's council
 
02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
established i think that would be
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh we do have one more question here
 
02:12:26.550 --> 02:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
02:12:28.069 --> 02:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
i'd like to ask a question thank you mr
 
02:12:29.589 --> 02:12:29.599 align:start position:0%
chair so let me get
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
let me get this straight mr frederick
 
02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
you've been here seven times before
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
a bill passed um you don't like this
 
02:12:36.719 --> 02:12:37.350 align:start position:0%
a bill passed um you don't like this
bill

02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
you want a a study commission to make it
 
02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:41.669 align:start position:0%
you want a a study commission to make it
perfect

02:12:41.669 --> 02:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
and you're willing to continue to allow
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
this to
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
um not be on the books
 
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
and that's okay with you because you
 
02:12:55.350 --> 02:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
those words i don't think that's an
 
02:12:58.790 --> 02:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
accurate representation
 
02:13:02.709 --> 02:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
of my intent as director malachi
 
02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
said they've already been doing this
 
02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
since they were established this bill
 
02:13:07.750 --> 02:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't create any new
 
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
provisions or any new accommodations
 
02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
employers are already required to
 
02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
provide accommodations
 
02:13:18.870 --> 02:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
i think hill doesn't do anything new it
 
02:13:23.109 --> 02:13:23.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't offer anything
 
02:13:28.830 --> 02:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
i i certainly appreciate that it is
 
02:13:34.550 --> 02:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
highly counter-intuitive that i would be
 
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
um i'm extremely passionate about
 
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
advocating for pregnancy
 
02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
and breastfeeding rights but i if there
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
were amendments to the bill i would
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
support it
 
02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question okay we
 
02:13:54.550 --> 02:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119 align:start position:0%

thank you representative hunt and um
 
02:14:04.229 --> 02:14:04.239 align:start position:0%

me to testify today
 
02:14:07.669 --> 02:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
my name is sarah brafman and i am an
 
02:14:10.149 --> 02:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
attorney and senior policy counsel at a
 
02:14:11.430 --> 02:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
better balance
 
02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
we are a leading advocacy organization
 
02:14:15.030 --> 02:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
and our expert
 
02:14:17.669 --> 02:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
specifically in workplace pregnancy
 
02:14:17.679 --> 02:14:18.950 align:start position:0%
specifically in workplace pregnancy
accommodations

02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
accommodations
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
we've assisted municipal state and the
 
02:14:23.189 --> 02:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
on the issue of pregnancy accommodations
 
02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
we've helped draft we've helped
 
02:14:29.350 --> 02:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
implement we've helped enforce new laws
 
02:14:31.270 --> 02:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
there are now 30 states that have
 
02:14:33.109 --> 02:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
greater protections for pregnant workers
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
in need of accommodation
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
and i will say in new hampshire we we
 
02:14:39.990 --> 02:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
run a free legal helpline as well where
 
02:14:41.589 --> 02:14:41.599 align:start position:0%
workers from around the country call us
 
02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
with questions and we do hear from
 
02:14:44.870 --> 02:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
workers in new hampshire who are
 
02:14:46.229 --> 02:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
pregnant and struggling to get
 
02:14:46.239 --> 02:14:47.350 align:start position:0%
pregnant and struggling to get
accommodations

02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
accommodations
 
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
just to the question of whether this is
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
an issue or not we do hear from new
 
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire workers and
 
02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
i consulted with my colleagues just
 
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
before this um
 
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
and we have in you know just the past
 
02:15:02.149 --> 02:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
um recent recent past hurt from three
 
02:15:04.229 --> 02:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire workers around this issue
 
02:15:04.239 --> 02:15:05.350 align:start position:0%
new hampshire workers around this issue
specifically

02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
and i really want to thank senator
 
02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:08.390 align:start position:0%
and i really want to thank senator
hennessey

02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
hennessey
 
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
for lifting up this issue for her deep
 
02:15:12.310 --> 02:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
commitment to pregnant workers
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
and the same goes for the commission as
 
02:15:15.750 --> 02:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
well we've actually spoken with the
 
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
commission about this bill
 
02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
um and i think the intent is good you
 
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
heard senator hennessy say
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
to one of the questions our intent is
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
that reasonable accommodations would be
 
02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:26.149 align:start position:0%
that reasonable accommodations would be
available

02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
even if the pregnant worker doesn't have
 
02:15:29.669 --> 02:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
a disability but the
 
02:15:31.589 --> 02:15:31.599 align:start position:0%
a temporary physical disability is only
 
02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
for a leave of absence
 
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
but the issue is we really have concerns
 
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
that the way the bill is drafted won't
 
02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:40.470 align:start position:0%
that the way the bill is drafted won't
be

02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:15:43.669 --> 02:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
interpreted to read that intent into the
 
02:15:43.679 --> 02:15:44.629 align:start position:0%
interpreted to read that intent into the
bill

02:15:44.629 --> 02:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:15:46.550 --> 02:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
and that's for a couple of reasons so
 
02:15:48.550 --> 02:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
number one is that
 
02:15:50.950 --> 02:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is drafted it could
 
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
look like reasonable accommodations
 
02:15:55.030 --> 02:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
is only available for those with
 
02:15:57.030 --> 02:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
temporary physical disabilities
 
02:15:59.189 --> 02:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
and the reason why that's a problem is
 
02:15:59.199 --> 02:16:00.229 align:start position:0%
and the reason why that's a problem is
because

02:16:00.229 --> 02:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
for many pregnant workers and the
 
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
examples that senator hennessy gave
 
02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
needing a water bottle on a job needing
 
02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
a bathroom break
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
pregnant workers often don't need that
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
because they have a disability
 
02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
but they need that to prevent a
 
02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
disability from arising
 
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
so a lot of women will go to the doctor
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
and their doctor will say
 
02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
please don't lift over 50 pounds because
 
02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
that could cause a complication
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
and that could lead to miscarriage
 
02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
please drink a lot of water because if
 
02:16:28.069 --> 02:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
you don't drink water you will get
 
02:16:28.079 --> 02:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
you don't drink water you will get
dehydrated

02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
dehydrated
 
02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
and that could lead to a uti so it's not
 
02:16:32.230 --> 02:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
that they
 
02:16:33.910 --> 02:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
currently have a disability but that
 
02:16:35.669 --> 02:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
they need an accommodation to prevent
 
02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
the disability
 
02:16:40.709 --> 02:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
and we know that even well-intended
 
02:16:43.589 --> 02:16:43.599 align:start position:0%
agency interpretation can lead to
 
02:16:46.070 --> 02:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
problems so maryland is a good example
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
in maryland they passed a law that said
 
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodations for pregnant
 
02:16:51.429 --> 02:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
workers with disabilities
 
02:16:53.509 --> 02:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
the agency had a very broad
 
02:16:54.870 --> 02:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that
 
02:16:57.429 --> 02:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
even things that might not rise to the
 
02:16:59.750 --> 02:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
level of disability under federal law
 
02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:00.469 align:start position:0%
level of disability under federal law
could

02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:17:02.790 --> 02:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
meet the maryland could meet the
 
02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
maryland standard under that statute
 
02:17:07.349 --> 02:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
but three years later a court came down
 
02:17:09.030 --> 02:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
and courts don't have to follow
 
02:17:11.429 --> 02:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
agency interpretation and the court said
 
02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
well this pregnant worker
 
02:17:14.549 --> 02:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a disability in the more
 
02:17:16.389 --> 02:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
traditional sense of the word right like
 
02:17:17.910 --> 02:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
having a complication
 
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
that rises to the level of disability
 
02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:17:23.589 --> 02:17:23.599 align:start position:0%
she doesn't get the accommodation and
 
02:17:24.549 --> 02:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
then there's the
 
02:17:26.790 --> 02:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
sort of third problem which is that most
 
02:17:27.990 --> 02:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
workers and most workers
 
02:17:30.629 --> 02:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
we hear from will never go to an agency
 
02:17:32.549 --> 02:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
they will never bring a case in court
 
02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
and all they have to go on is the
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
employer and employee relationship
 
02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
and employers are going to see in the
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
statute that a pregnant worker
 
02:17:42.389 --> 02:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
has to have a disability in order to
 
02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
receive an accommodation
 
02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
and i'll say that pregnant that
 
02:17:48.309 --> 02:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
employers as well have been wanting
 
02:17:49.669 --> 02:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
clarity in the law
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
around when do i have to provide an
 
02:17:53.349 --> 02:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
accommodation and when don't i have to
 
02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
provide an accommodation
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
and that's why the us chamber of
 
02:17:58.309 --> 02:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
commerce is supporting
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
a federal fix around pregnancy
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
accommodations that's why we've had
 
02:18:03.669 --> 02:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
business support in other states
 
02:18:06.629 --> 02:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
around making sure to say that pregnancy
 
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
is not a disability
 
02:18:10.230 --> 02:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
very very clearly in the statutes so
 
02:18:11.669 --> 02:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
that we don't have problems
 
02:18:13.349 --> 02:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
and the same goes if the commission if
 
02:18:14.870 --> 02:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
there's a change in administration and
 
02:18:16.309 --> 02:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
there's a new agency
 
02:18:17.509 --> 02:18:17.519 align:start position:0%
they might not take the same
 
02:18:19.509 --> 02:18:19.519 align:start position:0%
interpretation and you have
 
02:18:21.910 --> 02:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
their the commission really i think is
 
02:18:24.230 --> 02:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
very dedicated to making sure pregnant
 
02:18:24.950 --> 02:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
women can
 
02:18:27.190 --> 02:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
get the accommodations that they need
 
02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
but it's if there's a way to slightly
 
02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:29.910 align:start position:0%
but it's if there's a way to slightly
tweak

02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
tweak
 
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
the statute and to tweak the legislation
 
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
to make it abundantly clear
 
02:18:35.830 --> 02:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
that a pregnant worker doesn't have to
 
02:18:38.070 --> 02:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
have a disability you know we would
 
02:18:39.910 --> 02:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
we think that would really take it to
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
the next step and there's very simple
 
02:18:43.509 --> 02:18:43.519 align:start position:0%
ways of doing this so right now
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
the statute reasonable accommodation
 
02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:47.589 align:start position:0%
the statute reasonable accommodation
statute

02:18:47.589 --> 02:18:47.599 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
354 a2 in the definitions there's a
 
02:18:52.070 --> 02:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
definition of reasonable accommodation
 
02:18:54.309 --> 02:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
there's a definition of undue hardship
 
02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
and the definition of reasonable
 
02:18:55.760 --> 02:18:56.469 align:start position:0%
and the definition of reasonable
accommodation

02:18:56.469 --> 02:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
02:18:59.110 --> 02:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
says that it must be an individual with
 
02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
a disability
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
and so we propose a much
 
02:19:06.389 --> 02:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
shorter very succinct definition to go
 
02:19:08.549 --> 02:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
into this statute into this bill itself
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
in 354 a7
 
02:19:12.549 --> 02:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
to say for the purposes of this
 
02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
subsection the term reasonable
 
02:19:15.429 --> 02:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
accommodation means
 
02:19:17.349 --> 02:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
any change or modification in the work
 
02:19:17.359 --> 02:19:18.469 align:start position:0%
any change or modification in the work
environment

02:19:18.469 --> 02:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
environment
 
02:19:20.629 --> 02:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
or the normal course of business and to
 
02:19:21.669 --> 02:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
leave in place
 
02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
the undue hardship standard around um
 
02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:25.270 align:start position:0%
the undue hardship standard around um
that's

02:19:25.270 --> 02:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's the same in the statute and to
 
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
your point representative abramson
 
02:19:31.030 --> 02:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
we do have an undue hardship standard
 
02:19:33.030 --> 02:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
already in the new hampshire code
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
that has four factors that employers
 
02:19:36.150 --> 02:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
have to meet
 
02:19:38.230 --> 02:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
and i do worry a little bit if we go in
 
02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
and change the undue hardship standard
 
02:19:40.950 --> 02:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
for pregnancy
 
02:19:42.629 --> 02:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
that we're putting pregnant workers at a
 
02:19:44.469 --> 02:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
disadvantage over workers with
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
disability because we don't have a cap
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
on the number figure for disa for
 
02:19:50.790 --> 02:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
accommodations for disability
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
but we but if we put in a cap for
 
02:19:55.349 --> 02:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
pregnancy we run into potential problems
 
02:19:55.359 --> 02:19:55.830 align:start position:0%
pregnancy we run into potential problems
and

02:19:55.830 --> 02:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:58.230 --> 02:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
potential problems yeah that i think
 
02:19:59.910 --> 02:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
could could result for employers
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
honestly if they're
 
02:20:03.110 --> 02:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know providing accommodations for
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities on one hand but the under
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
hardship standard is different but
 
02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
here um it's not for pregnant workers
 
02:20:10.790 --> 02:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
and then the other tweak that we would
 
02:20:10.800 --> 02:20:11.270 align:start position:0%
and then the other tweak that we would
suggest

02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
02:20:13.429 --> 02:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
is really just adding a couple commas
 
02:20:15.030 --> 02:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
and one and a couple words
 
02:20:16.710 --> 02:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
which is to say an employer shall
 
02:20:18.870 --> 02:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
provide reasonable accommodations
 
02:20:21.429 --> 02:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
comma including permitting a female
 
02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
employee to take a leave of absence
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
for the period of temporary physic
 
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
physical disability
 
02:20:30.070 --> 02:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
comma for the the known limitations
 
02:20:31.990 --> 02:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
resulting from pregnancy childbirth or
 
02:20:33.510 --> 02:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
related medical conditions
 
02:20:36.389 --> 02:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
and by putting into the statute known
 
02:20:36.399 --> 02:20:37.830 align:start position:0%
and by putting into the statute known
limitations

02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
02:20:39.790 --> 02:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
then we are making clear that for
 
02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:41.110 align:start position:0%
then we are making clear that for
accommodations

02:20:41.110 --> 02:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
accommodations
 
02:20:42.790 --> 02:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
it does not need to rise for to the
 
02:20:44.710 --> 02:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
level of disability but that for the
 
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
leave of absence
 
02:20:47.110 --> 02:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
you would still need a period of
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
temporary physical disability
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
and the last thing i'll say um and i'm
 
02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions and and happy to
 
02:20:55.110 --> 02:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
have a colloquy with miss malachi as
 
02:20:55.120 --> 02:20:55.750 align:start position:0%
have a colloquy with miss malachi as
well

02:20:55.750 --> 02:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:20:58.950 --> 02:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
is that the the statute does say
 
02:21:01.030 --> 02:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
for and i'm sorry i'm just going to pull
 
02:21:02.550 --> 02:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
it up because i don't want to quote
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
without being prepared but it says for
 
02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
all other employment related purposes
 
02:21:08.950 --> 02:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
including receipt of benefits under
 
02:21:10.389 --> 02:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
fringe benefit programs
 
02:21:12.389 --> 02:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
pregnancy childbirth and related medical
 
02:21:14.469 --> 02:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
conditions shall be considered temporary
 
02:21:15.750 --> 02:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities so
 
02:21:17.670 --> 02:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the commission
 
02:21:19.510 --> 02:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
is interpreting pregnancy
 
02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
to mean a temporary physical disability
 
02:21:23.349 --> 02:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
but the statute goes on to say
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
affected by pregnancy childbirth-related
 
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
medical conditions shall be treated in
 
02:21:28.710 --> 02:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
the same manner as
 
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
any employee affected by any other
 
02:21:32.309 --> 02:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
temporary disability
 
02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
and that language really comes from the
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
pregnancy discrimination act
 
02:21:38.230 --> 02:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
where in order to get accommodations you
 
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
need to compare yourself to another
 
02:21:42.389 --> 02:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
employee who's getting accommodations
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
but what we're trying to do here and
 
02:21:45.670 --> 02:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
what the pregnancy accommodation laws
 
02:21:46.469 --> 02:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
around the country
 
02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
are trying to do that that have already
 
02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
been enacted is to take out that
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
comparator standard
 
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
and to make very clear you just have to
 
02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
have to have known limitations
 
02:21:56.790 --> 02:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
and you have to engage in this
 
02:21:58.630 --> 02:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
interactive process to get the
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
and then if it's an undue hardship then
 
02:22:04.150 --> 02:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
they don't need to provide that
 
02:22:05.910 --> 02:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to go into how other
 
02:22:07.910 --> 02:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
states have kind of
 
02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
used this language some states have used
 
02:22:11.590 --> 02:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
the term known limitations
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we're moving towards in the
 
02:22:14.950 --> 02:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
federal legislation so if state and
 
02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:15.429 align:start position:0%
federal legislation so if state and
federal

02:22:15.429 --> 02:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
are aligned you know known limitations
 
02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
is what we're suggesting
 
02:22:20.950 --> 02:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
here so that they would align if that
 
02:22:22.469 --> 02:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
bill passes but
 
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
other states you know massachusetts
 
02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
vermont they use pregnancy-related
 
02:22:28.150 --> 02:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
conditions so they don't use
 
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
no limitation but they use
 
02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
pregnancy-related condition
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
um so that's an option um other states
 
02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:35.270 align:start position:0%
um so that's an option um other states
use

02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:22:37.670 --> 02:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
medical need instead of disability so
 
02:22:39.190 --> 02:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
there's an array of options
 
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
and they really are what we're
 
02:22:42.550 --> 02:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
suggesting is a slight tweak
 
02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
to it to the bill which i think would um
 
02:22:48.389 --> 02:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
really align with what senator hennessey
 
02:22:50.550 --> 02:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
is trying to do and i think we can align
 
02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
the really amazing intent that's here
 
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
with the language itself that's in the
 
02:22:54.800 --> 02:22:55.270 align:start position:0%
with the language itself that's in the
bill

02:22:55.270 --> 02:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:22:58.150 --> 02:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
and and harmonize them um so i'll stop
 
02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
there and
 
02:23:01.670 --> 02:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions um i'm also
 
02:23:03.349 --> 02:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
happy to talk about one of the recent
 
02:23:03.359 --> 02:23:04.230 align:start position:0%
happy to talk about one of the recent
cases

02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
cases
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire where a court did find
 
02:23:09.270 --> 02:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
that a pregnancy that pregnancy was a
 
02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:10.230 align:start position:0%
that a pregnancy that pregnancy was a
disability

02:23:10.230 --> 02:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
disability
 
02:23:11.670 --> 02:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
which kind of took a different approach
 
02:23:13.590 --> 02:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
than the commission does so it shows how
 
02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:14.309 align:start position:0%
than the commission does so it shows how
courts

02:23:14.309 --> 02:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
courts
 
02:23:15.990 --> 02:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
really kind of follow their own path and
 
02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's why having clarity in the statute
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
itself is incredibly important
 
02:23:24.469 --> 02:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
thank you great thank you
 
02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
um so we do have
 
02:23:30.550 --> 02:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
the question representative mclaren
 
02:23:31.990 --> 02:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
um mrs braffman you sound extremely
 
02:23:38.630 --> 02:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
up on this whole thing um
 
02:23:40.309 --> 02:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
i personally would hate to be in a
 
02:23:42.630 --> 02:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
position that i would vote against this
 
02:23:42.640 --> 02:23:43.990 align:start position:0%
position that i would vote against this
bill

02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:23:46.469 --> 02:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
hypothetically could you write a
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
amendment could you personally write an
 
02:23:48.479 --> 02:23:49.429 align:start position:0%
amendment could you personally write an
amendment

02:23:49.429 --> 02:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
that covers what you're talking about
 
02:23:55.270 --> 02:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
that i could sponsor and add to the bill
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
that would uh would make this bill
 
02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
passable by all
 
02:24:02.309 --> 02:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
again i would hate to be in a position
 
02:24:02.319 --> 02:24:03.750 align:start position:0%
again i would hate to be in a position
where

02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:24:06.230 --> 02:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
um they don't know that it doesn't go
 
02:24:06.870 --> 02:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
far enough
 
02:24:09.670 --> 02:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
and therefore i'm voting against it uh
 
02:24:11.910 --> 02:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's a terrible position to be in
 
02:24:14.950 --> 02:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
could you do that yes and it's
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
it's ready to go so i'm happy to email
 
02:24:18.150 --> 02:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
it to
 
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative hunt as we speak um
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's very i know that we want to
 
02:24:25.030 --> 02:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
streamline it i think
 
02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
it really puts it in a place where it's
 
02:24:29.270 --> 02:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
aligned with senator hennessey and with
 
02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
miss malachi and i will say
 
02:24:33.590 --> 02:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
i know and we did testify in the senate
 
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
and that i
 
02:24:37.349 --> 02:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
i completely understand i'm not from new
 
02:24:38.790 --> 02:24:38.800 align:start position:0%

02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:40.800 align:start position:0%

02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire they have heard these
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
concerns as well
 
02:24:48.870 --> 02:24:48.880 align:start position:0%

02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
the aclu of new hampshire devin chaffee
 
02:24:53.110 --> 02:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
she couldn't be here today just because
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
of a conflict but she
 
02:24:56.710 --> 02:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
is in support of the amendment the aclu
 
02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
is in support of this amendment
 
02:24:59.910 --> 02:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
um and would like to have further
 
02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
conversation so i'm not here
 
02:25:04.070 --> 02:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
trying to say let's not pass this bill i
 
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
want i
 
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
we would love to see this bill pass we
 
02:25:08.550 --> 02:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
just want to see it pass in the right
 
02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:08.950 align:start position:0%
just want to see it pass in the right
way

02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
and if we could have these discussions
 
02:25:13.030 --> 02:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
to to introduce this amendment and put
 
02:25:14.309 --> 02:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
this in and make it
 
02:25:16.469 --> 02:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
a strong the strong bill that it could
 
02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
be we want to get there with you
 
02:25:20.790 --> 02:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
but i will say there have been times
 
02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
when you know we are here to support
 
02:25:25.190 --> 02:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
pregnant workers we want clarity that is
 
02:25:28.150 --> 02:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
the main thrust of our organization but
 
02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:28.630 align:start position:0%
the main thrust of our organization but
when

02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:25:31.110 --> 02:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
when the bills don't fulfill their
 
02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
intent and
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
when the policy itself is something
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
we think we need to take a pause and
 
02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
give it a little bit more of a look and
 
02:25:41.429 --> 02:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
when new hampshire organizations are
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
saying that as well
 
02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
we think you know making sure that we
 
02:25:46.230 --> 02:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
can take the time that
 
02:25:48.070 --> 02:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
you know ms chafee said she would really
 
02:25:49.590 --> 02:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
love to have a conversation with miss
 
02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:50.150 align:start position:0%
love to have a conversation with miss
malachi

02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
malachi
 
02:25:51.349 --> 02:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
about this and talk through this
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
amendment um same goes for
 
02:25:56.469 --> 02:25:56.479 align:start position:0%
christina d'alessandro from mom's rising
 
02:25:57.590 --> 02:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:25:59.429 --> 02:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire to talk this through i
 
02:26:01.910 --> 02:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
think it bears a little bit more time
 
02:26:04.710 --> 02:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
to try to get us all on the same page
 
02:26:06.309 --> 02:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
and making sure that it works best
 
02:26:06.319 --> 02:26:07.030 align:start position:0%
and making sure that it works best
because

02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:26:08.790 --> 02:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
we're we are going to be the ones on the
 
02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
ground hearing from workers in new
 
02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:11.270 align:start position:0%
ground hearing from workers in new
hampshire

02:26:11.270 --> 02:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
and still struggling with with a law
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
that isn't that isn't clear
 
02:26:16.309 --> 02:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
and that isn't clear for employers
 
02:26:18.550 --> 02:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
either so i'd be happy
 
02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
to to share that with you representative
 
02:26:21.990 --> 02:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
um so that you can introduce that
 
02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.030 align:start position:0%
um so that you can introduce that
amendment

02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%

02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
to take a look at some of your
 
02:26:31.359 --> 02:26:32.309 align:start position:0%
to take a look at some of your
suggestions

02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
suggestions
 
02:26:34.469 --> 02:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
prior to your testimony and my only
 
02:26:36.150 --> 02:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
question right now is did you present
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
these ideas to the senate
 
02:26:40.469 --> 02:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
prior to their voting we did we
 
02:26:42.389 --> 02:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
presented them and senator whitley
 
02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
um put in an amendment it was we did not
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
have a lot of time to talk with the
 
02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
commission about it and so it was a bit
 
02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
more of a rushed process
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
in doing that i will say we also this
 
02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
amendment that you were sent
 
02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:54.790 align:start position:0%
amendment that you were sent

representative
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
was even trying to streamline more so
 
02:26:59.830 --> 02:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
than we did in the senate to make
 
02:27:02.790 --> 02:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're we're not here
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
02:27:05.670 --> 02:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
do a whole lot we are here to try to
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
fulfill the intent of senator hennessey
 
02:27:10.710 --> 02:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
of the commission um and and trying to
 
02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
make it even more streamlined
 
02:27:16.150 --> 02:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
than that but yes we raised them
 
02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
for the senate as well and
 
02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:19.520 align:start position:0%

02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
manhattan
 
02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh
 
02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm not saying redefine undue
 
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
hardship just for this
 
02:27:33.510 --> 02:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
particular section this particular
 
02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:34.790 align:start position:0%
particular section this particular
provision

02:27:34.790 --> 02:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
provision
 
02:27:36.389 --> 02:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying is why not just delete
 
02:27:38.150 --> 02:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
that whole phrase where it starts with
 
02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
on line nine
 
02:27:41.429 --> 02:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
unless such employer can demonstrate
 
02:27:43.349 --> 02:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
that the accommodation would impose an
 
02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
undue hardship on the operation of the
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
employer's business
 
02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
and just set a clear predictable cap i
 
02:27:49.910 --> 02:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
don't know a thousand dollars per
 
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
employee or ten thousand dollars
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
or some amount where it's predictable
 
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
where the employer
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
knows what's the worst case scenario
 
02:27:58.630 --> 02:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
that they might be
 
02:28:00.790 --> 02:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
hit with so if the accommodations being
 
02:28:02.309 --> 02:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
requested could cost
 
02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
20 or 30 000 in overtime or it could
 
02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
cost them
 
02:28:07.110 --> 02:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
you know hundreds of thousands of
 
02:28:09.910 --> 02:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
dollars in structural change in
 
02:28:13.270 --> 02:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
their business can we just put that
 
02:28:16.630 --> 02:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
okay so you you've asked this question
 
02:28:19.110 --> 02:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
multiple times and i think that she
 
02:28:21.910 --> 02:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh the previous uh testifier did say to
 
02:28:23.670 --> 02:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
you that it needs to be some kind of
 
02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
ratio because
 
02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars to a small you know
 
02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
two-person operation is a lot different
 
02:28:32.710 --> 02:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
than a thousand dollars to a company
 
02:28:34.469 --> 02:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
that has 500 employees
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
so 28 certain you know
 
02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is a thousand dollars per
 
02:28:40.399 --> 02:28:41.750 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is a thousand dollars per
employee

02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
employee
 
02:28:44.790 --> 02:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
or ten thousand dollars per employee no
 
02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
more than that amount
 
02:28:49.590 --> 02:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
per employee so if you have the factory
 
02:28:52.309 --> 02:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
and there are five people who become
 
02:28:53.510 --> 02:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
pregnant you can buy
 
02:28:55.429 --> 02:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
you can buy five chairs that you keep
 
02:28:57.510 --> 02:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
around for a very large factory
 
02:28:59.270 --> 02:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
versus a small shop that has two
 
02:29:01.349 --> 02:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
employees where it becomes impossible
 
02:29:03.429 --> 02:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
for them to do it the cost might be too
 
02:29:04.950 --> 02:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
high for them
 
02:29:07.750 --> 02:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
i will say if i if i may represent one
 
02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:08.630 align:start position:0%
i will say if i if i may represent one
um

02:29:08.630 --> 02:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:11.670 --> 02:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
that the undue hardship standard exists
 
02:29:15.349 --> 02:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
in every bill every law that we now have
 
02:29:18.469 --> 02:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
on this and it has not come up as
 
02:29:22.230 --> 02:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
an issue so i i fully respect the
 
02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
wanting clarity but on this particular
 
02:29:26.070 --> 02:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
issue i think
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
we are trying to have an individualized
 
02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
process between
 
02:29:32.870 --> 02:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
employer and employee and in a sense
 
02:29:35.990 --> 02:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
that putting that cap on can
 
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
almost impede that individualized
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
process that they can undergo which i
 
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
i think miss malachi was was emphasizing
 
02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:29:45.750 --> 02:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
and again you have this you have the
 
02:29:46.950 --> 02:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
standard in place
 
02:29:49.429 --> 02:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
already for 30 years from the americans
 
02:29:50.389 --> 02:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
disabilities act
 
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
around undue hardship so certainly there
 
02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
are regulations and maybe
 
02:29:56.070 --> 02:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
it bears giving hypotheticals and
 
02:29:57.990 --> 02:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
examples of what could constitute an
 
02:29:58.870 --> 02:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
undue hardship
 
02:30:00.469 --> 02:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
and i'm you know we'd certainly be in
 
02:30:02.230 --> 02:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
favor of that you know if it's a small
 
02:30:02.240 --> 02:30:03.030 align:start position:0%
favor of that you know if it's a small
employer

02:30:03.030 --> 02:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
employer
 
02:30:05.349 --> 02:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
to kind of tease out but i think that
 
02:30:06.950 --> 02:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
that is better served
 
02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
for for a regulatory function than it is
 
02:30:12.309 --> 02:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
for bearing it out in the statute itself
 
02:30:13.349 --> 02:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about an
 
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
individualized process
 
02:30:16.469 --> 02:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
and because you have a multiple factor
 
02:30:21.190 --> 02:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative ammon has a
 
02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:28.710 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative ammon has a
question

02:30:28.710 --> 02:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:30.230 --> 02:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:30:32.389 --> 02:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
my question um
 
02:30:33.990 --> 02:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
could you tell us where you're located
 
02:30:35.990 --> 02:30:36.000 align:start position:0%

02:30:36.950 --> 02:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:30:39.910 --> 02:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you sure i am currently located in
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
washington dc
 
02:30:44.309 --> 02:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
um we have offices in we're
 
02:30:45.670 --> 02:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
headquartered in new york city we have
 
02:30:47.110 --> 02:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
offices in washington dc
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
nashville and denver colorado um we

are not based in new hampshire um but we
 
02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
like i mentioned
 
02:30:58.230 --> 02:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
we run a free legal helpline and
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
we hear from workers around the country
 
02:31:01.750 --> 02:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
who are having issues
 
02:31:03.670 --> 02:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
around getting accommodations in the
 
02:31:05.910 --> 02:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
workplace and so we have
 
02:31:08.870 --> 02:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
heard from workers in new hampshire and
 
02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:09.429 align:start position:0%
heard from workers in new hampshire and
i

02:31:09.429 --> 02:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:31:11.830 --> 02:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
i know of three specifically who have
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
called us
 
02:31:15.670 --> 02:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
in the recent past around issues of
 
02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
needing pregnancy accommodations in the
 
02:31:19.510 --> 02:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
workplace and not being able to get
 
02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
those accommodations
 
02:31:23.590 --> 02:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
and so again i want to emphasize i know
 
02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not from new hampshire but we are
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%

where
 
02:31:55.590 --> 02:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
we are very much in the weeds on it we
 
02:31:56.389 --> 02:31:56.399 align:start position:0%

02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
care about every single pregnant woman
 
02:32:01.270 --> 02:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
pregnant worker who needs an
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
accommodation is able to get one we know
 
02:32:05.030 --> 02:32:05.040 align:start position:0%

02:32:05.040 --> 02:32:05.670 align:start position:0%
that there are some workers in new
hampshire

02:32:05.670 --> 02:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:32:07.910 --> 02:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
that are not able to and we want to be
 
02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
here to support them
 
02:32:14.710 --> 02:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:18.070 --> 02:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh great thank you very much um uh
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
um miss malachi i did promise you that
 
02:32:21.990 --> 02:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
you would have the last
 
02:32:23.670 --> 02:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
oh wait a minute representative michael
 
02:32:26.389 --> 02:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
here you have another question for
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
mr yes thank you mr chairman
 
02:32:32.309 --> 02:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
um while you were talking i'm reading
 
02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
through some of my
 
02:32:36.550 --> 02:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
messages and i've got a message by
 
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
a mr uh what's his name
 
02:32:42.870 --> 02:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
axelman and he says that uh
 
02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
if he were to start a business he would
 
02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
not hire woman
 
02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
because of this if this law went into
 
02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:51.190 align:start position:0%
because of this if this law went into
effect

02:32:51.190 --> 02:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
effect
 
02:32:53.670 --> 02:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
if i understood you to say earlier what
 
02:32:55.750 --> 02:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
he's saying is basically illegal
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's correct so the
 
02:32:59.590 --> 02:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
pregnancy discrimination act
 
02:33:01.830 --> 02:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
under federal law and new hampshire law
 
02:33:01.840 --> 02:33:03.190 align:start position:0%
under federal law and new hampshire law
itself

02:33:03.190 --> 02:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
itself
 
02:33:06.230 --> 02:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
it is illegal to not hire a woman
 
02:33:09.190 --> 02:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
just because she is pregnant um that was
 
02:33:11.110 --> 02:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
made clear in 1978
 
02:33:14.230 --> 02:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
um and i think you know there's a lot of
 
02:33:15.590 --> 02:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
i've heard some discussion
 
02:33:18.830 --> 02:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
about well if we pass this law will that
 
02:33:20.150 --> 02:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
also um
 
02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
lead to employers not hiring pregnant
 
02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
women because they're concerned they
 
02:33:24.950 --> 02:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
could need accommodations
 
02:33:27.349 --> 02:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
so the first thing is that this actually
 
02:33:29.349 --> 02:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
is a workforce retention issue
 
02:33:30.870 --> 02:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
we are trying to make sure that women
 
02:33:33.510 --> 02:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
can stay healthy and working women
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know 88 of women who are working
 
02:33:37.910 --> 02:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
stay through their third trimester
 
02:33:40.550 --> 02:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
women want and need to keep working
 
02:33:41.830 --> 02:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
during their pregnancies
 
02:33:43.750 --> 02:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
but often a small needing a small
 
02:33:45.429 --> 02:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
accommodation can lead to their being
 
02:33:46.630 --> 02:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
pushed out of the workforce
 
02:33:48.790 --> 02:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
this is actually a way to keep women in
 
02:33:49.990 --> 02:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
the workforce and attached to the
 
02:33:51.190 --> 02:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
workforce and that's why
 
02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
the bill has had such bipartisan support
 
02:33:54.309 --> 02:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
in so many places
 
02:33:57.270 --> 02:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
and the second piece is that you know
 
02:33:57.280 --> 02:33:57.990 align:start position:0%
and the second piece is that you know
pregnancy

02:33:57.990 --> 02:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
02:34:01.030 --> 02:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
accommodations are often very small and
 
02:34:03.270 --> 02:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
they you know it we're talking about
 
02:34:04.870 --> 02:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
very minor things
 
02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
but i think there is a social aspect to
 
02:34:07.910 --> 02:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
it you know when
 
02:34:09.590 --> 02:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
when the pregnancy discrimination act
 
02:34:11.030 --> 02:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
passed i think a lot of
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
employers said well now that the
 
02:34:14.469 --> 02:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
pregnancy discrimination act exists
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to lead to pregnant you know
 
02:34:18.550 --> 02:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
to employers being scared to hire
 
02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
pregnant women because we're nervous
 
02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
about discrimination
 
02:34:23.110 --> 02:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
and that certainly did not come to bear
 
02:34:25.110 --> 02:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
women have are in the workforce in
 
02:34:28.469 --> 02:34:28.479 align:start position:0%
record numbers today and the same
 
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
continues and
 
02:34:31.429 --> 02:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
by providing accommodations i think
 
02:34:33.429 --> 02:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to see a more harmonious
 
02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
workplace where pregnant women can stay
 
02:34:37.590 --> 02:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
attached to the workforce while they're
 
02:34:38.790 --> 02:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
pregnant and
 
02:34:40.790 --> 02:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
continue to contribute to their
 
02:34:40.800 --> 02:34:41.830 align:start position:0%
continue to contribute to their
workplaces

02:34:41.830 --> 02:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
workplaces
 
02:34:44.469 --> 02:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
so i just think it's it's a question we
 
02:34:45.990 --> 02:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
hear but it's not a question that comes
 
02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
to bear
 
02:34:50.070 --> 02:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
um just a quick comment on that i would
 
02:34:51.830 --> 02:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
suggest that all of you
 
02:34:54.790 --> 02:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh representatives got this uh email
 
02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:55.270 align:start position:0%
uh representatives got this uh email
from

02:34:55.270 --> 02:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:34:58.870 --> 02:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
elliot uh axelman uh i find it a very
 
02:35:02.710 --> 02:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh discouraging comment from him
 
02:35:05.670 --> 02:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh please take a read thank you and i
 
02:35:07.830 --> 02:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
think it shows why this law is needed
 
02:35:07.840 --> 02:35:08.469 align:start position:0%
think it shows why this law is needed
because

02:35:08.469 --> 02:35:08.479 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
there you know a lot of employers are
 
02:35:12.550 --> 02:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
incredibly wonderful
 
02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
and i know a lot of members might be
 
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
employers themselves and a lot of
 
02:35:17.670 --> 02:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
employers are already doing this
 
02:35:21.270 --> 02:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
but for some this clarity and the law
 
02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:21.750 align:start position:0%
but for some this clarity and the law
about

02:35:21.750 --> 02:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
what we as a society believe is
 
02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
important and from a legal standpoint
 
02:35:28.150 --> 02:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
is important for those you know few
 
02:35:29.349 --> 02:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
employers that
 
02:35:33.510 --> 02:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:36.950 --> 02:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay so i see that mr axelman has raised
 
02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
his hand he did not actually sign up to
 
02:35:43.349 --> 02:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
speak i was going to represent have my
 
02:35:46.389 --> 02:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
mountain malachi to finish up and we
 
02:35:48.790 --> 02:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
are extremely late so we're cutting into
 
02:35:50.070 --> 02:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
our lunch hour
 
02:35:52.870 --> 02:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
so all i can do is i being respectful i
 
02:35:55.110 --> 02:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
will let people testify mr axeman but
 
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
you better be brief because i might just
 
02:35:59.830 --> 02:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
cut you right off
 
02:36:02.950 --> 02:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
so i will promote you and
 
02:36:05.030 --> 02:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
miss malachi i will allow you to wrap it
 
02:36:07.270 --> 02:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
up but i hope you can also be brief when
 
02:36:09.349 --> 02:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
we do this because we
 
02:36:10.870 --> 02:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise we could just keep doing this
 
02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:12.790 align:start position:0%
otherwise we could just keep doing this
and

02:36:12.790 --> 02:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:16.389 --> 02:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
so go ahead mr ag uh oh no i didn't it
 
02:36:16.399 --> 02:36:17.110 align:start position:0%
so go ahead mr ag uh oh no i didn't it
didn't

02:36:17.110 --> 02:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
02:36:21.110 --> 02:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:23.349 --> 02:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh yeah there you go just you have to
 
02:36:25.670 --> 02:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
unmute yourself
 
02:36:27.030 --> 02:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
all right sorry it looks like it kicked
 
02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
me out a minute ago can you hear me now
 
02:36:31.110 --> 02:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
yes all right sorry all right uh sorry
 
02:36:32.309 --> 02:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
for not signing up i signed up for
 
02:36:33.030 --> 02:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
02:36:34.710 --> 02:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
69 but it looks like this one was
 
02:36:35.910 --> 02:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
running late so i'm here too but there's
 
02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
similar bills i can testify once for
 
02:36:37.680 --> 02:36:38.309 align:start position:0%
similar bills i can testify once for
both

02:36:38.309 --> 02:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
both
 
02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
as i said in the email these bills make
 
02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:41.990 align:start position:0%
as i said in the email these bills make
women

02:36:41.990 --> 02:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
women
 
02:36:44.550 --> 02:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
less employable i know that one of the
 
02:36:45.990 --> 02:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
representatives read my email and said
 
02:36:47.830 --> 02:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
that i sound bigoted i'm sorry
 
02:36:49.590 --> 02:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
um i don't hate women i love women i'm
 
02:36:51.110 --> 02:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
married to one i have three sisters a
 
02:36:52.389 --> 02:36:52.399 align:start position:0%
mother and plenty of other
 
02:36:54.309 --> 02:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
female relatives i want the best for
 
02:36:55.429 --> 02:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
women my
 
02:36:57.349 --> 02:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
wife is hopefully soon to be pregnant
 
02:36:58.550 --> 02:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
and she is employed
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
this bill would make her a less
 
02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
attractive employee
 
02:37:02.950 --> 02:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
it would make her from an asset into a
 
02:37:05.190 --> 02:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
liability which makes her less likely to
 
02:37:07.030 --> 02:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
be employed and remain employed
 
02:37:08.790 --> 02:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
the basic rules of economics cannot be
 
02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
manipulated if a woman costs more
 
02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
to employ they are less likely to be
 
02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:14.790 align:start position:0%
to employ they are less likely to be
employed

02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
employed
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
as i said in in my email in the
 
02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:18.070 align:start position:0%
as i said in in my email in the
testimony

02:37:18.070 --> 02:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:37:19.990 --> 02:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
if it costs me twice as much to employ a
 
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
woman i'm going to hire
 
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
a male for that same job is that illegal
 
02:37:25.990 --> 02:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
yes someone mentioned that's probably
 
02:37:27.910 --> 02:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
illegal throw me in jail so be it
 
02:37:29.590 --> 02:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
you can't manipulate the market and the
 
02:37:32.230 --> 02:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
basic rules of the world
 
02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
if you make women have accommodations go
 
02:37:35.670 --> 02:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
with them
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
or if you made males have accommodations
 
02:37:38.950 --> 02:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
if there were a bill that
 
02:37:42.150 --> 02:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
max proposed that made it a law for you
 
02:37:43.190 --> 02:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
to supply
 
02:37:45.590 --> 02:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
beautiful 25 year old masseuses every
 
02:37:47.349 --> 02:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
three hours for every male employee
 
02:37:48.950 --> 02:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
that would make male employees more
 
02:37:50.309 --> 02:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
expensive to employ you would make them
 
02:37:50.319 --> 02:37:51.349 align:start position:0%
expensive to employ you would make them
liabilities

02:37:51.349 --> 02:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
liabilities
 
02:37:52.630 --> 02:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
that would not get jobs and it would be
 
02:37:54.309 --> 02:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
a bad bill and i would oppose it it's
 
02:37:55.990 --> 02:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
not about sexism or feminism
 
02:37:57.910 --> 02:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
i think it's very inappropriate to make
 
02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
it about feminism or sexism
 
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
this is the opposite this bill makes
 
02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:03.110 align:start position:0%
this is the opposite this bill makes
women

02:38:03.110 --> 02:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
women
 
02:38:05.349 --> 02:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
harder to employ and and that's my big
 
02:38:06.870 --> 02:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
point i'll be briefing on there thank
 
02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:09.110 align:start position:0%
point i'll be briefing on there thank
you

02:38:09.110 --> 02:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:10.710 --> 02:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
great uh does this mean you won't have
 
02:38:14.070 --> 02:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
to testify on the next bill
 
02:38:15.670 --> 02:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
no they're similar enough that i think
 
02:38:18.070 --> 02:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
that this same uh reasoning applies to
 
02:38:18.710 --> 02:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
both thank you
 
02:38:20.550 --> 02:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
okay so yes you you don't have to
 
02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
testify great thank you
 
02:38:25.349 --> 02:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh all right um all right
 
02:38:27.590 --> 02:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
miss malachi why don't you wrap it up
 
02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
for us please
 
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:35.830 --> 02:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
i mean i i okay is it really that
 
02:38:37.510 --> 02:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
vitally this question is really gonna
 
02:38:39.030 --> 02:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
be earth-shattering and everybody's
 
02:38:41.190 --> 02:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
gonna have a whole new insight here
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
yes okay go ahead good question
 
02:38:48.950 --> 02:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
what's that this is a really brilliant
 
02:38:50.150 --> 02:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
creative question
 
02:38:53.750 --> 02:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
how much if this bill passes
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
as written and you hire a woman of child
 
02:38:58.710 --> 02:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
bearing age
 
02:39:01.349 --> 02:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
what is the maximum amount that you may
 
02:39:02.469 --> 02:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
have to spend
 
02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
to make those accommodations based on
 
02:39:06.469 --> 02:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
the wording that's there
 
02:39:09.030 --> 02:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
the way i've understand this bill is is
 
02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:09.590 align:start position:0%
the way i've understand this bill is is
that

02:39:09.590 --> 02:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:39:12.469 --> 02:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
what they're most concerned is process
 
02:39:14.469 --> 02:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
it's not about the dollar amount of it
 
02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's about the process
 
02:39:18.790 --> 02:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
did the company spend the time trying
 
02:39:19.590 --> 02:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
their best
 
02:39:23.110 --> 02:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
to accommodate the the pregnant woman
 
02:39:25.510 --> 02:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
if they did if they did everything
 
02:39:27.270 --> 02:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
possible to accommodate and they have
 
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
convinced the commission
 
02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
that they did a good job of process and
 
02:39:33.510 --> 02:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
that they really did everything possible
 
02:39:35.270 --> 02:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
to bend over backwards to try to find a
 
02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:36.150 align:start position:0%
to bend over backwards to try to find a
solution

02:39:36.150 --> 02:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
solution
 
02:39:37.750 --> 02:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
and but at the end of the day they say
 
02:39:39.190 --> 02:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
this is just not going to work
 
02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
that the commission will not cost them
 
02:39:43.030 --> 02:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know will not charge them they will
 
02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
not have to pay
 
02:39:47.349 --> 02:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
a dime as long as they did
 
02:39:49.349 --> 02:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
their process as long as they convinced
 
02:39:50.710 --> 02:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
the commission that they
 
02:39:53.270 --> 02:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
did everything in their power to try to
 
02:39:57.750 --> 02:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right so miss malachi
 
02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
did i wrap it up for you did i say
 
02:40:05.030 --> 02:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
everything you need to say or would you
 
02:40:06.710 --> 02:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
like to switch it anymore
 
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
what you all said uh just two two very
 
02:40:10.309 --> 02:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
quick points um
 
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
to to wrap it up and um thank you very
 
02:40:15.269 --> 02:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
much for allowing me to do that um i
 
02:40:16.790 --> 02:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate the testimony that's been
 
02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:17.670 align:start position:0%
appreciate the testimony that's been
given

02:40:17.670 --> 02:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
given
 
02:40:20.950 --> 02:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh all of it um and
 
02:40:25.269 --> 02:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh to um to several points that were
 
02:40:28.309 --> 02:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
were made uh previously um
 
02:40:30.630 --> 02:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
and i think actually attorney brachman
 
02:40:32.550 --> 02:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
may have covered this but just to
 
02:40:35.750 --> 02:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
put a finer point on it several of the
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
definitions i think
 
02:40:38.230 --> 02:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
people were questioning reasonable
 
02:40:38.240 --> 02:40:40.070 align:start position:0%
people were questioning reasonable
accommodation

02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
02:40:43.510 --> 02:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
as well as undue hardship and those
 
02:40:46.230 --> 02:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
elements are defined currently in our
 
02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
statute which is what we would use so
 
02:40:52.150 --> 02:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
even though this particular bill is is
 
02:40:55.510 --> 02:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
specific to pregnancy
 
02:40:58.630 --> 02:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
um in in one area of our statute
 
02:41:01.670 --> 02:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
the definitions are clearly stated
 
02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
and those are the things that we're
 
02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
using so we also use precedent
 
02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
um to to make decisions and um
 
02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
and we use so with how we
 
02:41:14.389 --> 02:41:14.399 align:start position:0%
operate um certainly we are the
 
02:41:16.150 --> 02:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency
 
02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
but when we have a question on
 
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
redefining something or a different
 
02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
entire a possible
 
02:41:25.990 --> 02:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
additional interpretation of something
 
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
we go to the ag's office
 
02:41:29.429 --> 02:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
and that's the arbiter of our state
 
02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
statutes period
 
02:41:33.830 --> 02:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
end of story and so we have a
 
02:41:36.070 --> 02:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
very familial relationship with the ag's
 
02:41:38.630 --> 02:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
office and we use our
 
02:41:41.590 --> 02:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
the attorney that is provided for us all
 
02:41:42.150 --> 02:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
the time
 
02:41:44.630 --> 02:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
in so much as we have monthly meetings
 
02:41:45.830 --> 02:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
02:41:48.790 --> 02:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
that we are doing our best to interpret
 
02:41:49.990 --> 02:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
interpret the law
 
02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh in the broadest sense to allow
 
02:41:57.190 --> 02:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
individuals who may have a charge to be
 
02:41:58.950 --> 02:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
able to bring a charge
 
02:42:02.150 --> 02:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
of uh discrimination so that we don't
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
leave anyone out so that no one's rights
 
02:42:05.510 --> 02:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
are violated or
 
02:42:08.550 --> 02:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
or hampered um i
 
02:42:10.790 --> 02:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
i think there's a bit of confusion and i
 
02:42:11.670 --> 02:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate what
 
02:42:14.070 --> 02:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
attorney brachman has stated and we have
 
02:42:16.870 --> 02:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:20.070 --> 02:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
the the groups that that
 
02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
a better balance have met with although
 
02:42:24.389 --> 02:42:24.399 align:start position:0%
they're in new hampshire
 
02:42:26.950 --> 02:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
their national organizations the new
 
02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:28.870 align:start position:0%
their national organizations the new
hampshire

02:42:28.870 --> 02:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
grassroots organization that has been
 
02:42:32.070 --> 02:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with this issue
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
for decades since 1997 is the new
 
02:42:37.110 --> 02:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire breastfeeding task force they
 
02:42:38.469 --> 02:42:38.479 align:start position:0%
were not included in
 
02:42:40.150 --> 02:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
in some of those meetings and the
 
02:42:42.469 --> 02:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
commission has met with them on other
 
02:42:42.479 --> 02:42:43.429 align:start position:0%
commission has met with them on other
occasions

02:42:43.429 --> 02:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
occasions
 
02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
and uh to an earlier point um i i
 
02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
regarding an amendment i don't think any
 
02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
additional amendments are necessary
 
02:42:53.670 --> 02:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
um for a variety of reasons which i
 
02:42:56.150 --> 02:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
won't go into but one of which was
 
02:42:59.349 --> 02:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
relative to um a council
 
02:43:02.469 --> 02:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
or a um a group
 
02:43:05.670 --> 02:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
that could or an advisory council that
 
02:43:05.680 --> 02:43:06.070 align:start position:0%
that could or an advisory council that
could

02:43:06.070 --> 02:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:43:08.389 --> 02:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
contemplate these issues on a consistent
 
02:43:08.399 --> 02:43:09.349 align:start position:0%
contemplate these issues on a consistent
basis

02:43:09.349 --> 02:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
basis
 
02:43:12.550 --> 02:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
um that has already been done it was um
 
02:43:16.389 --> 02:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
there were two different uh bills sb 488
 
02:43:18.150 --> 02:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
which was in 2016
 
02:43:22.230 --> 02:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
and sb 478 which was in 2018 and
 
02:43:25.110 --> 02:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
both of those bills dealt with creating
 
02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:25.349 align:start position:0%
both of those bills dealt with creating
an

02:43:25.349 --> 02:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:43:27.670 --> 02:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
advisory council which ms fredricks was
 
02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
a member of
 
02:43:32.950 --> 02:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
and participated in uh in some degree
 
02:43:35.269 --> 02:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
with some of the in terms of the
 
02:43:37.269 --> 02:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
meetings and there was a wide variety
 
02:43:40.469 --> 02:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
of stakeholders there were mothers state
 
02:43:40.479 --> 02:43:41.269 align:start position:0%
of stakeholders there were mothers state
agencies

02:43:41.269 --> 02:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
02:43:44.230 --> 02:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
someone an attorney representing
 
02:43:46.150 --> 02:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
appointed by the commission
 
02:43:49.269 --> 02:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
you had people from dhhs you had people
 
02:43:49.990 --> 02:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
from the business
 
02:43:51.750 --> 02:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
community so there was a wide variety of
 
02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:53.030 align:start position:0%
community so there was a wide variety of
stakeholders

02:43:53.030 --> 02:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
02:43:56.710 --> 02:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
and from that that council
 
02:43:59.990 --> 02:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
actually sb69 which we'll eventually get
 
02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:00.710 align:start position:0%
actually sb69 which we'll eventually get
to

02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:44:05.110 --> 02:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
was created um and so there's wide
 
02:44:08.550 --> 02:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
um there there's wide uh
 
02:44:11.429 --> 02:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
uh con uh i can't think of the word now
 
02:44:11.439 --> 02:44:11.910 align:start position:0%
uh con uh i can't think of the word now
but

02:44:11.910 --> 02:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:44:14.790 --> 02:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh um a lot of people pull together to
 
02:44:14.800 --> 02:44:15.190 align:start position:0%
uh um a lot of people pull together to
to

02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:44:19.269 --> 02:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
pull to to come up with the um
 
02:44:22.790 --> 02:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
the bill that the further the sp 69 that
 
02:44:23.910 --> 02:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to discuss
 
02:44:25.510 --> 02:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
i apologize a little flustered at the
 
02:44:28.150 --> 02:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
moment um
 
02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
part of the confusion is that in new
 
02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:31.349 align:start position:0%
part of the confusion is that in new
york

02:44:31.349 --> 02:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
york
 
02:44:34.469 --> 02:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
and quite a few other states you may as
 
02:44:36.630 --> 02:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
a person who's been discriminated
 
02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:37.590 align:start position:0%
a person who's been discriminated
against

02:44:37.590 --> 02:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
against
 
02:44:41.349 --> 02:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
you may go to court first
 
02:44:44.150 --> 02:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
and or you might go to a commission like
 
02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:44.550 align:start position:0%
and or you might go to a commission like
ours

02:44:44.550 --> 02:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
ours
 
02:44:47.990 --> 02:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
like ours in new hampshire you come to
 
02:44:51.190 --> 02:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
us first you do not go to court first
 
02:44:55.190 --> 02:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
so we are able to interpret
 
02:44:58.070 --> 02:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
and give deference to people who are
 
02:44:58.080 --> 02:44:59.030 align:start position:0%
and give deference to people who are
filing

02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
filing
 
02:45:01.269 --> 02:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
a charge of discrimination for
 
02:45:03.269 --> 02:45:03.279 align:start position:0%
themselves even if they're represented
 
02:45:06.710 --> 02:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
but we really work to make sure that
 
02:45:08.469 --> 02:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
someone who's not represented has a full
 
02:45:09.429 --> 02:45:09.439 align:start position:0%
understanding of
 
02:45:11.990 --> 02:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
of what remedies are available to them
 
02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:12.950 align:start position:0%
of what remedies are available to them
so

02:45:12.950 --> 02:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:45:15.510 --> 02:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
using a court interpretation although
 
02:45:17.670 --> 02:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
could be relevant at some point
 
02:45:20.630 --> 02:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
if a person is been if the person who
 
02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
files the charge
 
02:45:24.309 --> 02:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
gets prop if there's probable cause
 
02:45:25.429 --> 02:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
that's found
 
02:45:27.910 --> 02:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
then that individual can then remove it
 
02:45:28.790 --> 02:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
from us
 
02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
and take it to court or they can remain
 
02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
with us and go through a hearing
 
02:45:34.790 --> 02:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
after probable cause is found just like
 
02:45:37.030 --> 02:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
if the business wants to remove it to
 
02:45:39.190 --> 02:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
court and try it there
 
02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
but it's important to note that although
 
02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:42.230 align:start position:0%
but it's important to note that although
court

02:45:42.230 --> 02:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
decisions are relevant they do not have
 
02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:46.630 align:start position:0%
decisions are relevant they do not have
bearing

02:45:46.630 --> 02:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
bearing
 
02:45:49.590 --> 02:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
as to how the commission would follow a
 
02:45:51.190 --> 02:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
charge through
 
02:45:54.070 --> 02:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
so you have to based on state tax
 
02:45:54.080 --> 02:45:55.030 align:start position:0%
so you have to based on state tax
statute

02:45:55.030 --> 02:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:45:57.670 --> 02:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
file a charge of discrimination with us
 
02:45:57.680 --> 02:45:58.550 align:start position:0%
file a charge of discrimination with us
first

02:45:58.550 --> 02:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
and um and it's good to know from
 
02:46:01.910 --> 02:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
attorney brachman that there
 
02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
have been some calls that were made to
 
02:46:05.190 --> 02:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
them i would
 
02:46:07.990 --> 02:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate if those uh
 
02:46:09.510 --> 02:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
individuals and i would love to work
 
02:46:09.990 --> 02:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
even more
 
02:46:11.910 --> 02:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
closely with the better balance if those
 
02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
individuals had been referred to the
 
02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:14.469 align:start position:0%
individuals had been referred to the
commission

02:46:14.469 --> 02:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:46:16.150 --> 02:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
we might have either been able to file a
 
02:46:17.670 --> 02:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
charge on their behalf
 
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
or to intervene to assist those
 
02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:21.670 align:start position:0%
or to intervene to assist those
individuals

02:46:21.670 --> 02:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:46:25.110 --> 02:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
because of how state law is stated
 
02:46:27.830 --> 02:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
a better balance they can maybe talk to
 
02:46:29.510 --> 02:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
the employer but they cannot file a
 
02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:30.150 align:start position:0%
the employer but they cannot file a
charge

02:46:30.150 --> 02:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
charge
 
02:46:32.230 --> 02:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
on that individual's behalf they have to
 
02:46:33.349 --> 02:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
come to us first
 
02:46:35.030 --> 02:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
so it would be i think even more
 
02:46:37.269 --> 02:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
productive if we were more collaborative
 
02:46:39.990 --> 02:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
on that and and we could assist those
 
02:46:41.349 --> 02:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
those new hampshire
 
02:46:44.790 --> 02:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
individuals in their concerns or issues
 
02:46:47.110 --> 02:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
that they might be having so without us
 
02:46:48.150 --> 02:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
knowing about them
 
02:46:52.150 --> 02:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that we can do um and so
 
02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
i would leave it there and hope that we
 
02:46:55.670 --> 02:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
can conclude testimony on
 
02:46:59.510 --> 02:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
sb69 and then move on exceeding on sb68
 
02:47:03.670 --> 02:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
and then move on to sb69 okay so so i'm
 
02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:04.230 align:start position:0%
and then move on to sb69 okay so so i'm
sorry

02:47:04.230 --> 02:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:47:08.070 --> 02:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:09.590 --> 02:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
we can't have this going back and forth
 
02:47:12.389 --> 02:47:12.399 align:start position:0%
okay so uh and i did promise her that
 
02:47:13.910 --> 02:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
i'd give her the last word i
 
02:47:16.230 --> 02:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
you know so i i screwed up but at this
 
02:47:18.070 --> 02:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
point let's let's just get on to the

nursing mother

i'm proud to appear before you today to
 
02:48:14.830 --> 02:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
introduce senate bill
 
02:48:17.510 --> 02:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
69. many working families know
 
02:48:20.469 --> 02:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
that working and having a family has
 
02:48:21.030 --> 02:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
never been
 
02:48:24.550 --> 02:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
so difficult stagnant incomes and
 
02:48:27.429 --> 02:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
outdated workplace practices continue to
 
02:48:28.950 --> 02:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
pit being apparent
 
02:48:31.990 --> 02:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
against having a career furthermore
 
02:48:33.269 --> 02:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
the global pandemic has
 
02:48:35.190 --> 02:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impacted
 
02:48:37.269 --> 02:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
working mothers and women of color in
 
02:48:39.750 --> 02:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire across the country as well
 
02:48:41.190 --> 02:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
and we've seen women leaving the
 
02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
workforce during the last year because
 
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
they simply cannot meet all the demands
 
02:48:46.230 --> 02:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
placed on them
 
02:48:48.070 --> 02:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
we need to do more to support working
 
02:48:50.550 --> 02:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
mothers senate bill 69
 
02:48:53.830 --> 02:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
does this by requiring certain employers
 
02:48:57.269 --> 02:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
in a flexible manner to provide access
 
02:48:59.910 --> 02:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
to a sufficient space and a reasonable
 
02:49:00.710 --> 02:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
break period
 
02:49:02.710 --> 02:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
for nursing mothers to express milk
 
02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
during working hours
 
02:49:07.750 --> 02:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
this bill builds on years of work by
 
02:49:09.830 --> 02:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
senator martha fuller clark
 
02:49:12.630 --> 02:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
and an incredibly strong and responsive
 
02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:13.510 align:start position:0%
and an incredibly strong and responsive
coalition

02:49:13.510 --> 02:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
coalition
 
02:49:14.630 --> 02:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned before of
 
02:49:17.030 --> 02:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who work together to come
 
02:49:17.670 --> 02:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
up with
 
02:49:19.910 --> 02:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire solution to support
 
02:49:21.910 --> 02:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
women in the workplace
 
02:49:24.710 --> 02:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's the bill that you will hear today
 
02:49:26.070 --> 02:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
so specifically this
 
02:49:29.269 --> 02:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
bill fills the coverage gap for working
 
02:49:29.279 --> 02:49:29.750 align:start position:0%
bill fills the coverage gap for working
women

02:49:29.750 --> 02:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
women
 
02:49:32.710 --> 02:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
who were and continue to be excluded
 
02:49:34.150 --> 02:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
from the 2010
 
02:49:36.150 --> 02:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
federal law break time for nursing
 
02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:37.190 align:start position:0%
federal law break time for nursing
mothers

02:49:37.190 --> 02:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
mothers
 
02:49:39.190 --> 02:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
this federal law was an incredibly
 
02:49:41.269 --> 02:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
important first step
 
02:49:44.389 --> 02:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
but nearly one and four women of child
 
02:49:45.990 --> 02:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
bearing age are not covered by the
 
02:49:48.150 --> 02:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
02:49:50.630 --> 02:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
32 states have already passed
 
02:49:52.710 --> 02:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
legislation to bridge the gap in the
 
02:49:53.590 --> 02:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
02:49:55.910 --> 02:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
to cover more nursing mothers and
 
02:49:55.920 --> 02:49:56.630 align:start position:0%
to cover more nursing mothers and
provide

02:49:56.630 --> 02:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:49:58.950 --> 02:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
expanded protections and now it's new
 
02:50:00.630 --> 02:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire's turn
 
02:50:03.190 --> 02:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is a win-win solution for the
 
02:50:06.150 --> 02:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
granite state because it benefits babies
 
02:50:08.950 --> 02:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
working mothers businesses and our
 
02:50:08.960 --> 02:50:10.790 align:start position:0%
working mothers businesses and our
economy

02:50:10.790 --> 02:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
economy
 
02:50:12.950 --> 02:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
while the health benefits are well of
 
02:50:14.630 --> 02:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
nursing are well known and there are
 
02:50:16.309 --> 02:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
others to testify to those health
 
02:50:16.319 --> 02:50:17.590 align:start position:0%
others to testify to those health
benefits

02:50:17.590 --> 02:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
02:50:20.230 --> 02:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
returning to work and we know that
 
02:50:22.230 --> 02:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
returning to work and a lack of lack of
 
02:50:23.830 --> 02:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
employer accommodations
 
02:50:27.030 --> 02:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
are frequent reasons for women to stop
 
02:50:30.389 --> 02:50:30.399 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding before a child turns one
 
02:50:32.630 --> 02:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
workplace lactation programs like the
 
02:50:34.469 --> 02:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
ones contained in this bill
 
02:50:35.830 --> 02:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
have been shown to increase
 
02:50:37.830 --> 02:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding among working mothers who
 
02:50:39.190 --> 02:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
are planning to breastfeed
 
02:50:41.830 --> 02:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
which again benefits both the mother and
 
02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
the baby
 
02:50:45.030 --> 02:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding protects babies and
 
02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
children from a host of acute
 
02:50:49.269 --> 02:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
chronic diseases that has been shown to
 
02:50:51.110 --> 02:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
lower health care costs for mothers and
 
02:50:51.910 --> 02:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
their infants
 
02:50:53.349 --> 02:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
when compared to non-breastfeeding
 
02:50:56.150 --> 02:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
mothers but not only that
 
02:50:58.790 --> 02:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
it also provides a real opportunity for
 
02:51:00.150 --> 02:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
employers to build
 
02:51:03.510 --> 02:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
loyalty trust and productivity with
 
02:51:05.030 --> 02:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
their employers
 
02:51:07.269 --> 02:51:07.279 align:start position:0%
employees by enabling them to provide
 
02:51:10.150 --> 02:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
something so important to their child
 
02:51:11.910 --> 02:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is an important initiative to
 
02:51:14.150 --> 02:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
keep working mothers in the workforce
 
02:51:17.510 --> 02:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
as we rebuild our economy this is
 
02:51:19.110 --> 02:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
increasingly important as new hampshire
 
02:51:21.030 --> 02:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
continues to experience a workforce
 
02:51:21.040 --> 02:51:22.150 align:start position:0%
continues to experience a workforce
shortage

02:51:22.150 --> 02:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
02:51:24.710 --> 02:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
and women are a large and important
 
02:51:24.720 --> 02:51:25.269 align:start position:0%
and women are a large and important
sector

02:51:25.269 --> 02:51:25.279 align:start position:0%
sector
 
02:51:27.990 --> 02:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire's labor force women
 
02:51:28.950 --> 02:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
make up almost
 
02:51:32.389 --> 02:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
64 of our civilian workforce
 
02:51:34.710 --> 02:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
and comprise two-thirds of the essential
 
02:51:37.269 --> 02:51:37.279 align:start position:0%
workforce during the pandemic
 
02:51:38.710 --> 02:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
supporting nursing mothers in the
 
02:51:40.950 --> 02:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
workforce the workplace can also benefit
 
02:51:40.960 --> 02:51:41.590 align:start position:0%
workforce the workplace can also benefit
companies

02:51:41.590 --> 02:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
companies
 
02:51:44.070 --> 02:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
and is part of building a modern
 
02:51:45.990 --> 02:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
forward-thinking economy
 
02:51:47.910 --> 02:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
you will hear from many businesses today
 
02:51:49.990 --> 02:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:51:53.030 --> 02:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
point so i wanted to point out why this
 
02:51:55.190 --> 02:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
is a very reasonable bill with a
 
02:51:57.510 --> 02:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
uniquely new hampshire solution
 
02:51:59.590 --> 02:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
and just highlight some points from the
 
02:52:02.070 --> 02:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
broad coalition that worked on this bill
 
02:52:05.190 --> 02:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
so this bill isn't about mandating
 
02:52:06.790 --> 02:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
certain things it's about creating
 
02:52:10.150 --> 02:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
access not mandating space the coalition
 
02:52:12.150 --> 02:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
that worked on this bill was responsive
 
02:52:14.469 --> 02:52:14.479 align:start position:0%
to the needs of new hampshire small
 
02:52:15.830 --> 02:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
businesses and listened
 
02:52:18.550 --> 02:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
to them when they expressed concerns
 
02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:18.950 align:start position:0%
to them when they expressed concerns
about

02:52:18.950 --> 02:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:52:22.070 --> 02:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh text in the bill which is why you'll
 
02:52:22.080 --> 02:52:22.710 align:start position:0%
uh text in the bill which is why you'll
see

02:52:22.710 --> 02:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:52:25.429 --> 02:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
the added definition of undue hardship
 
02:52:27.110 --> 02:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
we defined unto hardship
 
02:52:29.110 --> 02:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
and that was at their request and you'll
 
02:52:30.469 --> 02:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
see that connection of
 
02:52:33.110 --> 02:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
the definition of undue hardship with
 
02:52:33.120 --> 02:52:33.590 align:start position:0%
the definition of undue hardship with
the

02:52:33.590 --> 02:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:52:35.349 --> 02:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
ability for businesses to request a
 
02:52:38.309 --> 02:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
hardship exemption
 
02:52:40.389 --> 02:52:40.399 align:start position:0%
we also thought it was very important to
 
02:52:42.150 --> 02:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
respond to businesses
 
02:52:44.469 --> 02:52:44.479 align:start position:0%
by defining what a reasonable break
 
02:52:44.479 --> 02:52:45.269 align:start position:0%
by defining what a reasonable break
period

02:52:45.269 --> 02:52:45.279 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:52:47.830 --> 02:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
is so you'll see that we have defined
 
02:52:49.590 --> 02:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
what a reasonable break period is that
 
02:52:50.950 --> 02:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
was in response
 
02:52:53.190 --> 02:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
to businesses that wanted some more
 
02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:54.230 align:start position:0%
to businesses that wanted some more
clarity

02:52:54.230 --> 02:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
02:52:56.630 --> 02:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
and you will also note that the
 
02:52:56.640 --> 02:52:57.830 align:start position:0%
and you will also note that the
definition

02:52:57.830 --> 02:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
definition
 
02:52:59.670 --> 02:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
and you'll hear some more testimony from
 
02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:01.349 align:start position:0%
and you'll hear some more testimony from
doctors

02:53:01.349 --> 02:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
02:53:03.830 --> 02:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
is consistent with the biological needs
 
02:53:05.030 --> 02:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
of a nursing woman
 
02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
so if you haven't nursed before you may
 
02:53:08.309 --> 02:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
not know
 
02:53:12.070 --> 02:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
that nursing is uh by lactation and
 
02:53:14.230 --> 02:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
nursing is a biological function
 
02:53:16.070 --> 02:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's a give and take with mothers and
 
02:53:17.670 --> 02:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
babies and so this
 
02:53:20.150 --> 02:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh time period in um in the definition
 
02:53:22.309 --> 02:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
is consistent with the biological needs
 
02:53:24.150 --> 02:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
of mom and baby and again you'll hear
 
02:53:25.670 --> 02:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
more about that
 
02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
lastly i wanted to point out that other
 
02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:28.950 align:start position:0%
lastly i wanted to point out that other
state

02:53:28.950 --> 02:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:53:31.910 --> 02:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
with a similar law filling this coverage
 
02:53:31.920 --> 02:53:32.550 align:start position:0%
with a similar law filling this coverage
gap

02:53:32.550 --> 02:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
gap
 
02:53:35.750 --> 02:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
require all employers to comply but
 
02:53:38.150 --> 02:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
this bill applies only to employers with
 
02:53:40.070 --> 02:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
six or more employees
 
02:53:42.389 --> 02:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
and that was to be consistent and thus
 
02:53:44.309 --> 02:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
more predictable for businesses with new
 
02:53:45.510 --> 02:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire's existing
 
02:53:49.670 --> 02:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination statute rsa 354-a
 
02:53:51.590 --> 02:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
so i will stop there um there will be
 
02:53:53.030 --> 02:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
plenty of people behind me
 
02:53:55.110 --> 02:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to take any questions
 
02:53:58.469 --> 02:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:01.190 --> 02:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
have we have a question representative
 
02:54:01.200 --> 02:54:02.710 align:start position:0%
have we have a question representative
burroughs

02:54:02.710 --> 02:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
burroughs
 
02:54:05.030 --> 02:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
yes thanks for taking my question which
 
02:54:07.750 --> 02:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
is um
 
02:54:09.830 --> 02:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
on the on the clause about the hardship
 
02:54:12.230 --> 02:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
exemption who gets to determine
 
02:54:14.309 --> 02:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
what is what is actually a hardship
 
02:54:16.070 --> 02:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
exemption because it's not
 
02:54:18.309 --> 02:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
spelled out yeah thank you for that
 
02:54:20.070 --> 02:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
question representative burroughs and
 
02:54:21.830 --> 02:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
this came up also in the senate
 
02:54:23.830 --> 02:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
um we you'll hear testimony from the
 
02:54:25.269 --> 02:54:25.279 align:start position:0%
department of labor but
 
02:54:28.790 --> 02:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
be you'll see that this uh this bill
 
02:54:32.469 --> 02:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
puts the um puts the language within
 
02:54:35.349 --> 02:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
the department of labor statute so it's
 
02:54:37.269 --> 02:54:37.279 align:start position:0%
clear just based where
 
02:54:39.190 --> 02:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
this language will go that it's the
 
02:54:40.950 --> 02:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
department of labor that will be
 
02:54:43.349 --> 02:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
um interpreting it and granting those
 
02:54:44.870 --> 02:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
hardship exemptions
 
02:54:48.790 --> 02:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you okay well thank you
 
02:54:50.309 --> 02:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:54:53.349 --> 02:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh then we have another senator here
 
02:54:56.870 --> 02:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh and i've just promoted
 
02:55:00.830 --> 02:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:05.030 --> 02:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
good well still good morning
 
02:55:08.309 --> 02:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
we've barely made it we did
 
02:55:11.269 --> 02:55:11.279 align:start position:0%
yes good morning uh mr chairman and
 
02:55:12.790 --> 02:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
members of the house commerce committee
 
02:55:15.269 --> 02:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
it's very nice to see you again
 
02:55:17.870 --> 02:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
um i'm here to testify in support of
 
02:55:19.830 --> 02:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
sb69 and i will
 
02:55:21.990 --> 02:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
attempt to be brief as i know you've had
 
02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
a long warning
 
02:55:26.630 --> 02:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
um i'm thrilled to be here in support of
 
02:55:27.750 --> 02:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
this bill i think
 
02:55:29.910 --> 02:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
um you know this bill builds on the long
 
02:55:31.830 --> 02:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
legacy of senator martha fuller clark
 
02:55:32.469 --> 02:55:32.479 align:start position:0%
who i
 
02:55:35.670 --> 02:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
am trying to step into the very large
 
02:55:36.790 --> 02:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
shoes of um
 
02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
but has been the result of over four
 
02:55:41.830 --> 02:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
years of study by the lactation advisory
 
02:55:42.950 --> 02:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
council so
 
02:55:44.950 --> 02:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know this issue has been extensively
 
02:55:46.550 --> 02:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
studied and
 
02:55:48.550 --> 02:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
i think this legislation has emerged as
 
02:55:50.230 --> 02:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
a very matured and sophisticated
 
02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:51.590 align:start position:0%
a very matured and sophisticated
compromise

02:55:51.590 --> 02:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
02:55:53.990 --> 02:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a flexible bill and it
 
02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:54.710 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a flexible bill and it
allows

02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
allows
 
02:55:56.790 --> 02:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
accommodation by our businesses for this
 
02:55:57.990 --> 02:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
very natural process
 
02:56:00.389 --> 02:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
you know i think we all feel that small
 
02:56:01.910 --> 02:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
businesses in new hampshire are our
 
02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:02.630 align:start position:0%
businesses in new hampshire are our
lifeblood

02:56:02.630 --> 02:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
lifeblood
 
02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
they're our priority and it's certainly
 
02:56:06.630 --> 02:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
not the intent of this bill to
 
02:56:08.710 --> 02:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
to jeopardize that in any way my
 
02:56:10.230 --> 02:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
personal experience is that i worked at
 
02:56:11.349 --> 02:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
a company of six
 
02:56:13.190 --> 02:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
or i do work at a company of six people
 
02:56:15.110 --> 02:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
and they were able to accommodate
 
02:56:18.469 --> 02:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
um similarly to what this bill would ask
 
02:56:20.630 --> 02:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
um for me to nurse my daughter when i
 
02:56:22.710 --> 02:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
had her about a year and a half ago
 
02:56:24.630 --> 02:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
so i think you know senator whitley
 
02:56:26.230 --> 02:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
touched on part of this
 
02:56:28.230 --> 02:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
you know efforts like this support a
 
02:56:30.389 --> 02:56:30.399 align:start position:0%
more modern economy for new hampshire
 
02:56:32.309 --> 02:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
and if you talk to our businesses their
 
02:56:34.870 --> 02:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
biggest need is employees they have open
 
02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:35.990 align:start position:0%
biggest need is employees they have open
positions

02:56:35.990 --> 02:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
positions
 
02:56:39.110 --> 02:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
and especially now um pose pandemic you
 
02:56:40.710 --> 02:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
know with the housing
 
02:56:42.389 --> 02:56:42.399 align:start position:0%
market being what it is you know we need
 
02:56:44.630 --> 02:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
to do everything we can as a state
 
02:56:47.030 --> 02:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
to support continuing to modernize our
 
02:56:48.870 --> 02:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
economy and to attract talent into the
 
02:56:49.910 --> 02:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
state and so
 
02:56:51.670 --> 02:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
this is just one more tool that i think
 
02:56:54.389 --> 02:56:54.399 align:start position:0%
supports working families being able to
 
02:56:56.150 --> 02:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
have moms return to work
 
02:56:58.870 --> 02:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
and afford their housing it's such a
 
02:56:58.880 --> 02:56:59.429 align:start position:0%
and afford their housing it's such a
small

02:56:59.429 --> 02:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
small
 
02:57:01.590 --> 02:57:01.600 align:start position:0%
period in a woman's professional life
 
02:57:02.469 --> 02:57:02.479 align:start position:0%
over the
 
02:57:04.389 --> 02:57:04.399 align:start position:0%
over the overall contributions that
 
02:57:06.710 --> 02:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
she'll make to her employer and so
 
02:57:08.710 --> 02:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
i think that it it makes sense for us
 
02:57:10.389 --> 02:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
all to support this and i hope you can
 
02:57:10.399 --> 02:57:11.190 align:start position:0%
all to support this and i hope you can
support

02:57:11.190 --> 02:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:57:13.990 --> 02:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
a recommendation of that to pass over on
 
02:57:16.389 --> 02:57:16.399 align:start position:0%
the senate side we were able to see
 
02:57:18.710 --> 02:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
this bill pass unanimously out of center
 
02:57:20.389 --> 02:57:20.399 align:start position:0%
commerce and it also received a
 
02:57:22.389 --> 02:57:22.399 align:start position:0%
unanimous floor vote so
 
02:57:24.790 --> 02:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
we're hoping that house commerce will
 
02:57:26.230 --> 02:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
give it the same treatment
 
02:57:27.990 --> 02:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the opportunity to
 
02:57:29.429 --> 02:57:29.439 align:start position:0%
testify and happy to answer any
 
02:57:32.389 --> 02:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:36.630 --> 02:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh so uh representative abramson has a
 
02:57:36.640 --> 02:57:38.790 align:start position:0%
uh so uh representative abramson has a
question

02:57:38.790 --> 02:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:57:40.630 --> 02:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair thank you senator
 
02:57:42.150 --> 02:57:42.160 align:start position:0%

02:57:44.309 --> 02:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
um how would you accommodate this
 
02:57:44.319 --> 02:57:45.269 align:start position:0%
um how would you accommodate this
mandate

02:57:45.269 --> 02:57:45.279 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
02:57:48.830 --> 02:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh in uh for workers working in road
 
02:57:48.840 --> 02:57:50.309 align:start position:0%
uh in uh for workers working in road
construction

02:57:50.309 --> 02:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
construction
 
02:57:52.230 --> 02:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
workers working in what road
 
02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:53.830 align:start position:0%
workers working in what road
construction

02:57:53.830 --> 02:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
construction
 
02:57:57.110 --> 02:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
road construction yes so this this bill
 
02:57:57.120 --> 02:57:57.510 align:start position:0%
road construction yes so this this bill
does

02:57:57.510 --> 02:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:58:00.630 --> 02:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
ask um you know for an employer to kind
 
02:58:00.640 --> 02:58:01.269 align:start position:0%
ask um you know for an employer to kind
of

02:58:01.269 --> 02:58:01.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:58:04.230 --> 02:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
previously to a lot of the similar to a
 
02:58:05.429 --> 02:58:05.439 align:start position:0%
lot of testimony you heard on the
 
02:58:06.550 --> 02:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
previous bill
 
02:58:08.070 --> 02:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do here is have
 
02:58:09.750 --> 02:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
employers make reasonable accommodation
 
02:58:11.429 --> 02:58:11.439 align:start position:0%
so if for example
 
02:58:14.469 --> 02:58:14.479 align:start position:0%
a worker could you know
 
02:58:17.110 --> 02:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
return to a space that is private
 
02:58:19.750 --> 02:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere it could be on or off site
 
02:58:22.070 --> 02:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know have access to the equipment
 
02:58:23.910 --> 02:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
they need which is just a chair and an
 
02:58:23.920 --> 02:58:24.790 align:start position:0%
they need which is just a chair and an
outlet

02:58:24.790 --> 02:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
outlet
 
02:58:26.710 --> 02:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
in order to express milk and then return
 
02:58:28.630 --> 02:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
to the job then that would be
 
02:58:30.790 --> 02:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
all we were asking and and that can be
 
02:58:32.389 --> 02:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
accommodated in different ways between
 
02:58:34.970 --> 02:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
the employer and the employee
 
02:58:34.980 --> 02:58:36.790 align:start position:0%
the employer and the employee
[Music]

02:58:36.790 --> 02:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:58:38.630 --> 02:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
what surprise for the question you may
 
02:58:38.640 --> 02:58:40.309 align:start position:0%
what surprise for the question you may
inquire

02:58:40.309 --> 02:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
inquire
 
02:58:43.110 --> 02:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
what about transportation i'm thinking
 
02:58:43.120 --> 02:58:44.389 align:start position:0%
what about transportation i'm thinking
um

02:58:44.389 --> 02:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know whether it's trucking or
 
02:58:49.429 --> 02:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
you know boats or planes or what have
 
02:58:51.030 --> 02:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
you what about someone working in the
 
02:58:54.150 --> 02:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:56.389 --> 02:58:56.399 align:start position:0%
yes sir thanks for the question and and
 
02:58:58.630 --> 02:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
i would have a similar answer
 
02:59:00.790 --> 02:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
um which is that you know it's just
 
02:59:01.910 --> 02:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
something that the employer and the
 
02:59:04.070 --> 02:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
employee need to work out but
 
02:59:06.870 --> 02:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
i will point out that um you know we
 
02:59:09.269 --> 02:59:09.279 align:start position:0%
make accommodations for
 
02:59:11.349 --> 02:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
folks on the job for all different
 
02:59:13.590 --> 02:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
things and that's required by statute
 
02:59:16.150 --> 02:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
now you know the value of your employee
 
02:59:18.070 --> 02:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
over the long term is
 
02:59:20.550 --> 02:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
is something that needs to be considered
 
02:59:22.070 --> 02:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
by the employer when you're making these
 
02:59:23.190 --> 02:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
decisions and i think
 
02:59:26.309 --> 02:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that women give birth and
 
02:59:27.429 --> 02:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
that women
 
02:59:29.429 --> 02:59:29.439 align:start position:0%
need to nurse their children and that
 
02:59:31.990 --> 02:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
that bonding experience is good for
 
02:59:34.469 --> 02:59:34.479 align:start position:0%
babies and for mothers
 
02:59:36.070 --> 02:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
is one side of the coin and then i think
 
02:59:37.510 --> 02:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
the other side is that it really gives
 
02:59:39.510 --> 02:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
employers an opportunity to
 
02:59:41.269 --> 02:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
build their relationship with their
 
02:59:43.429 --> 02:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
employees i know in my case
 
02:59:45.269 --> 02:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
it only increased my loyalty and
 
02:59:47.110 --> 02:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
productivity with my employer because
 
02:59:48.870 --> 02:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
i felt that they had really accommodated
 
02:59:50.870 --> 02:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
that sort of unique period
 
02:59:54.150 --> 02:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
in my in my life so i think um again
 
02:59:55.110 --> 02:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
it's something
 
02:59:57.269 --> 02:59:57.279 align:start position:0%
you know that isn't built into our
 
02:59:58.790 --> 02:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
economy as it is but i think
 
03:00:01.190 --> 03:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
is something that we should all uh start
 
03:00:03.269 --> 03:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
to put the tools in place to accommodate
 
03:00:04.150 --> 03:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
as it is
 
03:00:05.910 --> 03:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
something that affects all of our
 
03:00:09.429 --> 03:00:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:11.910 --> 03:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
if i if i may i wanted to respond to
 
03:00:12.950 --> 03:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
that question too that
 
03:00:16.309 --> 03:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
may give some more okay thank you i
 
03:00:17.830 --> 03:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate that mr chair
 
03:00:19.910 --> 03:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to point out you know
 
03:00:21.110 --> 03:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
we are not asking
 
03:00:24.230 --> 03:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
folks and businesses to create you know
 
03:00:26.790 --> 03:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
to build new spaces this is about
 
03:00:27.910 --> 03:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
allowing for
 
03:00:29.830 --> 03:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
and creating access rather than
 
03:00:31.269 --> 03:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
mandating space
 
03:00:32.550 --> 03:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
the other point i think with the
 
03:00:33.990 --> 03:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
industries that you mentioned you
 
03:00:35.269 --> 03:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
rightly mentioned
 
03:00:38.070 --> 03:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh trucking construction those are our
 
03:00:39.830 --> 03:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
larger businesses that already
 
03:00:41.429 --> 03:00:41.439 align:start position:0%
uh are already under the current
 
03:00:43.030 --> 03:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
requirement under federal law
 
03:00:46.150 --> 03:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
companies of 50 employees uh or more
 
03:00:48.790 --> 03:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
already are already required to do this
 
03:00:48.800 --> 03:00:49.190 align:start position:0%
already are already required to do this
uh

03:00:49.190 --> 03:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:00:51.349 --> 03:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
by federal law so this is um just
 
03:00:52.950 --> 03:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
thinking through what works best for our
 
03:00:53.990 --> 03:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
small businesses
 
03:00:57.750 --> 03:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
03:01:00.950 --> 03:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh and then we have
 
03:01:03.510 --> 03:01:03.520 align:start position:0%

earlier this morning

the the clerk a copy of my written
testimony

03:02:39.830 --> 03:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:42.950 --> 03:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
this bill helps is pro business
 
03:02:46.070 --> 03:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
because it helps businesses recruit and
 
03:02:46.080 --> 03:02:46.710 align:start position:0%
because it helps businesses recruit and
retain

03:02:46.710 --> 03:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
retain
 
03:02:50.389 --> 03:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
quality employees quality employees
 
03:02:53.910 --> 03:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
in an important demographic it builds
 
03:02:57.269 --> 03:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
loyalty in employees who appreciate
 
03:02:57.279 --> 03:02:57.990 align:start position:0%
loyalty in employees who appreciate
their

03:02:57.990 --> 03:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:03:01.349 --> 03:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
employers reasonable accommodations
 
03:03:04.469 --> 03:03:04.479 align:start position:0%
and uh as was mentioned just
 
03:03:07.750 --> 03:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
prior um i think it can also
 
03:03:11.030 --> 03:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh increase uh an employee's
 
03:03:14.389 --> 03:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
productivity and attachment
 
03:03:16.790 --> 03:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
to the success of the business that's
 
03:03:16.800 --> 03:03:19.190 align:start position:0%
to the success of the business that's
important

03:03:19.190 --> 03:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:03:22.230 --> 03:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
it also reduces the time and the cost of
 
03:03:23.670 --> 03:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
employee turnover
 
03:03:26.389 --> 03:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
and i've run two businesses and i can
 
03:03:28.950 --> 03:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
tell you that that's one of the things
 
03:03:32.150 --> 03:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
that is always a problem for a business
 
03:03:35.349 --> 03:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
um because it helps retain employees
 
03:03:38.309 --> 03:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh and it doesn't put you in a situation
 
03:03:40.550 --> 03:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
where you need to find and train
 
03:03:45.230 --> 03:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
replacements i find this to be a
 
03:03:45.240 --> 03:03:48.389 align:start position:0%
replacements i find this to be a
win-win-win

03:03:48.389 --> 03:03:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:51.590 --> 03:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
as working mothers are able to stay with
 
03:03:51.600 --> 03:03:51.910 align:start position:0%
as working mothers are able to stay with
their

03:03:51.910 --> 03:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:03:55.030 --> 03:03:55.040 align:start position:0%

you here uh
 
03:08:25.750 --> 03:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:29.190 --> 03:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
and donna you just have to
 
03:08:33.269 --> 03:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:36.389 --> 03:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning afternoon oh
 
03:08:37.269 --> 03:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
03:08:39.590 --> 03:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
i started in the morning as did you this
 
03:08:41.110 --> 03:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
has been a long day for you guys i
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the opportunity to
 
03:08:44.469 --> 03:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
speak before you
 
03:08:46.389 --> 03:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh chairman hunt and the the other
 
03:08:48.150 --> 03:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
members of your committee
 
03:08:51.030 --> 03:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
um my name again donna gaudette hosmer
 
03:08:52.790 --> 03:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
i'm the mother of
 
03:08:55.590 --> 03:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
four teenagers all of whom were
 
03:08:55.600 --> 03:08:56.710 align:start position:0%
four teenagers all of whom were
breastfed

03:08:56.710 --> 03:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
breastfed
 
03:08:59.349 --> 03:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
i'm also a business owner in that until
 
03:09:00.950 --> 03:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
very recently
 
03:09:03.190 --> 03:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
my family and i had owned auto serve
 
03:09:05.429 --> 03:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
dealerships in tilton new hampshire
 
03:09:07.990 --> 03:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
we'd own that business for over 30 years
 
03:09:09.510 --> 03:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm also a partner
 
03:09:12.309 --> 03:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
in a growing manufacturing plant in
 
03:09:12.319 --> 03:09:13.750 align:start position:0%
in a growing manufacturing plant in
lancaster

03:09:13.750 --> 03:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
lancaster
 
03:09:15.429 --> 03:09:15.439 align:start position:0%
so between these two businesses we
 
03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
employed well over 300
 
03:09:21.670 --> 03:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
people i'm speaking in strong support of
 
03:09:23.349 --> 03:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
senate bill 69
 
03:09:25.349 --> 03:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
a bill designed to provide mothers
 
03:09:27.510 --> 03:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
returning to work with sufficient space
 
03:09:30.309 --> 03:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
and a reasonable break to express milk
 
03:09:32.150 --> 03:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
as has been said current breastfeeding
 
03:09:34.309 --> 03:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
legislation put forth by the affordable
 
03:09:37.349 --> 03:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
care act only covers hourly employees
 
03:09:40.150 --> 03:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
leaving a gap of one in four women new
 
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire is the only state in
 
03:09:43.910 --> 03:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
new england without its own workplace
 
03:09:45.590 --> 03:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding legislation
 
03:09:49.030 --> 03:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
so sp 69 would require employers to
 
03:09:51.190 --> 03:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
accommodate reasonable time and space
 
03:09:53.110 --> 03:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
for nursing moms to express work during
 
03:09:54.070 --> 03:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
the work day
 
03:09:57.110 --> 03:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
or to express milk during the work day
 
03:09:58.630 --> 03:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
this is important because this
 
03:10:00.229 --> 03:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
legislation has
 
03:10:02.550 --> 03:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
as has been said supports mothers but
 
03:10:05.429 --> 03:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
also families as their dynamics change
 
03:10:09.030 --> 03:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
and women transition back to work
 
03:10:11.110 --> 03:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
as a business owner and an industry
 
03:10:12.469 --> 03:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
leader i
 
03:10:14.870 --> 03:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
am sensitive to mandates that are often
 
03:10:16.150 --> 03:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
well intentioned
 
03:10:19.349 --> 03:10:19.359 align:start position:0%
but ultimately unnecessarily inhibit
 
03:10:20.630 --> 03:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
small business
 
03:10:22.070 --> 03:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the legislature
 
03:10:23.670 --> 03:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
should exercise
 
03:10:25.830 --> 03:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
great discretion when considering
 
03:10:25.840 --> 03:10:26.870 align:start position:0%
great discretion when considering
mandates

03:10:26.870 --> 03:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
03:10:29.110 --> 03:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
and only do so when there's a compelling
 
03:10:31.550 --> 03:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
overriding consideration
 
03:10:34.710 --> 03:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
sb69 is an opportunity to pass
 
03:10:34.720 --> 03:10:35.990 align:start position:0%
sb69 is an opportunity to pass
legislation

03:10:35.990 --> 03:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:10:38.550 --> 03:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
that supports women returning to work
 
03:10:39.990 --> 03:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
supports the healthiest
 
03:10:42.469 --> 03:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
option for children and puts new
 
03:10:43.750 --> 03:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire on par
 
03:10:45.429 --> 03:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
with other new england states who've
 
03:10:47.429 --> 03:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
already recognized the importance of
 
03:10:47.439 --> 03:10:47.830 align:start position:0%
already recognized the importance of
this

03:10:47.830 --> 03:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:10:51.349 --> 03:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
issue i jumped at the chance to champion
 
03:10:51.359 --> 03:10:51.750 align:start position:0%
issue i jumped at the chance to champion
this

03:10:51.750 --> 03:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:10:54.550 --> 03:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
initiative when my friend joyce kelly
 
03:10:55.990 --> 03:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
who's chairing the new hampshire
 
03:10:58.630 --> 03:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding task force invited me to
 
03:11:01.510 --> 03:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
speak to your committee today
 
03:11:04.790 --> 03:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
in fact our dealership participated in
 
03:11:07.910 --> 03:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
that mini grant program that lisa sirois
 
03:11:09.510 --> 03:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
had just spoken about
 
03:11:11.830 --> 03:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago and i attached to
 
03:11:14.150 --> 03:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
my testimony which i submitted
 
03:11:17.590 --> 03:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
a flyer of the lactation space that we
 
03:11:17.600 --> 03:11:18.229 align:start position:0%
a flyer of the lactation space that we
created

03:11:18.229 --> 03:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
created
 
03:11:21.910 --> 03:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
in our business we um were very proud of
 
03:11:23.269 --> 03:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
the space that we
 
03:11:25.269 --> 03:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
created we posted those flyers
 
03:11:26.790 --> 03:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
throughout our business
 
03:11:29.429 --> 03:11:29.439 align:start position:0%
and we encouraged the widespread use of
 
03:11:31.349 --> 03:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
the lactation lounge
 
03:11:34.630 --> 03:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
as we called it um among not only our
 
03:11:34.640 --> 03:11:35.269 align:start position:0%
as we called it um among not only our
employees

03:11:35.269 --> 03:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
employees
 
03:11:37.990 --> 03:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
but our customers and as someone
 
03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:38.630 align:start position:0%
but our customers and as someone
mentioned

03:11:38.630 --> 03:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
earlier the um the response was not only
 
03:11:41.600 --> 03:11:42.309 align:start position:0%
earlier the um the response was not only
positive

03:11:42.309 --> 03:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
positive
 
03:11:46.950 --> 03:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
we did see um the the returning loyalty
 
03:11:50.229 --> 03:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
and um increased productivity because
 
03:11:52.950 --> 03:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
our our people knew we we were genuinely
 
03:11:54.150 --> 03:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
invested in them
 
03:11:56.630 --> 03:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
and and i see as a business owner the
 
03:11:57.670 --> 03:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
how that helps with
 
03:12:00.870 --> 03:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
turnover which can be very costly
 
03:12:03.190 --> 03:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
this initiative resonates with me also
 
03:12:05.830 --> 03:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
as a working mom
 
03:12:08.790 --> 03:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
who nursed and because it's not only
 
03:12:10.309 --> 03:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
consistent with our corporate
 
03:12:12.630 --> 03:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
culture to be family friendly we were
 
03:12:16.790 --> 03:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
always looking for ways to empower women
 
03:12:18.870 --> 03:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
but something joyce kelly had said to me
 
03:12:20.389 --> 03:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
early on really stuck
 
03:12:22.389 --> 03:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
she said when women encounter barriers
 
03:12:23.510 --> 03:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
to nursing at work
 
03:12:25.670 --> 03:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's more likely they'll give up and
 
03:12:28.469 --> 03:12:28.479 align:start position:0%
instinctively i knew that this was true
 
03:12:30.469 --> 03:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
because i too struggled a lot with
 
03:12:31.990 --> 03:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
nursing but fortunately for
 
03:12:34.550 --> 03:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
me i didn't have to face obstacles at
 
03:12:36.550 --> 03:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
work or from a supervisor who didn't
 
03:12:36.560 --> 03:12:38.309 align:start position:0%
work or from a supervisor who didn't
understand

03:12:38.309 --> 03:12:38.319 align:start position:0%
understand
 
03:12:39.910 --> 03:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
i'm grateful for the people who
 
03:12:41.590 --> 03:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
encouraged me and helped me achieve
 
03:12:44.790 --> 03:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
some modicum of success in my nursing
 
03:12:47.910 --> 03:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
and i want all mothers to feel like they
 
03:12:48.630 --> 03:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
can do this
 
03:12:53.030 --> 03:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
and not give up on nursing or working
 
03:12:55.990 --> 03:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
giving up because of work pressures can
 
03:12:58.070 --> 03:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
be very painful for mothers
 
03:12:59.670 --> 03:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
who only wish to give their children the
 
03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
best possible start
 
03:13:03.349 --> 03:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
it can even discourage women from
 
03:13:05.030 --> 03:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
returning to work and that's not good
 
03:13:06.870 --> 03:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
for our economy
 
03:13:08.710 --> 03:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
and i wouldn't have been able to nurse
 
03:13:11.349 --> 03:13:11.359 align:start position:0%
my children if obstacles were in my way
 
03:13:14.870 --> 03:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
instead of encouragement and support
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
so eliminating workplace barriers will
 
03:13:18.150 --> 03:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
contribute to
 
03:13:20.790 --> 03:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
a mother's success here and have a great
 
03:13:20.800 --> 03:13:21.590 align:start position:0%
a mother's success here and have a great
positive

03:13:21.590 --> 03:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
positive
 
03:13:23.990 --> 03:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
impact on new hampshire families and
 
03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:25.269 align:start position:0%
impact on new hampshire families and
businesses

03:13:25.269 --> 03:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
03:13:28.469 --> 03:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
in closing sp 69 provides the necessary
 
03:13:30.070 --> 03:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
support for nursing mothers in the
 
03:13:30.080 --> 03:13:31.349 align:start position:0%

03:13:37.750 --> 03:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
and business growth as more mothers
 
03:13:39.030 --> 03:13:39.040 align:start position:0%

these
 
03:13:45.269 --> 03:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
reasons i'm asking for your support

um if employers benefit from reduced
retention

03:14:02.389 --> 03:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
retention
 
03:14:04.229 --> 03:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
and keeping better workers and tracking
 
03:14:05.510 --> 03:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
better workers
 
03:14:08.710 --> 03:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh why have the state mandated if
 
03:14:10.150 --> 03:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
employers are already doing this as much
 
03:14:11.590 --> 03:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
as they practically can
 
03:14:13.910 --> 03:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
why have the state step in and force
 
03:14:17.429 --> 03:14:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:19.590 --> 03:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
um i don't i don't know that they all
 
03:14:21.830 --> 03:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
see the forest through the trees
 
03:14:25.830 --> 03:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
um i think that my personal experience
 
03:14:29.510 --> 03:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
has been that by making this investment
 
03:14:32.710 --> 03:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
which sometimes seems hard at first when
 
03:14:33.510 --> 03:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
you're looking at
 
03:14:36.469 --> 03:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
change i've i've seen i've reaped the
 
03:14:37.990 --> 03:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
benefits of those decisions
 
03:14:40.469 --> 03:14:40.479 align:start position:0%
and so i'm speaking from my perspective
 
03:14:41.429 --> 03:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
i know
 
03:14:43.990 --> 03:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
that it increased our retention it
 
03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:44.710 align:start position:0%
that it increased our retention it
decreased

03:14:44.710 --> 03:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
decreased
 
03:14:47.910 --> 03:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
turnover we had happier when we sold
 
03:14:50.630 --> 03:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
our business a couple of months ago
 
03:14:52.389 --> 03:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
about a third of our business our
 
03:14:54.070 --> 03:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
employees worked for us for over 20
 
03:14:54.080 --> 03:14:54.550 align:start position:0%
employees worked for us for over 20
years

03:14:54.550 --> 03:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:14:57.030 --> 03:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
we were just a family that cared and
 
03:14:58.469 --> 03:14:58.479 align:start position:0%
people stayed with us so i
 
03:15:00.469 --> 03:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
mean i think it's a great investment and
 
03:15:02.229 --> 03:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
i know is it coming from an industry
 
03:15:04.710 --> 03:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
that was primarily male dominated
 
03:15:08.150 --> 03:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
we had a huge and growing um infusion of
 
03:15:09.910 --> 03:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
women over the last 10 years in our
 
03:15:12.710 --> 03:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
industry so
 
03:15:14.870 --> 03:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
that was my experience i think if if you
 
03:15:16.389 --> 03:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
invest in them they will come and they
 
03:15:20.309 --> 03:15:20.319 align:start position:0%
will stay
 
03:15:23.670 --> 03:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh
 
03:15:25.590 --> 03:15:25.600 align:start position:0%

new hampshire breastfeeding task force
 
03:16:08.550 --> 03:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire breastfeeding task
 
03:16:10.630 --> 03:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
force is an educational nonprofit
 
03:16:11.830 --> 03:16:11.840 align:start position:0%

03:16:16.150 --> 03:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
states breastfeeding committee our
 
03:16:17.510 --> 03:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
mission is to promote
 
03:16:19.110 --> 03:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
protect and support breastfeeding
 
03:16:20.550 --> 03:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
through education
 
03:16:23.349 --> 03:16:23.359 align:start position:0%
outreach and advocacy breastfeeding is
 
03:16:24.790 --> 03:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
regarded by all major health
 
03:16:26.550 --> 03:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
organizations as the optimal
 
03:16:29.429 --> 03:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
infant feeding method that supports
 
03:16:31.349 --> 03:16:31.359 align:start position:0%
improved health outcomes
 
03:16:32.950 --> 03:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
we have approximately 15 members
 
03:16:34.150 --> 03:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
throughout the state many of whom work
 
03:16:35.830 --> 03:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
in hospital settings but also community
 
03:16:35.840 --> 03:16:36.630 align:start position:0%
in hospital settings but also community
settings

03:16:36.630 --> 03:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
settings
 
03:16:39.830 --> 03:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
public health settings and educators
 
03:16:42.389 --> 03:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
senate bill 69 closes the gap that was
 
03:16:43.670 --> 03:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
unintentionally left
 
03:16:45.110 --> 03:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
by the federal breakdown for nursing
 
03:16:47.590 --> 03:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
mother laws passed in 2010
 
03:16:49.190 --> 03:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
that required employers to provide
 
03:16:51.349 --> 03:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
access to time and space for breast milk
 
03:16:53.110 --> 03:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
expression during the work day
 
03:16:55.110 --> 03:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
to hourly workers covered by the fair
 
03:16:56.630 --> 03:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
labor standards act
 
03:16:59.190 --> 03:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
so often we see questions raised about
 
03:16:59.750 --> 03:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
this in
 
03:17:03.030 --> 03:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
in in the testimony which we have today
 
03:17:05.429 --> 03:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
many of the workers conditions raised
 
03:17:07.990 --> 03:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
are already covered by the federal law
 
03:17:10.389 --> 03:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
but this senate bill 69 would require
 
03:17:12.229 --> 03:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
employers to provide access to time and
 
03:17:12.239 --> 03:17:13.030 align:start position:0%
employers to provide access to time and
space

03:17:13.030 --> 03:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
space
 
03:17:14.710 --> 03:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
to express milk during the workday for
 
03:17:17.510 --> 03:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
all workers regardless of labor category
 
03:17:18.950 --> 03:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
with the exceptions noted in the bill
 
03:17:20.870 --> 03:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
that um senator whitley had also
 
03:17:20.880 --> 03:17:21.830 align:start position:0%
that um senator whitley had also
mentioned

03:17:21.830 --> 03:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:17:24.309 --> 03:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
and this would include teachers who were
 
03:17:26.070 --> 03:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
excluded from federal protection so
 
03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
currently teachers
 
03:17:29.670 --> 03:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
do not have access to time and space to
 
03:17:31.750 --> 03:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
express milk during the workday
 
03:17:33.830 --> 03:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill 69 is the result of several
 
03:17:35.030 --> 03:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
years collaboration
 
03:17:36.550 --> 03:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
and work of the governor's advisory
 
03:17:38.630 --> 03:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
council lactation of which we were a
 
03:17:39.990 --> 03:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
part of
 
03:17:41.269 --> 03:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
we have collaborated with groups
 
03:17:43.030 --> 03:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
including the department of labor as
 
03:17:44.550 --> 03:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
well as the new hampshire business and
 
03:17:46.229 --> 03:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
industry association
 
03:17:47.910 --> 03:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
in order to craft a bill that we feel
 
03:17:49.830 --> 03:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
addresses the relevant needs related to
 
03:17:51.750 --> 03:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
workplace breastfeeding support
 
03:17:53.670 --> 03:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
that is comprehensive and a value to
 
03:17:56.389 --> 03:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
both employers and employees
 
03:17:57.910 --> 03:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
as stated new hampshire is the only
 
03:17:59.269 --> 03:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
state in new england that does not have
 
03:18:00.550 --> 03:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
a state level law
 
03:18:02.950 --> 03:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
to protect working mothers new hampshire
 
03:18:05.590 --> 03:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
senate bill 69 is a very reasonable bill
 
03:18:07.670 --> 03:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
that proposes accommodations for one
 
03:18:09.590 --> 03:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
year after the birth of a child for an
 
03:18:11.349 --> 03:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
employee to have access to time and
 
03:18:11.359 --> 03:18:11.990 align:start position:0%
employee to have access to time and
space

03:18:11.990 --> 03:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
space
 
03:18:14.630 --> 03:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
to pump during the workday other states
 
03:18:16.469 --> 03:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
such as maine and vermont have laws that
 
03:18:18.070 --> 03:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
are much more extensive including up to
 
03:18:19.750 --> 03:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
three years of protection
 
03:18:22.389 --> 03:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
we feel that the bill as drafted is a
 
03:18:23.750 --> 03:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire solution for working
 
03:18:25.750 --> 03:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
mothers and employees
 
03:18:27.510 --> 03:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
we did choose to define reasonable break
 
03:18:29.670 --> 03:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
time for approximately 30 minutes every
 
03:18:31.110 --> 03:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
three hours in a work day
 
03:18:33.429 --> 03:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
because one it is physiologically what
 
03:18:35.190 --> 03:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
most women need to maintain their milk
 
03:18:35.990 --> 03:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
supply when
 
03:18:37.510 --> 03:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
expressing milk went away from their
 
03:18:39.750 --> 03:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
baby and two because we have received
 
03:18:39.760 --> 03:18:40.070 align:start position:0%
baby and two because we have received
many

03:18:40.070 --> 03:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
many
 
03:18:41.830 --> 03:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
inquiries over the years from new
 
03:18:43.429 --> 03:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire businesses and hr
 
03:18:43.439 --> 03:18:44.870 align:start position:0%
hampshire businesses and hr
professionals

03:18:44.870 --> 03:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
03:18:47.030 --> 03:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
asking what is reasonable for a new mom
 
03:18:48.870 --> 03:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
to express milk during a workday because
 
03:18:49.510 --> 03:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
they just
 
03:18:51.750 --> 03:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
don't know please note that the bill
 
03:18:53.190 --> 03:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
does include language that
 
03:18:54.950 --> 03:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
allows an employer and an employee to
 
03:18:57.750 --> 03:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
agree to agree to different terms
 
03:18:59.190 --> 03:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
and while we have chosen to define
 
03:19:00.469 --> 03:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable break time there is
 
03:19:02.790 --> 03:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
variability from mother to mother
 
03:19:04.950 --> 03:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
in case the case often based on the age
 
03:19:06.070 --> 03:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
of the infant
 
03:19:07.910 --> 03:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
with the need for milk expression often
 
03:19:10.150 --> 03:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
becoming less over time as the baby gets
 
03:19:10.160 --> 03:19:10.710 align:start position:0%
becoming less over time as the baby gets
older

03:19:10.710 --> 03:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
older
 
03:19:14.150 --> 03:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
and mind you it is just for the one year
 
03:19:15.990 --> 03:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
it is important to note that this bill
 
03:19:18.229 --> 03:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
does not necessarily require an employer
 
03:19:20.070 --> 03:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
to undertake the construction
 
03:19:21.910 --> 03:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
or building of a room solely for the
 
03:19:23.750 --> 03:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
purposes of milk expression
 
03:19:25.670 --> 03:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
this bill provides for access to time
 
03:19:27.030 --> 03:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
and space to pump
 
03:19:28.950 --> 03:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
it may be temporary or maybe a permanent
 
03:19:31.429 --> 03:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
space but even when an employer chooses
 
03:19:33.190 --> 03:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
to make a permanent space it can often
 
03:19:35.590 --> 03:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
be completed at a nominal cost i was
 
03:19:37.510 --> 03:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
one of the consultants on the mini
 
03:19:40.550 --> 03:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
grants and we saw quite the variety of
 
03:19:43.269 --> 03:19:43.279 align:start position:0%
spaces we have resources available to
 
03:19:45.349 --> 03:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
help people do that
 
03:19:47.510 --> 03:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
this bill makes sense it would benefit
 
03:19:48.550 --> 03:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
employers with
 
03:19:50.070 --> 03:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
improved worker retention and
 
03:19:52.389 --> 03:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
satisfaction and it has been
 
03:19:53.750 --> 03:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
recently established that there's
 
03:19:55.990 --> 03:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
approximately a three to one return on
 
03:19:56.000 --> 03:19:56.790 align:start position:0%
approximately a three to one return on
investment

03:19:56.790 --> 03:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
investment
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
for employers who have established a
 
03:19:59.510 --> 03:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
workplace breastfeeding program for
 
03:20:01.110 --> 03:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
their employees
 
03:20:03.429 --> 03:20:03.439 align:start position:0%

the opportunity to testify today
 
03:21:46.389 --> 03:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
when i returned to work after having my
 
03:21:48.469 --> 03:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
first son in 2019
 
03:21:50.710 --> 03:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
i was not ready i was not prepared for
 
03:21:52.150 --> 03:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
the stress that came with figuring out
 
03:21:53.590 --> 03:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
my new normal
 
03:21:54.950 --> 03:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
how to get out of the house with a baby
 
03:21:56.790 --> 03:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
in tow how it would feel dropping him
 
03:21:58.309 --> 03:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
off at daycare while i headed to work
 
03:21:59.590 --> 03:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
for eight hours
 
03:22:01.190 --> 03:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
i heard i would have to advocate for
 
03:22:03.510 --> 03:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
myself and for my son
 
03:22:05.750 --> 03:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
because i had a shared office i needed a
 
03:22:07.670 --> 03:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
separate space to express milk while at
 
03:22:07.680 --> 03:22:08.710 align:start position:0%
separate space to express milk while at
work

03:22:08.710 --> 03:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:22:10.790 --> 03:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
i had had a conversation with my manager
 
03:22:12.229 --> 03:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
prior to my return
 
03:22:13.750 --> 03:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i was told they had a space for me
 
03:22:17.190 --> 03:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
to use that space was a storage closet
 
03:22:19.750 --> 03:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
it was hot the door didn't lock and it
 
03:22:21.349 --> 03:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't private
 
03:22:23.510 --> 03:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
i knew this space wasn't adequate it
 
03:22:25.429 --> 03:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't sanitary
 
03:22:27.830 --> 03:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
but i was told it was all there was
 
03:22:29.510 --> 03:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
after a couple of weeks sweating in this
 
03:22:31.429 --> 03:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
storage closet as i expressed the food
 
03:22:32.790 --> 03:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
to feed my child
 
03:22:35.110 --> 03:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
i knew i needed to advocate for myself
 
03:22:36.870 --> 03:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
because if i didn't this is what i was
 
03:22:39.349 --> 03:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
what i would be stuck with i reached out
 
03:22:40.469 --> 03:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
to human resources
 
03:22:41.990 --> 03:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
and my employer and i explained the
 
03:22:44.469 --> 03:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
situation it took a few weeks but a new
 
03:22:45.830 --> 03:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
space was found
 
03:22:48.070 --> 03:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
an empty office two floors up i felt
 
03:22:50.469 --> 03:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
like i had won the lottery
 
03:22:52.469 --> 03:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
my job required me to attend events and
 
03:22:54.950 --> 03:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
conferences outside of my office
 
03:22:56.870 --> 03:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
anytime i would attend an event or
 
03:22:58.870 --> 03:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
conference i would reach out to the
 
03:23:00.710 --> 03:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
organizers and let them know that i'm a
 
03:23:00.720 --> 03:23:01.110 align:start position:0%
organizers and let them know that i'm a
mom

03:23:01.110 --> 03:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
mom
 
03:23:04.070 --> 03:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
and i asked about a lactation space when
 
03:23:05.910 --> 03:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
i asked about a lactation space i was
 
03:23:07.670 --> 03:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
often met with looks of annoyance
 
03:23:09.269 --> 03:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
and disgust and was told there was no
 
03:23:10.870 --> 03:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
space for me
 
03:23:12.870 --> 03:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
i have expressed milk in numerous public
 
03:23:15.110 --> 03:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
bathrooms hoping that the power cord to
 
03:23:16.550 --> 03:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
my pump would reach the only outlet
 
03:23:16.560 --> 03:23:17.750 align:start position:0%
my pump would reach the only outlet
available

03:23:17.750 --> 03:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:23:19.590 --> 03:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
i have expressed milk in my car in the
 
03:23:21.670 --> 03:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
middle of winter to avoid having to pump
 
03:23:23.429 --> 03:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
in a bathroom again
 
03:23:25.030 --> 03:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
and i have expressed milk in a storage
 
03:23:26.710 --> 03:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
closet behind a bar at a conference
 
03:23:26.720 --> 03:23:28.229 align:start position:0%
closet behind a bar at a conference
venue

03:23:28.229 --> 03:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
venue
 
03:23:29.830 --> 03:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
yes i have learned how to advocate for
 
03:23:31.750 --> 03:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
myself and my child during our
 
03:23:32.790 --> 03:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding journey
 
03:23:34.870 --> 03:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
but lactation spaces should be the norm
 
03:23:36.550 --> 03:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
not the exception
 
03:23:37.990 --> 03:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
there is enough stress put on the
 
03:23:40.389 --> 03:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
shoulders of mothers and working mothers
 
03:23:42.070 --> 03:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
where and when she can express milk to
 
03:23:43.670 --> 03:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
feed her child should not be the cause
 
03:23:43.990 --> 03:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
of any
 
03:23:46.710 --> 03:23:46.720 align:start position:0%

03:25:36.870 --> 03:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
sue not
 
03:25:38.630 --> 03:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
whether there was any discrimination or
 
03:25:41.590 --> 03:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
not and because there was a tie
 
03:25:44.630 --> 03:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
by default i lost there's been new
 
03:25:46.389 --> 03:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
motions filed
 
03:25:50.389 --> 03:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
um so the case is not over yet um what
 
03:25:52.150 --> 03:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
i'd like to talk to you about today
 
03:25:55.349 --> 03:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
is obviously this bill um i don't think
 
03:25:55.359 --> 03:25:56.429 align:start position:0%
is obviously this bill um i don't think
it's

03:25:56.429 --> 03:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:25:59.030 --> 03:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional which is why i'm opposing
 
03:25:59.040 --> 03:25:59.990 align:start position:0%
constitutional which is why i'm opposing
it

03:25:59.990 --> 03:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:26:01.830 --> 03:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
and i want to point out some of the
 
03:26:01.840 --> 03:26:03.590 align:start position:0%
and i want to point out some of the
flaws

03:26:03.590 --> 03:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
flaws
 
03:26:05.269 --> 03:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
and problems with this bill but i want
 
03:26:07.349 --> 03:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
to do it very briefly
 
03:26:10.389 --> 03:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
so similar to lat the last hearing
 
03:26:13.990 --> 03:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
i submitted my report my testimony
 
03:26:16.870 --> 03:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
on page three i just want to refer you
 
03:26:16.880 --> 03:26:19.670 align:start position:0%
on page three i just want to refer you
to

03:26:19.670 --> 03:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:26:22.950 --> 03:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
rsa 275 37a
 
03:26:25.269 --> 03:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
smokers rights there's actually
 
03:26:28.309 --> 03:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
statutory protection
 
03:26:30.389 --> 03:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
against discriminating against employees
 
03:26:31.590 --> 03:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
who smoke
 
03:26:34.870 --> 03:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
but there is not any statutory
 
03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
protection against
 
03:26:40.790 --> 03:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:44.070 --> 03:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is a pumping only bill and it
 
03:26:46.870 --> 03:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
specifically states that expressing milk
 
03:26:49.910 --> 03:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
excludes breastfeeding
 
03:26:52.229 --> 03:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
so let me explain to you the result of
 
03:26:52.239 --> 03:26:52.950 align:start position:0%
so let me explain to you the result of
that

03:26:52.950 --> 03:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:26:55.030 --> 03:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
what what you're going to have is what
 
03:26:59.269 --> 03:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:03.510 --> 03:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
i requested privacy to breastfeed
 
03:27:05.670 --> 03:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
during work hours because my son was not
 
03:27:07.590 --> 03:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
able to drink from a bottle yet
 
03:27:11.349 --> 03:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
as an infant and i was told i had to
 
03:27:12.870 --> 03:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
breastfeed in a public
 
03:27:15.830 --> 03:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
space either in front of my clients my
 
03:27:15.840 --> 03:27:16.790 align:start position:0%
space either in front of my clients my
co-workers

03:27:16.790 --> 03:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
co-workers
 
03:27:19.269 --> 03:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
or outside in the parking lot or sitting
 
03:27:20.950 --> 03:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
on the stairwell
 
03:27:22.630 --> 03:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
in an office building with multiple
 
03:27:24.389 --> 03:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
offices so
 
03:27:27.030 --> 03:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
if i had been willing to expose my
 
03:27:27.990 --> 03:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
breasts and my
 
03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:31.030 align:start position:0%
breasts and my
baby

03:27:31.030 --> 03:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:34.710 --> 03:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
and be naked from the top up
 
03:27:37.510 --> 03:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
potentially i suppose i would have kept
 
03:27:38.070 --> 03:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
my job
 
03:27:40.070 --> 03:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
but i wasn't willing to do that to keep
 
03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
my job i wanted privacy
 
03:27:46.550 --> 03:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:49.510 --> 03:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
recently the new hampshire legislature
 
03:27:50.950 --> 03:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
and i commend them
 
03:27:53.750 --> 03:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
passed a bill making it illegal to
 
03:27:55.750 --> 03:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
discriminate against someone for their
 
03:27:55.760 --> 03:27:56.550 align:start position:0%
discriminate against someone for their
gender

03:27:56.550 --> 03:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
gender
 
03:28:00.070 --> 03:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
including transgender well guess what
 
03:28:00.080 --> 03:28:00.790 align:start position:0%
including transgender well guess what
folks

03:28:00.790 --> 03:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
folks
 
03:28:03.830 --> 03:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
transgender people can breastfeed they
 
03:28:04.630 --> 03:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
can also
 
03:28:08.469 --> 03:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
chest feed and what you're gonna create
 
03:28:08.479 --> 03:28:09.110 align:start position:0%
chest feed and what you're gonna create
here

03:28:09.110 --> 03:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:28:15.110 --> 03:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
to feed their babies directly in public
 
03:28:21.510 --> 03:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
and many of them may not want to many of
 
03:28:22.790 --> 03:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
them may want
 
03:28:25.990 --> 03:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
privacy like i did there's also the
 
03:28:28.870 --> 03:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
issue of safety
 
03:28:31.990 --> 03:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
so this bill leaves out
 
03:28:34.309 --> 03:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
break time for breastfeeding or chest
 
03:28:35.429 --> 03:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
feeding and
 
03:28:38.870 --> 03:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
space private safe space
 
03:28:42.469 --> 03:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
for breastfeeding or chest feeding
 
03:28:46.630 --> 03:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to also explain
 
03:28:48.790 --> 03:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
this may seem very basic to some of you
 
03:28:48.800 --> 03:28:49.830 align:start position:0%
this may seem very basic to some of you
but

03:28:49.830 --> 03:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:28:52.870 --> 03:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
what is a nursing mother
 
03:28:54.870 --> 03:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
is it a breastfeeding mother is it a
 
03:28:57.670 --> 03:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:00.870 --> 03:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
is it chest feeding person is
 
03:29:04.309 --> 03:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
it an employee who's lactating and
 
03:29:06.150 --> 03:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
their baby died at childbirth but
 
03:29:08.150 --> 03:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
they're pumping so that they can donate
 
03:29:08.160 --> 03:29:09.429 align:start position:0%
they're pumping so that they can donate
milk

03:29:09.429 --> 03:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
milk
 
03:29:12.630 --> 03:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
to a milk bank typically
 
03:29:16.790 --> 03:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
a nursing mother can be all of these
 
03:29:20.229 --> 03:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
you may pump you may breastfeed
 
03:29:23.590 --> 03:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
etc at different times depending on
 
03:29:26.229 --> 03:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
different situations
 
03:29:29.990 --> 03:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
i support a bill that provides
 
03:29:32.870 --> 03:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
an incremental bit of success i don't
 
03:29:34.790 --> 03:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
think this bill does
 
03:29:36.550 --> 03:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
i think this bill is going backwards
 
03:29:39.510 --> 03:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
which is why i'm opposing it
 
03:29:41.750 --> 03:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know priest for governor sununu i
 
03:29:43.750 --> 03:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
have to say
 
03:29:46.870 --> 03:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
i'm a fan he
 
03:29:48.780 --> 03:29:48.790 align:start position:0%
implemented the executive order
 
03:29:48.790 --> 03:29:50.870 align:start position:0%
implemented the executive order
[Music]

03:29:50.870 --> 03:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:29:54.550 --> 03:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
allowing state employees like i was
 
03:29:55.910 --> 03:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
to bring their babies to work to
 
03:29:57.750 --> 03:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
breastfeed them during work hours
 
03:30:00.830 --> 03:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
because he values the importance of
 
03:30:00.840 --> 03:30:05.269 align:start position:0%
because he values the importance of
breastfeeding

03:30:05.269 --> 03:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:07.110 --> 03:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
this this bill is going backwards
 
03:30:09.190 --> 03:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
because instead of codifying the
 
03:30:11.670 --> 03:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
executive order
 
03:30:14.590 --> 03:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
into statute it's excluding
 
03:30:14.600 --> 03:30:15.830 align:start position:0%
into statute it's excluding
breastfeeding

03:30:15.830 --> 03:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding
 
03:30:19.429 --> 03:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
so in order to be brief
 
03:30:22.630 --> 03:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
i will leave my comment
 
03:30:28.150 --> 03:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
with one more point there's currently a
 
03:30:32.630 --> 03:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
federal law i'm sorry a federal bill
 
03:30:34.550 --> 03:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
that is looking to accomplish something
 
03:30:36.790 --> 03:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
very similar
 
03:30:39.590 --> 03:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature could wait and see what
 
03:30:42.070 --> 03:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
happens with the federal bill
 
03:30:44.150 --> 03:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's called providing urgent maternal
 
03:30:44.160 --> 03:30:45.269 align:start position:0%
it's called providing urgent maternal
protections

03:30:45.269 --> 03:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
protections
 
03:30:49.030 --> 03:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
in the nursing mothers act lastly
 
03:30:51.830 --> 03:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
i think that the state of new hampshire
 
03:30:51.840 --> 03:30:54.870 align:start position:0%
i think that the state of new hampshire
spends

03:30:54.870 --> 03:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:56.830 --> 03:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of money on supporting
 
03:30:56.840 --> 03:30:58.630 align:start position:0%
a lot of money on supporting
breastfeeding

03:30:58.630 --> 03:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding
 
03:31:00.070 --> 03:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
i don't see how you can support
 
03:31:03.510 --> 03:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding by excluding breastfeeding
 
03:31:06.309 --> 03:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
or firing someone for breastfeeding or
 
03:31:08.150 --> 03:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
needing to breastfeed
 
03:31:12.630 --> 03:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
and i don't feel that an employee
 
03:31:16.229 --> 03:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
should have to negotiate to keep her
 
03:31:20.950 --> 03:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:23.030 --> 03:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't seem like the new
 
03:31:25.670 --> 03:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire way to me
 
03:31:29.269 --> 03:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:31:32.070 --> 03:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative abramson has a question
 
03:31:33.110 --> 03:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
03:31:35.750 --> 03:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
03:31:36.630 --> 03:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
this bill as
 
03:31:39.990 --> 03:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
written it's your concern
 
03:31:43.110 --> 03:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
in your testimony that that the
 
03:31:45.110 --> 03:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
unknown cost of this or the problems of
 
03:31:47.110 --> 03:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
this bill can make it more difficult
 
03:31:50.550 --> 03:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
for employers to hire nursing mothers
 
03:31:54.790 --> 03:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
for nursing mothers to find work
 
03:31:57.349 --> 03:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
i apologize let me tell you if what i
 
03:31:59.190 --> 03:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
heard is what you said
 
03:32:01.429 --> 03:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
you're asking me if my our concerns are
 
03:32:04.469 --> 03:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
about financial needs or about
 
03:32:06.870 --> 03:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
access to work for the uh for the
 
03:32:08.870 --> 03:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
employers facing the cost of this
 
03:32:12.309 --> 03:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
this uh unfunded mandate is it is it
 
03:32:13.670 --> 03:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
going to make it more difficult for
 
03:32:16.309 --> 03:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
employers to employ nursing mothers
 
03:32:17.990 --> 03:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
and could it make it more difficult for
 
03:32:19.510 --> 03:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
nursing mothers to find work in the
 
03:32:19.520 --> 03:32:21.269 align:start position:0%
nursing mothers to find work in the
workplace

03:32:21.269 --> 03:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
workplace
 
03:32:25.110 --> 03:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
i see you know similar to
 
03:32:27.030 --> 03:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
your question in the last hearing
 
03:32:28.790 --> 03:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the answer is
 
03:32:32.790 --> 03:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
possibly probably with some exception
 
03:32:36.309 --> 03:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
a few employers may take advantage and
 
03:32:39.190 --> 03:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
illegally discriminate but i believe
 
03:32:40.710 --> 03:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
that most employers want
 
03:32:43.349 --> 03:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing but the problem is
 
03:32:44.389 --> 03:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
employers need
 
03:32:47.190 --> 03:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
certainty right they need to know what's
 
03:32:48.710 --> 03:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
going to happen when
 
03:32:50.550 --> 03:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
how long is it going to take how much
 
03:32:52.469 --> 03:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
money is it going to take
 
03:32:54.710 --> 03:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
and how will that affect everything else
 
03:32:56.630 --> 03:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:32:58.950 --> 03:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
when you have pregnancy or you're
 
03:33:00.710 --> 03:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
lactating you don't always have those
 
03:33:01.750 --> 03:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
answers on hand
 
03:33:05.269 --> 03:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
and it also fluctuates
 
03:33:08.150 --> 03:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like a moving target so
 
03:33:09.910 --> 03:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's the conflict is the employees
 
03:33:11.510 --> 03:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
can't always give the employer the
 
03:33:13.910 --> 03:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
certainty that they need to feel
 
03:33:16.710 --> 03:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
confident confident and comfortable and
 
03:33:19.510 --> 03:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
plan ahead
 
03:33:22.389 --> 03:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
so what the federal bills have done and
 
03:33:22.399 --> 03:33:23.349 align:start position:0%
so what the federal bills have done and
what

03:33:23.349 --> 03:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:33:25.670 --> 03:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
maine vermont and massachusetts have
 
03:33:25.680 --> 03:33:26.630 align:start position:0%
maine vermont and massachusetts have
done

03:33:26.630 --> 03:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:33:29.110 --> 03:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
all the states that are adjacent to new
 
03:33:29.120 --> 03:33:30.790 align:start position:0%
all the states that are adjacent to new
hampshire

03:33:30.790 --> 03:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:33:32.070 --> 03:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
they've found a way to allow
 
03:33:34.150 --> 03:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding during work hours
 
03:33:37.830 --> 03:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
and they have a provision that says um
 
03:33:40.389 --> 03:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
the employee is allowed to breastfeed
 
03:33:40.399 --> 03:33:41.190 align:start position:0%
the employee is allowed to breastfeed
anywhere

03:33:41.190 --> 03:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
03:33:43.670 --> 03:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
they are authorized to be or anywhere
 
03:33:44.790 --> 03:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
they and their child
 
03:33:47.830 --> 03:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
are authorized to be so breastfeeding
 
03:33:47.840 --> 03:33:49.269 align:start position:0%
are authorized to be so breastfeeding
accommodations

03:33:49.269 --> 03:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
accommodations
 
03:33:51.510 --> 03:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
don't cause anything if you're willing
 
03:33:54.790 --> 03:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:58.150 --> 03:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
if you need to create a space i think
 
03:34:02.150 --> 03:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
probably senator whitley or maybe it was
 
03:34:05.510 --> 03:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
joyce kelly said that this is just a
 
03:34:08.710 --> 03:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
temporary structure nobody's
 
03:34:12.150 --> 03:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
being told to create a brand new office
 
03:34:16.070 --> 03:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
um you could even use a pop-up tent
 
03:34:19.269 --> 03:34:19.279 align:start position:0%
so i can share with you um
 
03:34:23.670 --> 03:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
a website that breaks down
 
03:34:27.349 --> 03:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
how to create a space in any industry
 
03:34:29.429 --> 03:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
i'll email you the website but it's on
 
03:34:32.229 --> 03:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
women's health dot gov
 
03:34:35.750 --> 03:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
slash supporting nursing moms
 
03:34:38.229 --> 03:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
etc i'll send it to you right now so you
 
03:34:39.990 --> 03:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
can see it and it breaks it down by
 
03:34:41.510 --> 03:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
restaurants hotels
 
03:34:44.950 --> 03:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
retail road construction
 
03:34:51.269 --> 03:34:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:54.790 --> 03:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh we have another question
 
03:34:56.229 --> 03:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
03:34:57.910 --> 03:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
03:34:59.990 --> 03:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um i'd like to see
 
03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:00.469 align:start position:0%
taking my question um i'd like to see
where

03:35:00.469 --> 03:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:35:02.150 --> 03:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
um in this bill you're saying that
 
03:35:04.070 --> 03:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding is excluded
 
03:35:06.469 --> 03:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
because what i see it is has to do with
 
03:35:08.790 --> 03:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
um the employer
 
03:35:11.429 --> 03:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
needing to make a accommodation for
 
03:35:11.439 --> 03:35:12.389 align:start position:0%
needing to make a accommodation for
pumping

03:35:12.389 --> 03:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
pumping
 
03:35:14.469 --> 03:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
it does i don't see where it excludes
 
03:35:14.479 --> 03:35:15.830 align:start position:0%
it does i don't see where it excludes
breastfeeding

03:35:15.830 --> 03:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding
 
03:35:18.870 --> 03:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
definition of expressing milk so this
 
03:35:22.150 --> 03:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
still defines expressing milk
 
03:35:25.269 --> 03:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
as excluding breastfeeding i don't i
 
03:35:27.110 --> 03:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
don't see where it says excluding
 
03:35:29.750 --> 03:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding this shall not include
 
03:35:31.030 --> 03:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding i believe i
 
03:35:33.269 --> 03:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
i can find it exactly for you if you
 
03:35:35.030 --> 03:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
want okay would you find that please
 
03:35:40.150 --> 03:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:43.910 --> 03:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
roman numeral three expression of milk
 
03:35:45.910 --> 03:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
means the initiation of lactation by
 
03:35:47.990 --> 03:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
manual or mechanical means but shall not
 
03:35:48.000 --> 03:35:48.469 align:start position:0%
manual or mechanical means but shall not
include

03:35:48.469 --> 03:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
include
 
03:35:51.030 --> 03:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding but that's just a
 
03:35:54.469 --> 03:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
definition of expression of milk
 
03:35:58.950 --> 03:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
that doesn't say you can't breastfeed it
 
03:36:00.790 --> 03:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
shall not include breastfeeding so
 
03:36:03.590 --> 03:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
employ employers do not have to provide
 
03:36:05.349 --> 03:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
accommodations for breastfeeding this
 
03:36:05.359 --> 03:36:06.550 align:start position:0%
accommodations for breastfeeding this
bill

03:36:06.550 --> 03:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:36:09.990 --> 03:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
says you have to provide accommodations
 
03:36:13.349 --> 03:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
for expression of milk shall not include
 
03:36:13.359 --> 03:36:14.550 align:start position:0%
for expression of milk shall not include
breastfeeding

03:36:14.550 --> 03:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding
 
03:36:16.710 --> 03:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
so what representative bartlett what i
 
03:36:17.910 --> 03:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
was told by
 
03:36:20.070 --> 03:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire was the
 
03:36:22.150 --> 03:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
lactation room was only for pumping
 
03:36:23.830 --> 03:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
no breastfeeding allowed in the
 
03:36:26.229 --> 03:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
lactation room there's a
 
03:36:28.469 --> 03:36:28.479 align:start position:0%
the federal law is the nursing mother's
 
03:36:28.479 --> 03:36:29.750 align:start position:0%
the federal law is the nursing mother's
provision

03:36:29.750 --> 03:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
provision
 
03:36:32.389 --> 03:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
it amended the fair labor standards act
 
03:36:34.550 --> 03:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
in the affordable care act
 
03:36:38.710 --> 03:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
and it used the terms express milk
 
03:36:41.910 --> 03:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't include breastfeeding i'm
 
03:36:43.190 --> 03:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
sorry i have to disagree i don't see
 
03:36:43.910 --> 03:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
that in that
 
03:36:50.150 --> 03:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
in the bill would you believe
 
03:36:53.590 --> 03:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh are there any other
 
03:36:57.830 --> 03:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we thank you again
 
03:36:57.840 --> 03:36:58.630 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we thank you again
it's

03:36:58.630 --> 03:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:37:01.990 --> 03:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
always a pleasure seeing you again all
 
03:37:02.000 --> 03:37:02.389 align:start position:0%
always a pleasure seeing you again all
right

03:37:02.389 --> 03:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:37:04.550 --> 03:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
so having no other person now we'll have
 
03:37:05.830 --> 03:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
the last the light
 
03:37:08.070 --> 03:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh miss malachi you now have the last
 
03:37:08.080 --> 03:37:15.110 align:start position:0%
uh miss malachi you now have the last
word

03:37:15.110 --> 03:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:18.309 --> 03:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:21.349 --> 03:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
i am here thank you
 
03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um so
 
03:37:27.590 --> 03:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
there's been a plethora of testimony on
 
03:37:29.190 --> 03:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
the previous bill
 
03:37:32.309 --> 03:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
and some of those those items certainly
 
03:37:35.429 --> 03:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
are still standing um as we're in a
 
03:37:38.469 --> 03:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
in pretty much the same topic i wanted
 
03:37:38.479 --> 03:37:39.030 align:start position:0%
in pretty much the same topic i wanted
to

03:37:39.030 --> 03:37:39.040 align:start position:0%

03:37:56.229 --> 03:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
lisa sirois and joyce kelly from the new
 
03:37:58.630 --> 03:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire breastfeeding task force
 
03:38:01.030 --> 03:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
for all of the work and and their
 
03:38:03.670 --> 03:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
testimony that's been given
 
03:38:07.190 --> 03:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
although sb 69 does not directly affect
 
03:38:09.830 --> 03:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
the commission the human rights
 
03:38:09.840 --> 03:38:10.710 align:start position:0%
the commission the human rights
commission

03:38:10.710 --> 03:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:38:13.990 --> 03:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
had two members on the
 
03:38:17.670 --> 03:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
um on the lactation council which worked
 
03:38:17.680 --> 03:38:19.030 align:start position:0%
um on the lactation council which worked
collaboratively

03:38:19.030 --> 03:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
collaboratively
 
03:38:22.710 --> 03:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
to put this bill together and i believe
 
03:38:25.349 --> 03:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
senator whitley stated that this bill
 
03:38:27.030 --> 03:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
was something that was
 
03:38:28.870 --> 03:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
moving through the process the
 
03:38:31.269 --> 03:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
legislative process last cycle
 
03:38:33.990 --> 03:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
but as so many things got laid on the
 
03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:34.630 align:start position:0%
but as so many things got laid on the
table

03:38:34.630 --> 03:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
table
 
03:38:38.710 --> 03:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
due to covid this was one of them and
 
03:38:41.189 --> 03:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
the commission would certainly like to
 
03:38:42.469 --> 03:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
express their support
 
03:38:45.910 --> 03:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
for sb69 for it to pass as written
 
03:38:47.990 --> 03:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
for their there are no additional
 
03:38:49.429 --> 03:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
amendments or changes
 
03:38:52.710 --> 03:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
that need to be made and
 
03:38:54.950 --> 03:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
mothers and families have had to wait
 
03:38:56.469 --> 03:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
especially mothers in the workplace and
 
03:38:58.710 --> 03:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
and businesses have had to wait uh quite
 
03:39:00.550 --> 03:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
a while for this so it would be
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
um wonderful if the committee would
 
03:39:05.750 --> 03:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
vote this as ought to pass and move it
 
03:39:05.760 --> 03:39:06.870 align:start position:0%
vote this as ought to pass and move it
along

03:39:06.870 --> 03:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
along
 
03:39:09.110 --> 03:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
i know that there was at least a a a
 
03:39:10.790 --> 03:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
question relative to
 
03:39:13.189 --> 03:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
accommodation and um and i also
 
03:39:14.950 --> 03:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative bartlett's
 
03:39:14.960 --> 03:39:15.990 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative bartlett's
understanding

03:39:15.990 --> 03:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
03:39:18.150 --> 03:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
um when i re-read that section it looks
 
03:39:19.189 --> 03:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
as though you were
 
03:39:21.189 --> 03:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
correct in that that that was part of
 
03:39:23.670 --> 03:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
the definition and not expressly
 
03:39:26.950 --> 03:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
um moving removing breastfeeding um and
 
03:39:26.960 --> 03:39:27.510 align:start position:0%
um moving removing breastfeeding um and
again

03:39:27.510 --> 03:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:39:29.510 --> 03:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
when you talk about reasonable
 
03:39:29.520 --> 03:39:30.710 align:start position:0%
when you talk about reasonable
accommodations

03:39:30.710 --> 03:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
accommodations
 
03:39:32.309 --> 03:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
um and i don't remember the woman's name
 
03:39:34.710 --> 03:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
that testified earlier that has a
 
03:39:37.670 --> 03:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
cart that had the family car dealership
 
03:39:37.680 --> 03:39:38.150 align:start position:0%
cart that had the family car dealership
if

03:39:38.150 --> 03:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:39:41.349 --> 03:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
in that conversation um and i
 
03:39:45.110 --> 03:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
happened to have my child nearby i mean
 
03:39:47.189 --> 03:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh and that would have to be something
 
03:39:48.309 --> 03:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
that you would have to discuss
 
03:39:51.590 --> 03:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
because the average woman that's working
 
03:39:53.910 --> 03:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
may not be one that is currently
 
03:39:53.920 --> 03:39:54.870 align:start position:0%
may not be one that is currently
breastfeeding

03:39:54.870 --> 03:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding
 
03:39:57.990 --> 03:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
during her work shift right so when i go
 
03:39:58.000 --> 03:39:58.469 align:start position:0%
during her work shift right so when i go
home

03:39:58.469 --> 03:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
home
 
03:40:00.790 --> 03:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
i may do that with my child and i
 
03:40:03.110 --> 03:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
primarily would need a place
 
03:40:05.510 --> 03:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
for expression of milk now if my
 
03:40:05.520 --> 03:40:06.309 align:start position:0%
for expression of milk now if my
employer

03:40:06.309 --> 03:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
employer
 
03:40:09.269 --> 03:40:09.279 align:start position:0%
says hey i don't mind someone dropping
 
03:40:10.870 --> 03:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
off your child and you can nurse your
 
03:40:10.880 --> 03:40:11.349 align:start position:0%
off your child and you can nurse your
child

03:40:11.349 --> 03:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:40:13.349 --> 03:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
during the same amount of time where i
 
03:40:14.550 --> 03:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
would normally
 
03:40:17.030 --> 03:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
do my milk expression great that's
 
03:40:17.040 --> 03:40:17.990 align:start position:0%
do my milk expression great that's
between

03:40:17.990 --> 03:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:40:20.870 --> 03:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
the woman and her employer and that
 
03:40:21.990 --> 03:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
could be considered
 
03:40:23.750 --> 03:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
as we've talked before a reasonable
 
03:40:23.760 --> 03:40:25.030 align:start position:0%
as we've talked before a reasonable
accommodation

03:40:25.030 --> 03:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
03:40:27.110 --> 03:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
what might not be reasonable is if the
 
03:40:29.189 --> 03:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
employee is requesting during their
 
03:40:30.469 --> 03:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
eight hour shift
 
03:40:33.590 --> 03:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
to leave the office or the place of work
 
03:40:36.070 --> 03:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
multiple times to go to a place where
 
03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
the child is located
 
03:40:40.870 --> 03:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
to then nurse the child and come back
 
03:40:42.790 --> 03:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
that may not be reasonable and that
 
03:40:44.229 --> 03:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
would but that would again be a
 
03:40:44.239 --> 03:40:45.429 align:start position:0%
would but that would again be a
conversation

03:40:45.429 --> 03:40:45.439 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
03:40:47.510 --> 03:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
that the employee and the employer would
 
03:40:49.990 --> 03:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
have if the employer allows that person
 
03:40:52.870 --> 03:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
to make up work because that's okay and
 
03:40:53.830 --> 03:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
they would have
 
03:40:55.990 --> 03:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
maybe two hours out of their eight hour
 
03:40:57.510 --> 03:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
day in order to do that
 
03:40:59.990 --> 03:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's great but this bill doesn't
 
03:41:02.229 --> 03:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
change the flexibility
 
03:41:04.790 --> 03:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
that an employee and an employer would
 
03:41:06.389 --> 03:41:06.399 align:start position:0%
have to work together
 
03:41:09.830 --> 03:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
it simply allows there to be a clean
 
03:41:12.790 --> 03:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
safe and private place for this
 
03:41:13.990 --> 03:41:14.000 align:start position:0%

room with you all
 
03:43:10.229 --> 03:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
joanna my daughter struggled to latch
 
03:43:11.670 --> 03:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
when she was born
 
03:43:13.990 --> 03:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
after a stressful first week of life
 
03:43:15.429 --> 03:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
filled with doctors appointments and
 
03:43:17.510 --> 03:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
unwelcomed weight loss we took joanna to
 
03:43:19.189 --> 03:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
a pediatric dentist and
 
03:43:21.990 --> 03:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
revised her tongue ties and for the next
 
03:43:23.670 --> 03:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
six weeks joanna and i with
 
03:43:26.150 --> 03:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
the fierce support of my husband worked
 
03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
hard to get joanna to
 
03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
improve her ability to latch we took her
 
03:43:31.670 --> 03:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
to many
 
03:43:34.309 --> 03:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
ot appointments and the pediatricians a
 
03:43:35.670 --> 03:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
number of times we worked with a
 
03:43:37.429 --> 03:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
lactation consultant
 
03:43:39.030 --> 03:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
and by the time joanna was eight weeks
 
03:43:41.030 --> 03:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
old she had it down and then
 
03:43:43.349 --> 03:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
four weeks later i had to return to work
 
03:43:45.030 --> 03:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
the transition was hard but it was
 
03:43:46.790 --> 03:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
possible because my employer made it
 
03:43:47.990 --> 03:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
very clear that
 
03:43:50.150 --> 03:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
my family came first and my work came
 
03:43:50.160 --> 03:43:51.349 align:start position:0%
my family came first and my work came
second

03:43:51.349 --> 03:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:43:53.750 --> 03:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
um similar to all of your days at the
 
03:43:55.349 --> 03:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
state house here you are going well into
 
03:43:56.790 --> 03:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
your lunch period my days were
 
03:43:56.800 --> 03:43:57.830 align:start position:0%

did get everybody this time
 
03:45:02.469 --> 03:45:02.479 align:start position:0%
few weeks okay so uh the senate bill 69
 
03:45:06.070 --> 03:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
had 130 supporters
 
03:45:09.189 --> 03:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
eight people were opposed and two were
 
03:45:11.910 --> 03:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
neutral and with that i will close the
 
03:45:15.349 --> 03:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
public hearing on senate bill 69
 
03:45:20.469 --> 03:45:20.479 align:start position:0%
and that is our day for today
 
03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
so for the committee members uh i'm not
 
03:45:25.349 --> 03:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
going to do anything for next tuesday
 
03:45:26.790 --> 03:45:26.800 align:start position:0%

03:45:28.790 --> 03:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
caucuses or some other
