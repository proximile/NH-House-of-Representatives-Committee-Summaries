an act making immunization status a

protected class
 
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.350 align:start position:0%
protected class
um

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
briefly i'm not going to go through
 
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh it line by line certainly
 
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.430 align:start position:0%
uh it line by line certainly
it's

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's a bill
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
to add to the protected class status
 
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
under the civil rights
 
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.070 align:start position:0%
under the civil rights
laws

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
which already have identified
 
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
protected classes such as age sex
 
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
gender identity race creed color marital
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
status familial status physical or
 
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
mental disability
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
or national origin and add to that
 
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
immunization status
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
such or vaccine status as
 
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
as it's more commonly known
 
00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:39.510 align:start position:0%
as it's more commonly known
um

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.189 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
a couple things it would expand uh i
 
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
believe that this is simply an expansion
 
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.189 align:start position:0%
believe that this is simply an expansion
of

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
what we already have identified as
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
physical and mental disability
 
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
and it would give the equal protect give
 
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.510 align:start position:0%
and it would give the equal protect give
the

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
protection under the law
 
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
i chose immunization status instead of
 
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
vaccine status because it's a broader
 
00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.870 align:start position:0%
vaccine status because it's a broader
definition

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
definition
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
which could it could imply uh
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine is is very limited and and
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
there's debate on what exactly you know
 
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
if the coveted vaccine is indeed a
 
00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.430 align:start position:0%
if the coveted vaccine is indeed a
vaccine

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
so this bill would imply
 
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.550 align:start position:0%
so this bill would imply
would

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
would protect
 
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.550 align:start position:0%
would protect
those

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
under employment laws housing laws
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
and public accommodation under those
 
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
it's rather straightforward so i don't
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
know that we need a huge discussion on
 
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.469 align:start position:0%
know that we need a huge discussion on
it

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
it would simply uh
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
the conversation about where what your
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
vaccine status is
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
while you're applying for a job or
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
what is a civil right i'm you're in
 
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
judiciary so i'm sure all of you are
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
very familiar with that
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
um it's the rights of citizens to
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
political and social freedom and
 
00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:07.110 align:start position:0%
political and social freedom and
equality

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
equality
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh civil rights are a class of rights
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
that protect individuals freedoms from
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
infringement by governments social
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
organizations and private individuals
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
a common argument against making
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
the vaccine status a protected class
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
is that unlike your gender or color
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
i would say that that is not entirely
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
true since
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
some physical disabilities
 
00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
a case can be made those can be
 
00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:38.630 align:start position:0%
a case can be made those can be
controlled

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
controlled
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
also gender identity
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a gray area
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
another argument against it would be
 
00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:46.070 align:start position:0%
another argument against it would be
that

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
you are
 
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.630 align:start position:0%
you are
expanding

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
expanding
 
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.910 align:start position:0%
expanding
government

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
so so to speak
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
in a broad way adding an additional
 
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.710 align:start position:0%
in a broad way adding an additional
regulation

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
i would say you know that's certainly
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
one way to look at it but that's
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
not the only way to look at it and
 
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
certainly civil rights
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
are important um
 
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
especially uh in this
 
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.590 align:start position:0%
especially uh in this
time

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
time and age when personal health
 
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.550 align:start position:0%
time and age when personal health
autonomy

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
autonomy
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
seems to be
 
00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:18.630 align:start position:0%
seems to be
a

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
growing concern
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
i think it's
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
probably going to be the concern of our
 
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.350 align:start position:0%
probably going to be the concern of our
age

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
age
 
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
and the next decade
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
so which side are are you all going to
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
be on
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
as far as this civil right
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
another argument in favor of this is
 
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.870 align:start position:0%
another argument in favor of this is
that

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.470 align:start position:0%
 
cutting

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
cutting
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
persons of color out of the job market
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
due to their vaccine status is yet
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
another infringement
 
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.030 align:start position:0%
another infringement
upon

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
upon
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
people of color
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
they have if you looked i
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
checked on our new hampshire
 
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.630 align:start position:0%
checked on our new hampshire
data

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
statistics on vaccines
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire last
 
00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:01.269 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire last
night

00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
night
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
and persons of color
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
and hispanics are by far the least
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinated people
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
in the state and that is uh
 
00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:11.509 align:start position:0%
in the state and that is uh
not

00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
special to our state but is
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
a phenomenon across the country
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
so what we have is a
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
another layer of protection for those
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
who already feel disenfranchised
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
by the government
 
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.630 align:start position:0%
by the government
um

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
that argument has been made in colorado
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
for the same bill
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
there are bills across the country
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
similar bills
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
it's already passed in montana this bill
 
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.069 align:start position:0%
it's already passed in montana this bill
protecting

00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.630 align:start position:0%
adding vaccination status as a protected

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
class
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
in colorado black community leaders came
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
forward to speak in favor of the bill
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
which would prohibit discrimination on
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
cove vaccine status they explain that
 
00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
the black and latino community is highly
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
vaccine hesitant due to the government's
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
history of medical atrocities against
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
them so i ask you to consider that and
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%

representative notter
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
taking the question what made you go
 
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.150 align:start position:0%
taking the question what made you go
with

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%

um this
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
this bill was something that
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
some individuals in the medical freedom
 
00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:40.310 align:start position:0%

caucus
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
decided that we would put up and um
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
i volunteered to
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
yes was there any talk about having a
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
bill for a conscientious objection
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
um i'm not quite
 
00:12:00.079 --> 00:12:01.670 align:start position:0%
um i'm not quite
sure

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
what you're referring to there are i
 
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
think there are
 
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
aren't there bills out there
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
that we're considering right now that
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
have to do with that
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
well that's what i was asking oh
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
i i don't i can't answer that that's
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry thank you
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
this is mainly driven by the covid 19
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.389 align:start position:0%
and the
mrna

00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
mrna
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
injection which is
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
put forward as
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
a solution
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
does that injection as far as you know
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
give you immunity to the disease or
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
it seems that there thank you for your
 
00:12:46.959 --> 00:12:47.829 align:start position:0%
it seems that there thank you for your
question

00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
representative it seems that there is
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
widespread evidence that it does not
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
provide any protection
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
from contracting the disease of covid
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:03.590 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
yes

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
first of all just let me clarify um
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
although you seem
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
we've already touched on that when you
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
answered representatives question which
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
is this
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
immunization status this would like uh
 
00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
apply to all vaccines not just the coven
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
19 but also like the many
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines that people were routinely
 
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.509 align:start position:0%
vaccines that people were routinely
taking

00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
taking
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
for years without what with relatively
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
as far as i read this
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative horrigan
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
it seems to imply that that it would be
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
applied to all immunizations as far as
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
again it's
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
pinpointed to employment
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
housing public housing and
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
laws pertaining to equal access
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
in housing status follow-up
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
you may yes
 
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.829 align:start position:0%
you may yes
um

00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned a uh
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
i guess you call it a civil right or
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
something called a natural right to
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
bodily integrity and
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
there's several
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
so the reason i'm going to go with that
 
00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:07.430 align:start position:0%
so the reason i'm going to go with that
is

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
does that give you a natural right to
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
spread a highly communicable respiratory
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
virus to other people around you
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
um i believe uh the recent supreme court
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh ruling
 
00:14:23.199 --> 00:14:23.990 align:start position:0%
uh ruling
it

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
pointed out that
 
00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:26.629 align:start position:0%
pointed out that
having

00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
viruses is a natural condition of
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
humanity it's a universal condition
 
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.629 align:start position:0%
humanity it's a universal condition
where

00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
that's our natural state it's not an
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
unnatural state to have a virus if
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's what you're getting getting at
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
not sure if that's what you mean
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
not really me understand viruses are
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's a lot we don't know about viruses
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
but they are everywhere and
 
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
most of them we've either are harmless
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
we've adapted to them but we do have
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
this one particular
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
kovid19 virus which is extremely deadly
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
it's killed um
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
going i'm going to say pretty close to a
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
million people in the united states and
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
even more worldwide so we have a
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
natural civil right to spread that
 
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um we have a
 
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
natural civil right to to remain as
 
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.629 align:start position:0%
natural civil right to to remain as
uh

00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
bodily intact
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
um and i believe that was uh
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
discussed at the last house session and
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
passed its law is that we have a right
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
to bodily integrity
 
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
in a right from
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
although this isn't directly government
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
intrusion but yes i i believe that we
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
have a right to bodily integrity and to
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
and conduct ourselves as we always have
 
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.550 align:start position:0%
and conduct ourselves as we always have
for

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
hundreds of years without
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
a myriad of
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
series of shots all
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay i guess so yeah i think
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
mr chair um
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
i i'm
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
really working hard to understand
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
your position and
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
respect your right to be here and
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
present this to us
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
are you saying that there is no
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
circumstance under which
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
the government has any right
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
to interfere with the bodily
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
um not not as such um i don't
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
i that is not what this bill says
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
only applies to
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
employment laws and the civil rights of
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
a person to remain bodily intact as they
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
always are naturally born
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
and not to be discriminated against when
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
when they are seeking housing
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
this would affect persons of color who
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
are seeking housing
 
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.909 align:start position:0%
are seeking housing
and

00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
who could be subjected to any number of
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
requirements for
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
shots which they may have reactions to
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
they may be pregnant
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
and and it's ill-advised that they get
 
00:17:17.679 --> 00:17:19.110 align:start position:0%
and and it's ill-advised that they get
shots

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
shots
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
this is something that should be
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
time has come
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
well thank you i won't belabor the issue
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
at what point should
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
people be presumed to be carrying
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
viruses that are extremely hazardous to
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
um at what point
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not a medical um
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
i some
 
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:08.310 align:start position:0%
i some
um

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
i i don't know how to answer that i'm
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
sorry do you have something to add to
 
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.430 align:start position:0%
sorry do you have something to add to
that

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.029 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
perhaps

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
should we
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
normally assume that everybody around us
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you maybe that um clarifies
 
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:29.990 align:start position:0%
okay thank you maybe that um clarifies
it

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.830 align:start position:0%
it
um

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
yes i i would say so i mean i agree with
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
that we are all potentially
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
carrying a disease at any time um
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
we have epidemiologists to help us
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
we have an epi epidemiologist in the
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
state we have public service
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
announcements and that this is how it's
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
always been for
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
for hundreds of years is is public
 
00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
service announcements education
 
00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.430 align:start position:0%
service announcements education
um

00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
doing doing the smart things and to
 
00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.350 align:start position:0%
doing doing the smart things and to
prevent

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.470 align:start position:0%
prevent
virus

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
virus
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh from spreading
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
um and i cannot speak to all the medical
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to turn this into a
 
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.950 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to turn this into a
medical

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
debate um
 
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.470 align:start position:0%
debate um
but

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
the more wide as far as i know and i'm
 
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
not a medical professional but the more
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
widespread a virus is
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
um the more
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
less the less lethal it is it seems um
 
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
from what i have researched with
 
00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.270 align:start position:0%
from what i have researched with
viruses

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
viruses
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
viruses uh for instance this one with
 
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.110 align:start position:0%
viruses uh for instance this one with
kovid

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
kovid
 
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like it started out more lethal
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
the more it spreads
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
the more it is
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
becomes uh less deadly because it has in
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
order to survive it it
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
it has to
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
become less lethal so it can
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
carry from one person to another
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
and again this i don't want to get into
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
a medical
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
if you're worried about a widespread
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
disease it's not as as lethal as say a
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
disease i think some of the earlier sars
 
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.710 align:start position:0%
disease i think some of the earlier sars
viruses

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
viruses
 
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
that happened
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
in the last decade were more deadly but
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
they burn out quickly because
 
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.549 align:start position:0%
they burn out quickly because
they

00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
they kill their hosts so um again i
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to get into the weeds with
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
that because i'm not all that
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:30.549 align:start position:0%
 
viruses

00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative simpson
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair if i may i'm a little anxious
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
that we're broadcasting publicly to the
 
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire and there is
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
some misinformation that
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
actually is not what our epidemiologists
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
of the state are telling us is being
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
shared over the world wide web just want
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
to register that thank you
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comment
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
are there other questions representative
 
00:20:54.159 --> 00:20:55.430 align:start position:0%
are there other questions representative
lorenzo

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
lorenzo
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
could you please expand on your
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
statements that physical disabilities
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
sure thank you representative dilorenzo
 
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.789 align:start position:0%
sure thank you representative dilorenzo
um

00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
i i think i said
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
that some physical disabilities
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
could be considered as something that
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
could be controlled
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
such as an overweight
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
possibly neglected their health
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
some of the the conditions that would
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
render a person
 
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.549 align:start position:0%
render a person
physically

00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
physically
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
to give them a physical disability
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
could pot could have a medical
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
professional would say that they could
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
have controlled those or prevented them
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
in some cases
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
does that clear that follow-up yes you
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
may follow up okay so when i think about
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
um physical disability i look at the
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
social security definition of disability
 
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.630 align:start position:0%
social security definition of disability
and

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
the qualifications for disability under
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
social security is that a person is is
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
sick they're unable to work the
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
condition is
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
could result in death um
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
and so i
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
i think there's sort of like a um
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
kind of a mismatch between what you're
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
defining as disability and what the
 
00:22:28.159 --> 00:22:29.909 align:start position:0%
defining as disability and what the
legal

00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
definition of disability is
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
i guess i do i have a question okay and
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
and that is uh talking about
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
immunization status
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
right now our schools require certain
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
immunizations for children in order to
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
attend public schools and the supreme
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
court has upheld that in the past
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
as something that they're entitled to do
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
would if we put this into
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:10.159 --> 00:23:11.190 align:start position:0%
 
does

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
would this
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
apply in any way or would affect
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
status um
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
i believe that um
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
that it is possible that uh
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
that this would affect
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
possibly schools um
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
in the same way that
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
gender identity
 
00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:44.950 align:start position:0%
gender identity
may

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
impact schools and protecting that civil
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.039 --> 00:23:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.750 align:start position:0%
but
uh

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's remains to be seen how that would
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
go uh the schools might be separate
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
and they already have laws so
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
thank you and if i could just follow up
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
and this is the problem of being a
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
lawyer because
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
words are the
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
tools of the lawyers trade but
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
it mentions immunization immunization
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
statute and when you were saying you
 
00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:21.430 align:start position:0%
statute and when you were saying you
said

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
currently the vaccine that is provided
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
for covid
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
may not provide immunization
 
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.350 align:start position:0%
may not provide immunization
so

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
if that's the case if it doesn't provide
 
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.269 align:start position:0%
if that's the case if it doesn't provide
immunization

00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
immunization
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question maybe um
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
it that's why it was written broadly mr
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
chair immunization status
 
00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:53.990 align:start position:0%
chair immunization status
meaning

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
you could have immunity
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
from um simply having coveted
 
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.390 align:start position:0%
from um simply having coveted
um

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
but that you know
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
and that's certainly a consideration
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
you've you've had covet so you have some
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
immunity but that's not
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
how this is uh working out for people so
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
they're not uh being allowed to
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh use their their immunity that they've
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
had from a past infection to their
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
credit um and avoid
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
getting a vaccine
 
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.350 align:start position:0%
getting a vaccine
um

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
it is it's it's
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's simply an intellectual um
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
you believe that that it is a civil
 
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.990 align:start position:0%
you believe that that it is a civil
right

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
that needs protecting
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
um and and i think that it comes down to
 
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.230 align:start position:0%
um and and i think that it comes down to
that

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.029 align:start position:0%
 
would

00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
and just as a follow-up to that question
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
is would it not be better to say
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination status as opposed to
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
if if i i would certainly be
 
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
um open to an amendment if the committee
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
felt that that was
 
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.310 align:start position:0%
felt that that was
appropriate

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
i was simply thinking of
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
the coveted vaccine in it
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
as it is
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
it's an mrna
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
some some say it's an mrna
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
medical uh
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
device or
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a treatment but it's
 
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
technically not a vaccine so i was
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
simply thinking of future
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
it's not exactly a vaccine that you're
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
that there that say the government is
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
asking you to get
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
but it is
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
a gene therapy sort of
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
treatment that they're asking you to get
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of
 
00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:06.549 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of
viruses

00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
viruses
 
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
to prevent viruses
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
so i was that's why i was thinking in
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
broad strokes about um
 
00:27:13.039 --> 00:27:14.630 align:start position:0%
broad strokes about um
this

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
immunization status
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
because it's possible that in the future
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
it's they won't even call it a vaccine
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps but they'll call it you know
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
what it what what other people have
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
called it is mrna treatment or
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
other medical treatments
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
and and i guess an argument can also be
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
made that it could be
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
medical treatments
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
if i could just follow up one last time
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
could this not backfire in some cases
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm just thinking of
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
a noted tennis player where
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
you have a rule that says that you have
 
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.029 align:start position:0%
you have a rule that says that you have
to

00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
you have to
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
comply with certain requirements
 
00:28:05.919 --> 00:28:06.789 align:start position:0%
comply with certain requirements
but

00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
if you already have immunity because
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
you've had the disease
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
that couldn't your immunity status
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't be taken into consideration so
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
you'd still have to comply like
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
if you had a law that said you had to
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
wear a mask
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
but you've already had the disease and
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
you're immune
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
this would say you can't take that
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
immunity statute into consideration that
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
immunity into consideration and
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
determining whether you have to wear a
 
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:38.549 align:start position:0%
determining whether you have to wear a
mask

00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
any number of issues could be
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
just like the other
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question other
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
categories here
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
age sex gender you know and all of those
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
any number of those could
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
backfire in any sort of
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
certain ways
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
i can imagine um
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
the gender identity there's this fraught
 
00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:05.350 align:start position:0%
the gender identity there's this fraught
with

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
all kinds of complications
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
um and so i guess
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
that's why i didn't go into a
 
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.149 align:start position:0%
that's why i didn't go into a
it

00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
in you know an intense testimony because
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
it just sort of comes down to is it
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
a right that should be protected or not
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's simple and do we want to
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
have make these cutouts and protect
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
people who don't want
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
medical um treatments and or vaccines
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
um or or do we not see it as something
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
representative silvia
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and you inspired some
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
questions for me uh the first one having
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
to do with uh school children and
 
00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:56.789 align:start position:0%
to do with uh school children and
discrimination

00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh do you
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
would it be your understanding that
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
currently children are
 
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.510 align:start position:0%
currently children are
essentially

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
put into various classes by the age
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
group and
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
some are discriminated against
 
00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.149 align:start position:0%
some are discriminated against
perhaps

00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
representative so the question is are
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
some children discriminated against
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
due to age
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what you're getting at with
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
are you trying to say that
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
discrimination is is sort of normal in
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
schools because age is
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
a category and how we categorize
 
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.990 align:start position:0%
a category and how we categorize
children

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.070 align:start position:0%
children
um

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say they're discriminated
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
against no they're
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say it's a discrimination
 
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.789 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say it's a discrimination
um

00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
or a civil rights violation that the
 
00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.470 align:start position:0%
or a civil rights violation that the
children

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.509 align:start position:0%
children
are

00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
categorized by age in school
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up so i guess the the the the
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
point of that question is
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
or let me rephrase the question
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
so that it is a question
 
00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:16.710 align:start position:0%
so that it is a question
um

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
do you know of
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
the possibility that children can
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh file a suit because of discrimination
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
on on the basis of age if they feel they
 
00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.190 align:start position:0%
on on the basis of age if they feel they
are

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
discriminated against
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
would this apply
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
differently because of age or vaccines
 
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.350 align:start position:0%
differently because of age or vaccines
vaccine

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
immunization status
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sylvia i do not
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
know of any
 
00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.990 align:start position:0%
know of any
lawsuits

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
lawsuits
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
per se
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
that top
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
where the age is the subject matter
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh as a basis of a discrimination
 
00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.149 align:start position:0%
uh as a basis of a discrimination
lawsuit

00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
although i
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
i i can recall in
 
00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.110 align:start position:0%
i i can recall in
in

00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
that it has come up in the past
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
um i
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
where a student with
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
extraordinary you know abilities in
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
school wanted to
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know for instance skip grades or or
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
whatnot and they
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
weren't allowed
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
but i can't say i know of any specific
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative nader thank you mr
 
00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.710 align:start position:0%
representative nader thank you mr
chairman

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
representative the chairman had
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned that shots are required for
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
children to go to school would you
 
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
believe that we have
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
in the law a religious exemption but we
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
do not have conscientious objection and
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
that's why i
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
asked about that earlier today
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative knotter i i i
 
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
do know that's a
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
um something that is
 
00:32:48.799 --> 00:32:49.669 align:start position:0%
um something that is
uh

00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
that we're just you know that we're
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
discussing right now at the house level
 
00:32:53.679 --> 00:32:56.549 align:start position:0%
discussing right now at the house level
too

00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
that is something that did not come up
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
when we were writing this bill but i
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
my additional question
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
earlier it was suggested that we might
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
change this to vaccine status as opposed
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
to immunization status
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
are you aware
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
that the cdc has
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
changed the definition of vaccine over
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
the years
 
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sylvia i
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
i was aware
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
and i had heard that the cdc had changed
 
00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:35.750 align:start position:0%
and i had heard that the cdc had changed
it

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
it makes it difficult
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
chair i um
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
i hesitate because i think it
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
might be time to
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
permit the sponsor to
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
retire to another seat and let other
 
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
people come but
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
um i have
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
as the first staff member
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
of the equal employment opportunity
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
commission which was created title vii
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%

of the civil rights act of 64.
uh

00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:21.510 align:start position:0%
uh
and

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
being somewhat aware of
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
the definitions of civil rights
 
00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:30.389 align:start position:0%
the definitions of civil rights
and

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
how they have evolved over the years in
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
this country
 
00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.829 align:start position:0%
this country
i'm

00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
stumbling a little bit to
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
try to understand
 
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.950 align:start position:0%
try to understand
how

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
this issue fits in
 
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
to a civil right
 
00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:49.990 align:start position:0%
to a civil right
but

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
let me follow up on one of the questions
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
that one of my colleagues asked
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
do you think it would be
 
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.829 align:start position:0%
do you think it would be
a

00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:35:00.839 --> 00:35:02.470 align:start position:0%
a
legitimate

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
case if
 
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.349 align:start position:0%
case if
um

00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:05.359 --> 00:35:07.030 align:start position:0%
um
someone

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
representing the interests of a
 
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.750 align:start position:0%
representing the interests of a
three-year-old

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
three-year-old
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
since i think we all recognize that the
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
three-year-old could not represent her
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
own interest
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
but someone representing the interests
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
of a three-year-old
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
could sue
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
the government
 
00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.589 align:start position:0%
the government
for

00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:28.630 align:start position:0%
for
under

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
current conditions not
 
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.790 align:start position:0%
current conditions not
permitting

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
the three-year-old to be vaccinated
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
on the government's theory that there is
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
not yet appropriate verifiable evidence
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
that that would be the safest thing for
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
that child
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
would that
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
case have standing
 
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
because that child's civil rights are
 
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.270 align:start position:0%
because that child's civil rights are
being

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
denied and that that child's
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative can't
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
insist on
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination or immunization whichever
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
representative i'm not sure if i fully
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
unders let me repeat back
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
would i think that there's a problem if
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
there was somebody representing a
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
three-year-old who didn't want it the
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
three-year-old didn't want to get
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or the parent i'm sorry the
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
three-year-old the representative who
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
has standing in the court to the parent
 
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
of the caregiver or whomever
 
00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
did want the child to be
 
00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinated but in fact no
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
responsible medical provider
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
would provide
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
that vaccination or immunization until
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
such time
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
as the appropriate government agencies
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
say it would be safe for a
 
00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.150 align:start position:0%
say it would be safe for a
three-year-old

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
three-year-old
 
00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.030 align:start position:0%
three-year-old
and

00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
but the uh the person responsible wants
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
to jump the gun and say i want my i want
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
this civil right to be honored and have
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
this child vaccinated
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
the government would say no
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
right now six weeks from now they might
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
say yes as new research and testing
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrates that it is safe for very
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
young children but right now it's not
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
but someone believes their civil rights
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
are being
 
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.839 --> 00:37:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
you when when you build a wall you have
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
to figure out what you built what you're
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
walling in and what you're walling out
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
and you're looking at it from the point
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
of view of no vaccination but it's what
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
about the other side
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
of someone who wants a vaccination okay
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
i think i understand the question
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative but
 
00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.990 align:start position:0%
representative but
um

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
this isn't
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
this isn't really about forcing vaccines
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
or or taking
 
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.349 align:start position:0%
or or taking
vaccines

00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
and the in the particulars about
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
when they should be administered or if
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
they should be administered to a child
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
or the medical advice as it changes
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
constantly with regard to covid and
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
you know now we're looking at them
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
possibly vaccinated children that are
 
00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:30.069 align:start position:0%
possibly vaccinated children that are
five

00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
um for the code vaccine but it is
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
really more of a theoretical
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
argument a civil war is it a civil right
 
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
or should it be a civil right
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
people should have equal protections
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
under the law
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
to remain as they are
 
00:38:49.839 --> 00:38:51.430 align:start position:0%
to remain as they are
unvaccinated

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated
 
00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.589 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated
um

00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
and under
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
and and given these protections it's
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
theoretical and it's not
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
there we could probably
 
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
do these
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
special you know what what ifs all day
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
but it's it's more i think
 
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.710 align:start position:0%
but it's it's more i think
theoretical

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
theoretical
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
um certainly there's a case to be made
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
for we can discuss what ifs quite quite
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
a bit and i could probably take gobble
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
up quite a bit of your time but
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
the way i see it
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
when i wrote this and thought of it is
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
it is not much different than a physical
 
00:39:27.359 --> 00:39:28.630 align:start position:0%
it is not much different than a physical
disability

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
disability
 
00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.430 align:start position:0%
disability
or

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
a choice such as
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
gender which you could construe gender
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
identity could be you know some people
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
choose to be this or
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
they feel that they are another gender
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
or marital status is also a choice
 
00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.510 align:start position:0%
or marital status is also a choice
um

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.069 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna leave it at that
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for your
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.829 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:10.550 align:start position:0%
we
have

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
sorry are we on
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
my name is kathy bizarothemberg
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
executive vice president with the new
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital association
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
representing all 26 of our state's
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
community hospitals as well as all of
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
our specialty hospitals
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire hospital association
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
is opposed to house bill 1260. the bill
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
before you
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
would make immunization status a
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
protected class
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
we do not believe it's appropriate to
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
include immunization status as a
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
protected class under the state
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
constitution of human rights
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
this committee heard a similar bill last
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
week house bill 1519 which we also
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
testified in opposition
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
this bill as well as other bills before
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
this committee attempts to insert
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
additional classes into the statute that
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
protects individuals from discrimination
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
which is not appropriate
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
we believe all these bills are focused
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
on without explicitly stating such an
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
attempt to insert vague language into
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
the statute against the covet 19 vaccine
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
the result of all these bills would just
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
lead to lawsuits and further confusion
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
among employers and employees
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's our position that employers have
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
the right to determine what is best for
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
their employees and their clients their
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
patients and or their patrons
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
requiring vaccinations of healthcare
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
workers from communicable diseases is
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
not new for our hospitals in new
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospitals have required
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
vaccination against several communicable
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
and deadly diseases such as mumps
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
measles rubella chickenpox diphtheria
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
tetanus pertussis and influenza as a
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
condition of employment with the same
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
type of medical and religious exemptions
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
allowed for the covit 19 vaccine
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
we believe requiring vaccinations is
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely the right thing to do for the
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
health and safety of our patients our
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
staff and the citizens of new hampshire
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of hospital staff have
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated against coven 19 or have
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
received exemptions and we've heard from
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
many health care workers who support the
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirement to protect their
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
health and that of their patients that
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
they're caring for
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion we are opposed to house
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
bill 1260 and we urge this committee to
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
find the bill in expedient to legislate
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the opportunity
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
to present our testimony
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
are there questions
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
just last night we had a conversation
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
with our county
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
nursing home administrator
 
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
who told us that
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
with the possibility that
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
a third injection would be possibly
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
mandated by cms
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
that 60 percent of the staff would not
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
take it
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
d do you see that as a threat to the
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
medical system
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
for our hospitals experience we have not
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
seen that number at all i'm not sure
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
what his experience his or her
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
experiences with that particular nursing
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
home and their staff
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
we have found that
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of our hospital staff
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
have taken the vaccine as a mandate and
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
has not had a major impact on
 
00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.510 align:start position:0%
has not had a major impact on
their

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.270 align:start position:0%
their
employment

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.069 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.079 --> 00:43:49.349 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
would you say that staffing levels have
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
not been affected by those who are
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
resisting the injection
 
00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
right now all of our hospitals have gone
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
through the process of mandating the
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
vaccine we have seen a very small number
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
of individuals who decided to
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
remove themselves from employment from
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
our hospitals we have had
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
even before the pandemic
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
nursing shortages so
 
00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.190 align:start position:0%
nursing shortages so
we

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
risk of requiring vaccines for
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers but again the vast
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
vast majority have taken the vaccine
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
yes too i'm also on a county
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
county delegation executive committee
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
and this topic came up
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
in stratford county and what
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
what we were told was that there's near
 
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.510 align:start position:0%
what we were told was that there's near
100

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate amongst the staff at
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
the rest home and also
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
amongst amongst the patients who are
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
healthy enough to go through it so is
 
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
your experience is traffic county more
 
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
typical or is belknap county where we're
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
just told supposedly 60 of the staff are
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
refusing to get vaccinated or is it
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
so is it
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
where is it in between those two
 
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.510 align:start position:0%
where is it in between those two
extremes

00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
extremes
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
yeah right
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
is there a question specifically related
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
yes which which of those
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
two data points have been cited as as to
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
the representative
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
misrepresented my remarks
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
i said that our
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
nursing home administrator said that if
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
a third injection is required
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
her opinion is that 60 percent of the
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
staff will not take it i did not say
 
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
that 60 had not taken it
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
i apologize if it didn't make myself
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
clear but i was also
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
we also heard that there is little of
 
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
any resistance amongst the staff so um
 
00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:53.589 align:start position:0%
any resistance amongst the staff so um
maybe

00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's two different homes two different
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
committees so i think you've made your
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
point so thank you
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
there any other questions representative
 
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.270 align:start position:0%
there any other questions representative
lorenzo

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
lorenzo
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question now um if this bill
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
were to pass would it affect payments
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
from medicare
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
i think there are other bills that have
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
a more direct impact on
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
the federal requirements for mandates
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
for health care workers to receive
 
00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:27.750 align:start position:0%
for health care workers to receive
the

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
cobin 19 vaccine
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer to understand if this
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
particular bill would have
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
a direct impact on their federal
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursements however i think
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
we have a serious concern with
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
trying to insert immunization status as
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
a protected class because
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
we as a healthcare profession or
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
healthcare industry are requiring

other questions you have another
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
question representative sylvia
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
yeah so what you're saying
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
if i can
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
ask this
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
you are currently discriminating against
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
people who have a natural
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
immune system
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry um representative but that is
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
incorrect um
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
copenhagen 19
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
vaccination is a requirement for
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
employment it has nothing to do with
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
natural immunity from someone who has
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
received who has contracted coping 19
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
and in fact we highly encourage those
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
who have contracted copenhagen to still
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%

committee
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
i see this i'm in support of this bill i
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
see this bill as uh protecting civil
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
rights because of the amount of
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
discrimination that
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
occurs for people who have chosen not to
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
take the vaccine
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
i consider this
 
00:48:38.319 --> 00:48:39.829 align:start position:0%
i consider this
personal

00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
protected medical information
 
00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:44.950 align:start position:0%
protected medical information
that

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
we should not have to share with other
 
00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:48.870 align:start position:0%
we should not have to share with other
people

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
if i were to take a survey
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
around the room here and
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
ask people although i meant policy would
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
say that i shouldn't ask questions but
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
if i were to ask people to raise their
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
hands around the table
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
to share their medical information with
 
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.710 align:start position:0%
to share their medical information with
me

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
i would ask questions like um have you
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you've been treated
 
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.349 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you've been treated
for

00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
std or
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you've had your tubes
 
00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.829 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you've had your tubes
tied

00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
tied
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you have cancer
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you've
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
been treated for mental illness
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
imagine now that
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
a school teacher is in a room of
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
elementary students and
 
00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
is asking
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
the children
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you're not vaccinated
 
00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.630 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you're not vaccinated
imagine

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.750 align:start position:0%
imagine
the

the
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
kids who are not vaccinated because of
 
00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.910 align:start position:0%
kids who are not vaccinated because of
choice

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
by now we're going to be
 
00:49:53.359 --> 00:49:56.710 align:start position:0%
by now we're going to be
discriminated

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
recall the famous
 
00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.750 align:start position:0%

students and the blue eyed students
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
this is a discrimination
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
how did we get there how did we get here
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
day where we're trying to consider
 
00:50:13.599 --> 00:50:14.950 align:start position:0%

vaccine

emotion it disarms people

imagined the center for disease control
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
you would think they would have hundreds
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
of clinical trials across the country
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%

when this broke out
no

00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
no we're not going to try to treat this
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
acutely we'll just wait till people get
 
00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.510 align:start position:0%
acutely we'll just wait till people get
sick

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
sick
 
00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:48.309 align:start position:0%
sick
and

00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
go to the hospital get on a ventilator
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
and see how they do
 
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
but we have hope we have a vaccine the
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
only hope is a vaccine and this was
 
00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.390 align:start position:0%
only hope is a vaccine and this was
touted

00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
touted
 
00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.910 align:start position:0%
touted
forever

00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
forever
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
got to get a vaccine our only hope out
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
but it's going to take a couple years
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
because historically vaccines have to go
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
through a huge process of
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
safe trials safety trials and other
 
00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.549 align:start position:0%
safe trials safety trials and other
trials

00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
trials
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
oh but look
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
suddenly we have a vaccine after a year
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
this experimental vaccine emergency use
 
00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.950 align:start position:0%
this experimental vaccine emergency use
authorization

00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
well even though the safety data wasn't
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
there let's let's
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
because we need to allay the fear let's
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
get this vaccine out
 
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
then the vaccine came out people were
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
signing up left and right
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
people couldn't wait to get their
 
00:52:54.319 --> 00:52:55.510 align:start position:0%
people couldn't wait to get their
vaccine

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
i want to be first in line
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be late for my appointment
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
because i have to call to get my vaccine
 
00:53:01.359 --> 00:53:04.710 align:start position:0%
because i have to call to get my vaccine

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:07.670 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
some people feel it's their right their
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
human right not to have things injected
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
into their body especially for something
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
that has not been proven to be
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
safe and effective and i say that and
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
sharing misinformation which is a
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
convenient phrase to cancel people
 
00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.790 align:start position:0%
convenient phrase to cancel people
but

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
the cdc's own vares reporting system has
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
reported over
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand deaths thought to be due
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
to the vaccine
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
this number is probably underestimated
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
in the same way that the original deaths
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
so now we have this
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
vaccine status which is the holy grail
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
everyone wants to be vaccined and we
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to be around people that are
 
00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:03.270 align:start position:0%
don't want to be around people that are
unvaccinated

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
i just share some stories of my own
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
every year i lead a kayaking trip with a
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
bunch of people
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
and we fill out a spreadsheet
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
include what you're going to bring for
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
potluck what sort of community items
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to bring for the trip
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
and everyone on the trip can i can edit
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet is blank and i'm still
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
waiting for people to add their
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
information to the spreadsheet and
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
suddenly someone writes down
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
a column vaccine status
 
00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:48.950 align:start position:0%
a column vaccine status
and

00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
bing bang that thing gets filled up
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
and i said to someone say you know we
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
don't we don't need to share that
 
00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.390 align:start position:0%
don't we don't need to share that
information

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine status
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
oh yes i have a right to know if you're
 
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.950 align:start position:0%
oh yes i have a right to know if you're
vaccinated

00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
i've had my vaccine and i need to know
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
if anyone else
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
is unvaccinated
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
why do you need to know that if you
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
believe in the vaccine you took the
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine do you really what are you
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
afraid of are you
 
00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:24.650 align:start position:0%
like i'm going to infect you because um
 
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:26.430 align:start position:0%
like i'm going to infect you because um
[Music]

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated and considered someone
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
maybe like i had leprosy or some such
 
00:55:31.599 --> 00:55:34.069 align:start position:0%
maybe like i had leprosy or some such
thing

00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh another instance is my wife wanted to
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
have a long-term knitting friend over
 
00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:45.990 align:start position:0%
have a long-term knitting friend over
and

00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
we would
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
she would sit in the driveway
 
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.270 align:start position:0%
she would sit in the driveway
spread

00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
spread
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
10 feet apart
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
the woman
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
emailed her and said to her i'm sorry
 
00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.789 align:start position:0%
emailed her and said to her i'm sorry
but

00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:02.799 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
i hear that you're unvaccinated and i
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
really can't come to your house and knit
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
so i consider uh this
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
bill as something that we're seeing
 
00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.990 align:start position:0%
bill as something that we're seeing
discrimination

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
with people who are unvaccinated not i'd
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
like to just add another example that um
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
is a local one a local business
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
is allowing people who are vaccinated
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
come to their venue on thursday nights
 
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
but only if you bring your vaccine
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
passport which is another whole
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
legislative issue
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
when you come on thursday we'll even
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
serve food to you
 
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
but if you come on friday or monday now
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
you can't have our food
 
00:56:59.670 --> 00:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
so i see this as a discriminatory
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
class of people that we're ending up
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
with the so-called unvaxed the dangerous
 
00:57:04.559 --> 00:57:05.510 align:start position:0%
with the so-called unvaxed the dangerous
bugaboo

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
bugaboo
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
people that we have to be wary of
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony um
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
it sounds like to me that you may be or
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with dr mark mcdonald
 
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
mark mcdonald no
 
00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:33.030 align:start position:0%
mark mcdonald no
okay

00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
may i ask who that is or why the
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
question or i can't
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
can't do that unfortunately we get that
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%

good morning everyone my name is ani
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
malachi i am the executive director for
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
the human rights commission
 
00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:24.870 align:start position:0%
the human rights commission
and

00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:25.910 align:start position:0%
and
my

00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
testimony today is more informational
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
than anything i'm certainly
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
open to any questions that you all might
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
have for me
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
we the commission is not taking a
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
position on hb 1260 um but uh
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
i'm here for any any questions you might
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
have i've listened to the previous
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
testimony maybe i can shed light there
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
may be some issues where i cannot but
 
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
i'll certainly do my very best
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
one of the things i would like to say
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
before i turn it over to you all for
 
00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:58.230 align:start position:0%
before i turn it over to you all for
questions

00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
when we looked over the legislation
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
there were questions for
 
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:05.990 align:start position:0%
there were questions for
us

00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
relative to the definition where it
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
talks about immunization status
 
00:59:14.069 --> 00:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
in that definition it talks about
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
employment specifically however our
 
00:59:16.799 --> 00:59:19.270 align:start position:0%
employment specifically however our
statute

00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
and and further on in in house bill 1260
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
it does include
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
public accommodation and
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
housing however the definition is very
 
00:59:30.319 --> 00:59:31.589 align:start position:0%
housing however the definition is very
specific

00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
to employment only
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
i think someone asked earlier relative
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
to education and as of 2019 the
 
00:59:40.559 --> 00:59:41.589 align:start position:0%
to education and as of 2019 the
commission

00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
also covers k-12 public education
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
think this would possibly apply to that
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
but maybe there's an amendment to to fix
 
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:54.870 align:start position:0%
but maybe there's an amendment to to fix
the

00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.150 align:start position:0%
the
the

00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
that portion of the
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
of the definition that only speaks to
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
employment however the rest of the the
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
bill speaks to at least two of the other
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
areas that we currently cover
 
01:00:07.599 --> 01:00:08.789 align:start position:0%
areas that we currently cover
um

01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:08.799 --> 01:00:10.069 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
with that said if there are any
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
questions for ms malachi
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
broadly speaking
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's the commission on human rights and
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
then it also speaks of civil rights
 
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
could you just clarify for us
 
01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.910 align:start position:0%
could you just clarify for us
the

01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
difference if there are any uh between
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
the two terms
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for your question
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
um i've been the executive director for
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
about four years i have that question
 
01:00:45.599 --> 01:00:46.789 align:start position:0%
about four years i have that question
daily

01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
daily
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
we get lots of calls from lots of people
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
and so the title of the organization is
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
the commission for human rights however
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
what we do is we enforce
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
rsa 354-a which is based upon the
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
title vii of the civil rights act
 
01:01:04.079 --> 01:01:04.870 align:start position:0%
title vii of the civil rights act
so

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
the naming of the organization is a
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
little confusing but you would have to
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
those that preceded me and created this
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
have there been any
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
complaints brought against employers who
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
are discriminating against people who
 
01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.309 align:start position:0%
are discriminating against people who
have

01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
a natural
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
immune system that they believe they
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the question um so
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
we have really strict confidentiality um
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
within our agency um what i would need
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
to do is circle back with you to tell
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
you statistically speaking if we have
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
had any charges
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
but the way the law is written right now
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
people can
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
exert a religious or medical exemption
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
so those are the areas of which that
 
01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
people have a right to to make to assert
 
01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.230 align:start position:0%
people have a right to to make to assert
their

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
freedom i i guess if you want to say it
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
since immunization status is not
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
something that we currently cover then
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have any charges there
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
have people called about that i would
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
have to look to see if there have been
 
01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
and then really
 
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
look at the rule to make sure that i
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
could share that information publicly
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
but the the long answer to the short
 
01:02:39.599 --> 01:02:40.630 align:start position:0%
but the the long answer to the short
question

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
we do not currently cover immunization
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
status so
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
there would not be any statistical
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
information relative to immunization
 
01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.710 align:start position:0%
information relative to immunization
status

01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia would you like to
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'll uh i'll let the chairman know that
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
he should have his gavel handy for this
 
01:02:57.119 --> 01:03:02.470 align:start position:0%
he should have his gavel handy for this
question

01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
some people
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
would consider
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
not being vaccinated as a mental
 
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.029 align:start position:0%
not being vaccinated as a mental
disability

01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
disability
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.710 align:start position:0%
would that be
protected

01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
protected
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
by your agency
 
01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.069 align:start position:0%
by your agency
so

01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
being thank you for the question um
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
being discriminated against based on
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
your mental or physical disability is
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
something that we would cover
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
we look to the ada so
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
if if there was a question there we have
 
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
whatever legal precedent provided to us
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
by the if it's in employment um the eeoc
 
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
who we partner with is our federal
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
partner we certainly have the ada to
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
look at and if there's nothing there and
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
we have additional questions then we
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
would certainly refer those questions to
 
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office whose job
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
it is to interpret the statutes as as
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
they are so written for the state of new
 
01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.630 align:start position:0%
they are so written for the state of new
hampshire

01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
i guess the only question i have is uh
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
this being added to the statute
 
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
being immunization status
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
do you see
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
is this would this be viewed any
 
01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:19.039 align:start position:0%
differently than any of the other
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
categories that are in the statute do
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
you see any issues or problems with
 
01:04:23.599 --> 01:04:24.950 align:start position:0%
you see any issues or problems with
enforcement

01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that's a great
 
01:04:26.319 --> 01:04:27.670 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that's a great
question

01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
we would cover this as we do as we would
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
anything else that's currently written
 
01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:32.799 align:start position:0%
in our statute
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
the question would then move forward in
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
terms of volume
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
because if you're looking at
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
immunization status this is broadly
 
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.910 align:start position:0%
immunization status this is broadly
written

01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
and so it could cover anything any
 
01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.470 align:start position:0%
and so it could cover anything any
immunization

01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
immunization
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
it would cover k-12 education it would
 
01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:49.910 align:start position:0%
it would cover k-12 education it would
cover

01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
cover
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
people relative to their employment or
 
01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
housing or being able to or not able to
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
walk into a venue or a store
 
01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.589 align:start position:0%
walk into a venue or a store
so

01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
there could be a possibility that we
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
would have a lot of charges walk through
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
the door
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
and we could also not have very many
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
charges walk through the door
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that would be very
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
difficult at this point to to ascertain
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
what the
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
if there would be a tsunami
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
or if there would be
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
very very few charges and
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh and and so to answer your question
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
more specifically
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
yes we would handle these the way we
 
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
would age race sex gender any of the
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
areas of uh discriminate discrimination
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
and i just sort of want you you've
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
provoked another question by your
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
response and and that is
 
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
not to be pejorative but some delay in
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
the way cases have been processed people
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
have complained at times about how long
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
it takes to process through the human
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
rights commission
 
01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:03.270 align:start position:0%
rights commission
and

01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
given that this is an issue which might
 
01:06:11.789 --> 01:06:11.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
is there an issue at all with regard to
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
the handling the volume of potential
 
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
claims thank you very much for the
 
01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
question and the opportunity to share
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
some breaking news as it were
 
01:06:24.319 --> 01:06:25.349 align:start position:0%
some breaking news as it were
so

01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
with the number of investigators that we
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
have which is five
 
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
and we cover the entire state is that
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
number something that should be
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
increased absolutely do all agencies ask
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
for increase in staff of course they do
 
01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:39.750 align:start position:0%
for increase in staff of course they do
however

01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
for the process that we follow
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
having more hands is immensely helpful
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
since becoming the director of the
 
01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.950 align:start position:0%
since becoming the director of the
agency

01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
more recently i have looked at how we
 
01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
are staffed and what staff is doing what
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
so with this last budget cycle added a
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
paralegal which has been
 
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is just a part-time
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
position however it has been immensely
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
helpful with shifting some of the burden
 
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
that would have fallen to certain
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
investigators and or the assistant
 
01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.910 align:start position:0%
investigators and or the assistant
director

01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
to work on motions for reconsideration
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
and other of our more legal elements so
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
it has shifted that burden um and it is
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
working very well
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
along with that um the staff the
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
assistant director myself and our staff
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
along with our
 
01:07:30.799 --> 01:07:31.589 align:start position:0%
along with our
help

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
from the ag's office our client services
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
representative went through a very long
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
process of working together to change
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
how we are processing our cases to
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
create a more efficient process
 
01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
it obviously follows the statute and it
 
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
follows the rules but looking at
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
timelines and looking at how we can
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
shore up what we're doing and how to
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
make the process move faster for
 
01:07:59.829 --> 01:07:59.839 align:start position:0%
complainants as well as respondents you
 
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
know when a respondent gets a letter
 
01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
they would like to move through this
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
process as quickly as they can
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
and when a complainant files a charge
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
they would certainly like to have the
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have their
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
their voice heard and if their financial
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
if there's financial compensation that's
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
needed they would certainly like to have
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
that in a much faster form
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things that had happened over
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
time with the agency is there was some
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
turnover so
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
see some people were leaving to seek
 
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
other employment to do something
 
01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
completely different there were
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
attorneys or new attorneys young
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
attorneys who had young meaning length
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
of time practice not age
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
were not discriminating here
 
01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:43.669 align:start position:0%
were not discriminating here
but

01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
attorneys who were new in their legal
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
career who could not afford to continue
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
to work for the agency with school loans
 
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
etcetera and so what happens is when
 
01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:57.030 align:start position:0%
etcetera and so what happens is when
each

01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
each
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
investigator has a caseload and any
 
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
investigator for whatever reason is no
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
longer employed with the agency their
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
caseload moves over and it's divided
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
amongst the other
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
investigators that are remaining so they
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
have their current caseload whatever
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
additional cases that were given and
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
currently uh or previously the case load
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
was set at 50
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
which is not a sustainable or workable
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
model and so we have revamped that as
 
01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:24.709 align:start position:0%
model and so we have revamped that as
well

01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
so they're going through all of their 50
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
cases plus the others that they were
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
assigned and then when those get done
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
then you start going into the cases that
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
have been
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
that have come in and so what we're
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
looking at is really restructuring how
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
many cases are assigned initially
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
looking at the timelines that are given
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
and there's a letter that will go to the
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
bar to explain what this process is and
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
to prepare them for things to move a lot
 
01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:55.910 align:start position:0%
to prepare them for things to move a lot
faster

01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
faster
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
to avoid the opportunity for
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
cases to sort of sit with us until
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
certain practitioners are ready to move
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
them forward but all of this is in the
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
name of the agency working better for
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
both parties not just one
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
given given all that
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
additional work that might be provided
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
by the proposal
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
is that a problem at all
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
it might be
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
it might be
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
i would not say
 
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
no and then in
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
a year we need three more additional
 
01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.310 align:start position:0%
a year we need three more additional
people

01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
the issue is that there is no way of
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
knowing for example in 2019 when
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
education was added
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
the difficulty was oh my gosh you know
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
all of the k-12 schools and charter
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
schools have an opportunity to file
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
charges and there was just no way to
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
understand how many and so i could
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
foresee a flood of charges and
 
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
statistically speaking that has not
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
happened so
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to say yet i leave
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
my hand partially open in case i need to
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
come back to
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
request additional bodies to help
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome any other
 
01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.070 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome any other
questions

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
miss malachi
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
now um
 
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
when i look at this bill
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
it makes me wonder how
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
vaccine status could become a protected
 
01:11:37.679 --> 01:11:38.790 align:start position:0%
vaccine status could become a protected
class

01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
class
 
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
because when i think of a protective
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
class the um characteristics are
 
01:11:44.159 --> 01:11:45.510 align:start position:0%
class the um characteristics are
immutable

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
immutable
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
such as except for religion immutable
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
such as race gender
 
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation gender identity
 
01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.310 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation gender identity
disability

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
disability
 
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
in national origin those characteristics
 
01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:59.110 align:start position:0%
in national origin those characteristics
are

01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.870 align:start position:0%
are
immutable

01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
immutable
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
and generic
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
so how
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
would vaccine status fit into that
 
01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.189 align:start position:0%
would vaccine status fit into that
scheme

01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
scheme
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
as being a protected class
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very very much represent
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo for the question
 
01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:16.870 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo for the question
um

01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
you are 500 correct yes the the 1964
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
civil rights act um
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
preventing discrimination is based on
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
immutable characteristics
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
the short answer to your question is
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
if the if the
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
legislative body decides that this is
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
something to be added to our statute
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
then it is our the commission's
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
responsibility to move forward with
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement of that additional
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:52.640 align:start position:0%

01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
you can turn on the microphone
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
and identify yourself
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
yeah this is my first time doing this so
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
i'll try to
 
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
maintain my composure here my name is
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
wayne i live locally um
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.790 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
this is all new territory that we're in
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
some of the things that this gentleman
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned i've seen at
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
where i work
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
there are there are certain exemptions
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
there weren't many that i know of i'm
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
not at the level where i would have that
 
01:14:03.199 --> 01:14:04.390 align:start position:0%
not at the level where i would have that
information

01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
but what i've seen personally um
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
people are already being discriminated
 
01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.149 align:start position:0%
people are already being discriminated
against

01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:14:10.159 --> 01:14:11.669 align:start position:0%
against
whether

01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
if they eat with co-workers or so
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
they're vacs they're unvexed
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
if they change in their locker room
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
they're vexed or unvexed
 
01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:21.990 align:start position:0%
they're vexed or unvexed
um

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not an anti-vaxxer i was in the
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
military i've received many
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinations um
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
i think you know
 
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
the schools require it but i don't think
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.350 align:start position:0%
the schools
um

01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge there are certain kids
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
that get that that don't get vaccinated
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
for whatever reasons the school doesn't
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
tell the rest of the students or the
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
families that they either had the shot
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
or not um
 
01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:49.910 align:start position:0%
or not um
so

01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
if you have if you just put a label on
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
it as whether you have it or not
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
i guess that's my issue
 
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
that's why i think it should be
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
protected information you shouldn't have
 
01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.550 align:start position:0%
protected information you shouldn't have
to

01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
let it be known whether you have it or
 
01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.470 align:start position:0%
let it be known whether you have it or
not

01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:05.350 align:start position:0%
not
so

01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
do you is there anyone with a question
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:13.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
which way no okay thank you and thank
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
you wayne for taking my question
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
you mentioned in the hospitals right now
 
01:15:28.239 --> 01:15:29.510 align:start position:0%
you mentioned in the hospitals right now
where

01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
people are say you're in the lunchroom
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
um is it known between people who's
 
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and who is not are you saying
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's like a school system where you have
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh the hospital or whoever i mean
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
they have to protect the rights of the i
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
don't you know they're not going around
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
telling people but it is known that
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
people know
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
i mean obviously in that you know in our
 
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
line of work
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
you pretty much don't have a choice you
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
have to get it or so and there's very
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
few people that haven't gotten it for
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
whatever reason
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
but the people that have not gotten it
 
01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's those people
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
people other everybody else knows who's
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:16:12.159 --> 01:16:13.830 align:start position:0%
they are
um

01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
i do i don't treat anybody differently
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not afraid of anybody whether they
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
have it or not
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
and i also contracted covid so
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
i mean and there's a lot of people i
 
01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
know that had the vaccine
 
01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
within the institution that have gotten
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
covered so
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a magic it's not a magic
 
01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.790 align:start position:0%
it's not a magic it's not a magic
bullet

01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
bullet
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
i have other family members an entire
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
family of seven in total that did not
 
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
receive any of those vaccines or
 
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
treatments whatever you want to call
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
them and they they recovered on their
 
01:16:49.199 --> 01:16:50.709 align:start position:0%
them and they they recovered on their
own

01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm just saying like me personally
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
i've witnessed you know
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
um i mean like to come into this room we
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have to tell anybody anything you
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
know i just walked in here i brought a
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
mask out of respect but once i found out
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
i didn't need to wear it i didn't but
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
nobody has to consult with anybody to
 
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
come into this room to sit at this table
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
we're just here
 
01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
speaking as people
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
so basically to just i've witnessed the
 
01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo thank you mr
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
claire and thank you for taking my
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
question um you had said that at your
 
01:17:36.189 --> 01:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
work setting that people who are
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated everybody knows um how do
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
i can't say exactly how people know but
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
maybe the some of the people that have
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
not gotten it have talked about it
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
openly or they're not afraid and that's
 
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
their personal right
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
but to just
 
01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
put it out there that
 
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
it has to be known that's because that's
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
how i feel this is being
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
we're trying to you know i feel like
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
this bill is basically saying
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
that you don't have a right to know
 
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not i've received it or not
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
that's how i perceived it but the people
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
that know
 
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
that you know the majority of people
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
that know who who has and has not is
 
01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:20.790 align:start position:0%
that know who who has and has not is
because

discrimination
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
is the practice of unfairly treating a

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
not you agree or disagree with them
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
enshrined in our declaration of

enshrined in our declaration of
independence

01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
independence
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
is the right to life liberty and the
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
pursuit of happiness and it is the duty
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
of this legislature to protect those
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
individuals from being discriminated
 
01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:23.990 align:start position:0%
individuals from being discriminated
against

01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
this bill is very simple
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
it says that you cannot be discriminated
 
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
against for vaccination status
 
01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
we have hipaa laws on the books that
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
protect our medical privacy
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
yet we are now asking people for their
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
vaccination status in order to receive
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
services or to enter a public
 
01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:45.669 align:start position:0%
services or to enter a public
accommodation

01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
in my opinion we should not even need
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
any of these commissions because nobody
 
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
should be discriminated against for any
 
01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:52.470 align:start position:0%
should be discriminated against for any
reason

01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
no matter what we should all be treated
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
equally under the law
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
it should be very simple
 
01:35:01.109 --> 01:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
but we now have created classes of
 
01:35:01.119 --> 01:35:02.229 align:start position:0%
but we now have created classes of
people

01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
we have a law so that we don't
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
discriminate based on your sex
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
your marriage status your physical or
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
mental disability we have to keep
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
putting into statute all these
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
exceptions so that people are not
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
discriminated against it is unfortunate
 
01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
that we have come to this point
 
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
but nobody should be discriminated
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
against and nobody should be not be
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
denied access
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
to any public accommodation
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%

all the time
 
01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
we don't discriminate people because
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
they have herpes we don't discriminate
 
01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%

01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
gonorrhea or any sexual disease
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
so please we should not discriminate

other hand someone else may feel that
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%

died of a massive heart attack within 48
 
01:37:58.159 --> 01:37:59.990 align:start position:0%
died of a massive heart attack within 48
hours

01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that there have been
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
studies done
 
01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:05.270 align:start position:0%
studies done
where

01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
17 people have received vaccinations and
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
of the 17 2 have developed bell's policy
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
okay there are definite side effects and
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
definite repercussions from this
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
vaccination and to force somebody to
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
take something when we do not know what
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
because you are also putting those
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
people should have the choice it is
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
bodily integrity if
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
you want to ha i don't
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
begrudge anyone from taking a
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
vaccination or an immunization
 
01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
if they feel that is in the best
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
interest of their health
 
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
but for others who may have compromised
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
immune systems or other issues
 
01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
that would be detrimental to the health
 
01:38:53.669 --> 01:38:53.679 align:start position:0%
as we saw with my sister-in-law
 
01:38:53.679 --> 01:38:54.629 align:start position:0%
as we saw with my sister-in-law
so

01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:54.639 --> 01:38:55.510 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:58.709 align:start position:0%
you know
this

01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
us you know
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
ways to protect yourself you are wearing
 
01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:05.350 align:start position:0%
ways to protect yourself you are wearing
a

01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.629 align:start position:0%
a
mask

01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
mask
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
because you feel that will help protect
 
01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:09.430 align:start position:0%
because you feel that will help protect
you

01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
from everyone else
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
and that is your choice and it is a
 
01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:15.830 align:start position:0%
and that is your choice and it is a
choice

01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
choice
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
that has afforded us under the
 
01:39:17.199 --> 01:39:21.109 align:start position:0%
that has afforded us under the
constitution

01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative langley
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for taking my
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
question and thank you representative
 
01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
i'm truly sorry for the loss of your
 
01:39:29.119 --> 01:39:30.550 align:start position:0%
i'm truly sorry for the loss of your
sister-in-law

01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
sister-in-law
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
could i ask you on line number eight
 
01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
line eight
 
01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
are you use the language because the
 
01:39:39.109 --> 01:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
person refuses to use a medical device
 
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
how exactly do you define medical device
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative langley for
 
01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.709 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative langley for
that

01:39:46.709 --> 01:39:46.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:46.719 --> 01:39:47.750 align:start position:0%
that
question

01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
a medical device could be anything that
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
a person is forced to use that would
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
inhibit their health
 
01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
for some
 
01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
it could be an n95 mask or something to
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
that effect
 
01:40:05.229 --> 01:40:05.239 align:start position:0%
but what happens is when we do a
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all we don't take into
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
account the mental anguish that we are
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
forcing on others that for one reason or
 
01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:13.430 align:start position:0%
forcing on others that for one reason or
another

01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
for psychological reasons
 
01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:16.709 align:start position:0%
for psychological reasons
by

01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:16.719 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
wearing a medical device would cause
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
them extreme harm
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm i'm really sorry
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
now um you mentioned um
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
medical devices or we talk about medical
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
devices such as n95 mask i do believe
 
01:40:44.159 --> 01:40:45.430 align:start position:0%
devices such as n95 mask i do believe
that

01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:47.189 --> 01:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
many of us are wearing the mask to
 
01:40:50.070 --> 01:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
prevent others from getting sick that's
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
just a clarification thank you
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
is that that a question
 
01:41:01.679 --> 01:41:07.510 align:start position:0%
is that that a question
or

01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
would you believe that some of us are
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
wearing masks because we want to prevent
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
spreading infection in the in the event
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
that we do have the virus
 
01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo um i do believe
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%

for taking my question um you have
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
quoted a few studies would you mind
 
01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
sharing those with the committee at a at
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
a later time like through email
 
01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:39.030 align:start position:0%
a later time like through email
i

01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%

see what i can get you yeah well
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
they were told to me
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know if the study is actually
 
01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:48.229 align:start position:0%
i don't know if the study is actually
public

01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
it was through something in our county
 
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:59.830 --> 01:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative smith did you have a
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
question well just to follow up um do
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
you mean that your your county medical
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
officer shared those with you and if so
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
could you tell me what county because
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
then we could contact them
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
uh representatives thank you for the
 
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
question representative smith it was
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
conveyed to another representative
 
01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
and told to me
 
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
but it was in belknap county
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:28.719 align:start position:0%
representative chase thank you mr chair
 
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
i think we got off track here this is
 
01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
relative to equal access to places in
 
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
public economic accommodations
 
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
regardless of vaccine status
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
could you just i
 
01:42:47.109 --> 01:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
get back on or all of us on track as to
 
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
you're talking about what if we wanted
 
01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:50.719 align:start position:0%
to go to
 
01:42:50.719 --> 01:42:51.990 align:start position:0%
to go to
um

01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
a concert and they asked you to show
 
01:42:54.159 --> 01:42:55.030 align:start position:0%
a concert and they asked you to show
your

01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
your vaccine card and you don't have one
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
because you're not
 
01:43:01.590 --> 01:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
you didn't get vaccinated this is what
 
01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
the bill is about correct it's not about
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
the choice of having a vaccine or i'm
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
very sorry again about your
 
01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
sister-in-law and maybe the 17 people
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
that had bell's palsy but when you're
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
thinking of the millions of people and
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
trying to save lives
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
i just would like to get back on track
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
with that uh well thank you for the
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
question representative chase um yes it
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
is about vaccine status and it is about
 
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
going to public places and concerts
 
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
but we have to understand
 
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
that we have right to privacy of our
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
medical information and asking someone
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
to show their medical vaccination status
 
01:43:40.149 --> 01:43:40.159 align:start position:0%
is a and
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
is a violation of private
 
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
medical information you should not have
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
we have hipaa laws for certain reasons
 
01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
but yet we're making an exception for
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
vaccination status for a specific
 
01:43:52.159 --> 01:43:56.310 align:start position:0%

01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
other

other

01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
i guess the question i have
 
01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:05.270 align:start position:0%
i guess the question i have
you

01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
addressing specifically public
 
01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:09.270 align:start position:0%
addressing specifically public
accommodations

01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
accommodations
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gordon and yes
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
i am specifically addressing at equal
 
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
access to pump public accommodations it
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
is a civil right and no one should be
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
discriminated against for any reason
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
we just heard a bill although
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
it was didn't deal with directly with
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
vaccination status but immunization
 
01:44:29.199 --> 01:44:30.550 align:start position:0%
vaccination status but immunization
status

01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
status
 
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
which was more comprehensive in terms of
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:39.669 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
is there a reason why you picked public
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
accommodation as opposed to making it
 
01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:46.550 align:start position:0%
accommodation as opposed to making it
broader

01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
broader
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
there is a reason because i had
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
constituents and this is just a
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
duplicate of my bill that i introduced
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
last year that never received a vote um
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
due to the uh
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
not finishing the voting on the in
 
01:44:58.800 --> 01:44:59.910 align:start position:0%
not finishing the voting on the in
session

01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:45:02.310 --> 01:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
and it came about because i had
 
01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:04.629 align:start position:0%
and it came about because i had
constituents

01:45:04.629 --> 01:45:04.639 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
that had gone to
 
01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
places of public accommodation for over
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
20 years and were then denied access
 
01:45:13.590 --> 01:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
for refusal to wear a medical device or
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
to show a vaccination status
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
they then could not get their groceries
 
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
from their local store
 
01:45:23.669 --> 01:45:23.679 align:start position:0%
that it affected them
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
and their family and that affects their
 
01:45:25.679 --> 01:45:30.229 align:start position:0%
and their family and that affects their
health

01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm going to plead ignorance here
 
01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of i'm sure somewhere in
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:45:38.159 --> 01:45:39.030 align:start position:0%
the law
the

01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
public accommodation is defined
 
01:45:43.109 --> 01:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and and
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
i suspect that that is
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
when we think generally of public
 
01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
accommodation we think of
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
hotels motels and restaurants but
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
i suspect it's defined more broadly than
 
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
that is that correct in chapter two
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
under the rsa
 
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
i believe is definitions
 
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
and you're in intending it to be more
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned grocery stores you're
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
tending it to be more broadly
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
construed than simply restaurants or
 
01:46:16.239 --> 01:46:17.030 align:start position:0%
construed than simply restaurants or
or

01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
the committee again my name is kathy
 
01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
bizarro-thundberg executive vice
 
01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%

01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
association representing all 26 acute
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
care hospitals and all specialty
 
01:47:06.390 --> 01:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals in our state
 
01:47:07.990 --> 01:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire hospital association
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
is opposed to house bill 1490 fm
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
the bill before you would provide that
 
01:47:14.709 --> 01:47:14.719 align:start position:0%
an individual shall be not be denied
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
access to places of public accommodation
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
placed on vaccination status ordered the
 
01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
decision not to use a medical device
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
we do not believe it's appropriate to
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
include vaccination status as a
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
protected class under the state
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
commission for human rights
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
this committee just heard a similar bill
 
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 1260 as well as a bill last
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
week house bill 1519 which we also
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
testified in opposition
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
this bill as well other this bill as
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
well as other bills before this
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
committee attempts to insert additional
 
01:47:45.189 --> 01:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
classes into the statute that protects
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
individuals from discrimination it's our
 
01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
position that adding these additional
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
classes is not appropriate and not in
 
01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:53.560 align:start position:0%
not the intention of our
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws
 
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
we believe all these bills are focused
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
on without explicitly stating so an
 
01:48:01.590 --> 01:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
attempt to insert vague language into
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
statute against covert 19 vaccine or
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
other public health measure measures as
 
01:48:07.590 --> 01:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
such as mass
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
we're also concerned that the term
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
medical device in this bill is vague and
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
misleading especially if the intent is
 
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
really focused on masks
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
the result of all these bills will just
 
01:48:18.790 --> 01:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
lead to lawsuits and other further
 
01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
confusion among employers employee
 
01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679 align:start position:0%
employees and patrons of public
 
01:48:23.679 --> 01:48:25.030 align:start position:0%
employees and patrons of public
establishments

01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's our position that employers in any
 
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
business open to the public have a right
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
to determine what is best for their
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
employees their clients their patients
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
and or their patrons
 
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
requiring vaccinations of healthcare
 
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
workers from communicable disease is not
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
new to hospitals as i mentioned earlier
 
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
they have required vaccination against
 
01:48:45.669 --> 01:48:45.679 align:start position:0%
several communicable and deadly diseases
 
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
such as mumps measles rubella
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
chickenpox diphtheria tetanus pertussis
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
and influenza as a condition of
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
employment with the same type of medical
 
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
and religious exemptions allowed for
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
covert 19 vaccines
 
01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
we believe requiring vaccinations is
 
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely the right thing to do for the
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
health and safety of our patients our
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
staff and the citizens of new hampshire
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of hospital staff have
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated against cover 19 or have
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
received exemptions and we've heard from
 
01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
many many health care workers who
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
support the vaccine requirement to
 
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
protect the health of themselves as well
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
as their patients
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
i just want to also add to my testimony
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to clarify one thing that
 
01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill mentioned
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
regarding hipaa health insurance
 
01:49:29.589 --> 01:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
portability and accountability act it is
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
not applied correctly by the sponsor
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
hipaa requires covered entities such as
 
01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals and other health care
 
01:49:38.070 --> 01:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
providers to protect information that
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
they have received it is it does not
 
01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
apply to individuals who were asked to
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
share their information so i just want
 
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that was clarified
 
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
in conclusion we are opposed to house
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
bill 1490 fn and we urge this committee
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
to find this bill in expedient to
 
01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you for the opportunity
 
01:49:57.990 --> 01:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
to present our testimony
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
are there questions
 
01:50:01.589 --> 01:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
yes representative simpson

01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
if this were if this bill were to go
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
into effect i'm trying to get my head
 
01:50:09.679 --> 01:50:10.470 align:start position:0%
into effect i'm trying to get my head
around

01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
the violation of rights of those who are
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
physically disabled in some way that
 
01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
they can't be vaccinated or are so
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
immunocompromised that the antibodies do
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
not build enough
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
um and i wondered if you
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
if your members in the hospital
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
association or for you or if you have
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
talked through
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
that right
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
we understand that there are individuals
 
01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
that just cannot um have the vaccine for
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
a variety of reasons because they're
 
01:50:40.629 --> 01:50:40.639 align:start position:0%
immunocompromised or they may be
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
allergic to one or more of the
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
ingredients in the vaccine that's why
 
01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
there are other mitigation measures that
 
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
are in place such as mass
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
and social distancing washing hands
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
staying home when you're sick
 
01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:53.430 align:start position:0%
staying home when you're sick
so

01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
vaccine is just one of the many tools
 
01:50:57.589 --> 01:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
that can be used from a public health
 
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
perspective to support those who cannot
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
other questions representative sylvia
 
01:51:08.709 --> 01:51:08.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
is it the new hampshire
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
hospital association's position that
 
01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:18.070 align:start position:0%
hospital association's position that
patients

01:51:18.070 --> 01:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:51:19.990 --> 01:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
should be vaccinated before getting
 
01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.189 align:start position:0%
should be vaccinated before getting
treatment

01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
01:51:21.199 --> 01:51:22.470 align:start position:0%
treatment
no

01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
that is not what we're saying
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
we will treat any patient that comes
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
into our hospitals who are in need
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
so you're opposing this
 
01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:40.310 align:start position:0%
so you're opposing this
measure

01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
it would seem
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
that you
 
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
have some desire to discriminate against
 
01:51:49.109 --> 01:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
somebody we believe that any uh
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
location whether it's public
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
accommodation or any other location that
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
requires access to someone's vaccination
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
status or requires that a mask be worn
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
that they should be allowed to ask for
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
those accommodations to be put into
 
01:52:04.149 --> 01:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
place for those individuals who want to
 
01:52:04.159 --> 01:52:06.790 align:start position:0%
place for those individuals who want to
partake

01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:08.229 --> 01:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
so you you testified that you want to
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
protect your workers
 
01:52:15.589 --> 01:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
but you also testified that your workers
 
01:52:15.599 --> 01:52:16.550 align:start position:0%
but you also testified that your workers
are

01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
almost 100 percent vaccinated
 
01:52:21.669 --> 01:52:21.679 align:start position:0%
can you clarify
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
the danger that
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
a person poses
 
01:52:27.910 --> 01:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
if they don't even present to have
 
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
any symptoms of the disease well as i
 
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned one of the other mitigating
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
factors is also mask wearing and so
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%
hospitals do require anyone entering a
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
hospital setting to wear a mask and so
 
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
it is their right to be able to ask for
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:52.229 --> 01:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
01:52:53.760 --> 01:53:03.830 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony

is it
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
i'm coming today in um
 
01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:29.679 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill
 
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
i am a i am a um living breathing
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
um vaccine injured individual not from
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
the covet 19 vaccine i develop bell's
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
palsy after a flu shot seven years ago
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
um i'd had the flu shot numerous times
 
01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:45.589 align:start position:0%
um i'd had the flu shot numerous times
before

01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
never had a problem
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
i um
 
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
but myself and seven of my co-workers
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
all develop bell's palsy that year
 
01:53:56.790 --> 01:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
i'm one of the lucky ones i have a
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
slight droop to the left side but other
 
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
than that i have no um
 
01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:04.310 align:start position:0%
than that i have no um
lasting

01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:06.070 align:start position:0%
 
results

01:54:06.070 --> 01:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
results
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
this bill if if not passed does
 
01:54:12.070 --> 01:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
discriminate against people like me
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
the cdc has now said that cloth masks
 
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
don't do anything to protect you
 
01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:20.229 align:start position:0%
don't do anything to protect you
um

01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
but if you want to wear masks because
 
01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
you feel you're more protected or you
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
feel you more you're more than
 
01:54:29.109 --> 01:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
protecting you're protecting me more i'm
 
01:54:30.629 --> 01:54:30.639 align:start position:0%
okay with that
 
01:54:33.750 --> 01:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh with regards to the vaccine itself i
 
01:54:36.870 --> 01:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
cannot take this vaccine because to date
 
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
they they have not provided every single
 
01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:40.870 align:start position:0%
they they have not provided every single
ingredient

01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
ingredient
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
we don't know exactly what caused my
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury but i am not willing to
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
make that choice to take a vaccine and
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
end up a statistic
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
i also have a very close friend
 
01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
um whose son died over the weekend
 
01:54:57.840 --> 01:54:58.790 align:start position:0%
um whose son died over the weekend
from

01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it'll be identified as a
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury but he had his
 
01:55:06.629 --> 01:55:06.639 align:start position:0%
vaccine booster on friday he died on
 
01:55:06.639 --> 01:55:08.070 align:start position:0%
vaccine booster on friday he died on
saturday

01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
saturday
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
it was following a flight to florida so
 
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there was a combination
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
all i'm saying folks is that this
 
01:55:20.070 --> 01:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine is and and the cdc and num
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
numerous other people have now come out
 
01:55:25.109 --> 01:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
and said the vaccine will not prevent us
 
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
you or me
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
from getting covet 19. it will lessen
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
the the um
 
01:55:38.070 --> 01:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
lessen the symptoms i've had coven 19.
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
um fortunately i did not have severe
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
symptoms i don't feel that i should that
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
i should be discriminated against
 
01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:47.830 align:start position:0%
i should be discriminated against
because

01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
i can't take this vaccine
 
01:55:53.910 --> 01:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
and i won't take this vaccine
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
and it's getting to the point that
 
01:56:00.709 --> 01:56:00.719 align:start position:0%
i'm starting to feel as though i need
 
01:56:02.229 --> 01:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
the protection from the state of new
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire because
 
01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
i have been denied i am now covered
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%

my religious and my
 
01:56:13.109 --> 01:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
medical exemptions
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
from a
 
01:56:17.669 --> 01:56:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
company in massachusetts in health care
 
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
so at this point i support this bill
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
because i feel
 
01:56:28.149 --> 01:56:28.159 align:start position:0%
we the people of new hampshire need to
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
um not be discriminated events against
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%

i i've listened carefully to
 
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
some serious charges that you laid out
 
01:56:59.350 --> 01:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
and and realize how
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
complicated all of this is for all of us
 
01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:04.229 align:start position:0%
complicated all of this is for all of us
what

01:57:04.229 --> 01:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
what interests me is that this
 
01:57:11.669 --> 01:57:11.679 align:start position:0%
particular bill refers only to places of
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
public accommodation
 
01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:15.109 align:start position:0%
public accommodation
and

01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
yet all of your concerns seem to
 
01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
relate to all kinds of situations but
 
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
not necessarily public accommodations so
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering what attracted you to
 
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
this narrow
 
01:57:32.229 --> 01:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
legislation rather than for example the
 
01:57:33.669 --> 01:57:33.679 align:start position:0%
bill we heard
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
earlier today
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
i would have liked to have been here for
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
the bill you heard earlier i was in
 
01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
another session ah
 
01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:41.830 align:start position:0%
another session ah
um

01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
so legitimate problems we're all having
 
01:57:47.109 --> 01:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
these legitimate problems um with
 
01:57:50.070 --> 01:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
regards yes this is a much more narrow
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
um the other one is a much broader was a
 
01:57:55.109 --> 01:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
much broader um
 
01:57:55.119 --> 01:57:56.070 align:start position:0%
much broader um
i

01:57:56.070 --> 01:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
made a choice
 
01:57:58.709 --> 01:57:58.719 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:57:58.719 --> 01:57:59.430 align:start position:0%
um and
and

01:57:59.430 --> 01:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
with regards to public accommodations
 
01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
that is exactly my point is i have been
 
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
my doctor
 
01:58:09.750 --> 01:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
who is a member of the new hampshire
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
hospital association
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
will not
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
provide me with an exemption for this
 
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine because she is too afraid to
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
lose her license
 
01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
that is not acceptable and the fact that
 
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital association and
 
01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
and all these other people come here
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
oppose these kind of bills is not okay
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
the money that they are making
 
01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
the money that they are making off the
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
backs of us is not okay
 
01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be recognized and it
 
01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be identified we you can go to
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
the verse report and you can see now
 
01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
almost a thousand people
 
01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:51.750 align:start position:0%
almost a thousand people
no

01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
more than a thousand people are vaccine
 
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
injured from this covet 19
 
01:58:58.550 --> 01:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
shot in new hampshire more than a
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
that alone says it's time it's time to
 
01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
start discriminating against the people
 
01:59:08.709 --> 01:59:08.719 align:start position:0%
that either don't want to take the
 
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine or like me
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
i can't
 
01:59:15.270 --> 01:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
and the masks
 
01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
putting masks on children
 
01:59:20.070 --> 01:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
and forcing them in a public
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
in a public place to wear a mask to
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
eight to ten hours a day there are tons
 
01:59:27.189 --> 01:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
of studies regarding
 
01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
um issues with that and reactive
 
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
attachment disorder when did we lose
 
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
sight of the emotional
 
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'm sorry
 
01:59:42.629 --> 01:59:42.639 align:start position:0%
mr chair if i could ask that you
 
01:59:45.990 --> 01:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
give us the citations for those studies
 
01:59:48.870 --> 01:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
that you've quoted because um
 
01:59:50.709 --> 01:59:50.719 align:start position:0%
that would be very very for the reactive
 
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
attachment disorder that was one you
 
01:59:56.149 --> 01:59:56.159 align:start position:0%
also talked about uh
 
01:59:56.159 --> 01:59:57.109 align:start position:0%
also talked about uh
number

01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:59:59.350 --> 01:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
one where you refer to the numbers of
 
02:00:03.189 --> 02:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
people who had vaccine uh
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh reactions that's the verse report
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a public
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
um but i will get you that information
 
02:00:12.310 --> 02:00:12.320 align:start position:0%

any other questions representative
horrigan

02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
horrigan
 
02:00:21.990 --> 02:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you one of the pieces of
 
02:00:25.589 --> 02:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
evidence you cited in your testimony was
 
02:00:27.669 --> 02:00:27.679 align:start position:0%
that something had happened to you in
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts at a healthcare facility
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
of some sort and
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
presumably you want to change our laws
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
so the protections so
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
they're more protective than in
 
02:00:40.149 --> 02:00:40.159 align:start position:0%
what they have in massachusetts so
 
02:00:40.159 --> 02:00:41.109 align:start position:0%
what they have in massachusetts so
without

02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
giving away any like
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
sensitive details what could you flesh
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
out that anecdote just a little bit more
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
i mean you did give it a time recently
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
and a place massachusetts so that's
 
02:00:52.709 --> 02:00:52.719 align:start position:0%
better than a lot of the anecdotes we
 
02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
hear in this committee but you want to
 
02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
flesh it out a little bit just
 
02:00:58.390 --> 02:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
you know just serve a few a few
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
salient details just to make it more
 
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
convincing thanks i was a private
 
02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:04.719 align:start position:0%
non-profit i worked for a private
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit insurance company
 
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
that dealt only with medicare and
 
02:01:11.109 --> 02:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
medicaid patients
 
02:01:12.629 --> 02:01:12.639 align:start position:0%
so they have
 
02:01:14.310 --> 02:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
they receive a lot of money from the
 
02:01:16.870 --> 02:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
federal government with regards to the
 
02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
covert 19 max
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
bandit mandate back
 
02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
covet 19 vaccine mandate
 
02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:23.830 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:01:25.270 --> 02:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
this so that that's the
 
02:01:30.149 --> 02:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
is does that give you enough information
 
02:01:31.589 --> 02:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
i was a new hampshire resident but
 
02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
working in massachusetts oh so this is
 
02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:34.550 align:start position:0%
working in massachusetts oh so this is

massachusetts and
 
02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
you're discriminated against there in
 
02:01:42.070 --> 02:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
the workplace is that what it is
 
02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
well they refused my medical and
 
02:01:48.149 --> 02:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
um religious exemptions because they
 
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
they said that um i couldn't get a note
 
02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
from my doctor
 
02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:55.679 align:start position:0%
that i was met and i gave them the
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
information that i was vaccine injured

non-profit in massachusetts um
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
02:02:34.950 --> 02:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's required we work with um like i
 
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
said said um in massachusetts they're
 
02:02:39.669 --> 02:02:39.679 align:start position:0%
called dual eligible so they're um
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
they're on medicare and medicaid so
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
they're either
 
02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
disabled adults or elderly low-income
 
02:02:48.719 --> 02:02:50.629 align:start position:0%
disabled adults or elderly low-income
and

02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:52.470 --> 02:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i did was i was a
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
social worker that went into their homes
 
02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639 align:start position:0%
and worked with them
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
we'd it's a requirement to have the flu
 
02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
shot or to have an exemption
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
um i'd always had my flu shot with them
 
02:03:07.030 --> 02:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
i'd worked for them for a number of
 
02:03:10.470 --> 02:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
years uh for whatever reason that year
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
um my and there were a hundred of us on
 
02:03:16.149 --> 02:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
there were 100 of us
 
02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
um during that
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
rollout of the flu that the flu shot
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
that developed belt and out of the
 
02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
hundred seven of us developed bell's
 
02:03:28.070 --> 02:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
palsy of all different and it was within
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
24 hours of having that flu shot
 
02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:31.270 align:start position:0%
24 hours of having that flu shot
um

02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:32.149 align:start position:0%
um
but

02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
i was also completely aware that that
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
was a net that that was a potential
 
02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
consequence and not typically
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh it's always there's a potential for a
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
side effect but it's not
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
a typical side effect and like i said to
 
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
this day we don't know why
 
02:03:50.950 --> 02:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
out of the seven of us that develop
 
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
bell's palsy
 
02:03:56.069 --> 02:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
only two had never had a flu shot before
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
so there were five of us that had had
 
02:03:59.830 --> 02:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
flu shots for years and years and years
 
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
and for whatever reason that year we
 
02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
developed bell's palsy
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
may i follow up
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
thank you um so were there any legal
 
02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
ramifications like a class action suit
 
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
or anything like that amongst the folks
 
02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
who were
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know affected by
 
02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
the flu shot
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
i i can only speak for myself there was
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
no class action um or there was no
 
02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
litigation or action um against my
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
employer from me because i was
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
completely educated and i knew that that
 
02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
was a potential consequence
 
02:04:33.199 --> 02:04:34.149 align:start position:0%
was a potential consequence
um

02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
i also um
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
i knew that like so i was fully informed
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
and i took the flu shot and um and i'd
 
02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:45.679 align:start position:0%
had the and i've had the flu shot since
 
02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
knowing that that is a potential side
 
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
effect for me um
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
but i've chosen
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
to i've made that choice to take the flu
 
02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
shot because it was a
 
02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
isolated incident and i just am very
 
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
careful on
 
02:05:05.669 --> 02:05:05.679 align:start position:0%
with regards to what's in the flu shots
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
now so in if they're if uh for instance
 
02:05:12.550 --> 02:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
um my doctor has identified i have an
 
02:05:14.790 --> 02:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
allergy to magnesium
 
02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:16.069 align:start position:0%
allergy to magnesium
most

02:05:16.069 --> 02:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
most
 
02:05:18.149 --> 02:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
um vaccinations
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
do have magnesium in them
 
02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%
um so it depends on the type of
 
02:05:25.510 --> 02:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
magnesium the amount of the compound
 
02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%
things like that so as long as they give
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
me that information then i can make an
 
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
educated decision on whether or not
 
02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
i will take that vaccine or not the
 
02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
problem with the kova 19 vaccine is they
 
02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
have not yet given us us that
 
02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:40.390 align:start position:0%
have not yet given us us that
information

02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:05:44.950 --> 02:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:05:46.629 --> 02:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:05:46.639 --> 02:05:48.229 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
today

02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:05:58.470 --> 02:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
just a very brief
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
yes just a very brief uh note
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
um about discrimination and how it
 
02:06:09.990 --> 02:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
occurs at sort of an illustrated point
 
02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:10.870 align:start position:0%
occurs at sort of an illustrated point
um

02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
from my experience in the workplace or
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
in the place of public accommodation
 
02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
the way it becomes known that a person
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
is vaccinated or not
 
02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:24.310 align:start position:0%
is vaccinated or not
is

02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
and i've never seen this before in years
 
02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:28.870 align:start position:0%
and i've never seen this before in years
past

02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
past
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
with other vaccines but in this vaccine
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
in particular
 
02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
is that people for the last two years
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
since the vaccine is rolled out
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
in the workplace or in a place of public
 
02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
accommodation announce
 
02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
that they are vaccinated
 
02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:46.629 align:start position:0%
that they are vaccinated
um

02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
and then they go around say there's a
 
02:06:48.159 --> 02:06:49.109 align:start position:0%
and then they go around say there's a
group

02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
group
 
02:06:50.709 --> 02:06:50.719 align:start position:0%
each one announces that they had the
 
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine when they had the vaccine how
 
02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
much they've been vaccinated
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
and then the person who is not chosen to
 
02:06:59.910 --> 02:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
have a vaccine
 
02:06:59.920 --> 02:07:00.870 align:start position:0%
have a vaccine
is

02:07:00.870 --> 02:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
has no protection against
 
02:07:05.830 --> 02:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
their privacy because
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
they can only remain silent
 
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
or say that they have they don't want to
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
disclose it
 
02:07:12.790 --> 02:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's obvious
 
02:07:13.830 --> 02:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
that they
 
02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
have not been vaccinated
 
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
and so this is how it's happening
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
i in my experience
 
02:07:22.079 --> 02:07:23.589 align:start position:0%
i in my experience
anecdotally

02:07:23.589 --> 02:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
anecdotally
 
02:07:25.990 --> 02:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
talking to other people in workplaces or
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
other places of public accommodation
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
it's now become
 
02:07:34.950 --> 02:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh the the social pressure is enormous
 
02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:35.830 align:start position:0%
uh the the social pressure is enormous
to

02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
disclose and talk about
 
02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
how you've been vaccinated and so it's
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
your silence is no uh guarantee
 
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh of your privacy
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
and that is the only point i wanted to
 
02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:51.119 --> 02:07:54.550 align:start position:0%
 
questions

02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
um represent oregon did you have a
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
question um yes well there's um
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
i assume you're not too
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
few motives to them but
 
02:08:05.910 --> 02:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
obviously your co-workers are uh
 
02:08:08.069 --> 02:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
probably very concerned about
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
contracting a respiratory virus that has
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
killed over 800 000 people yes okay oh
 
02:08:14.719 --> 02:08:16.629 align:start position:0%
killed over 800 000 people yes okay oh
um

02:08:16.629 --> 02:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:18.310 --> 02:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
well do you
 
02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
okay sorry thank you thank you um so do
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
you feel that like the fear of
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
a co-worker spreading a respiratory
 
02:08:29.669 --> 02:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
virus to you is that a
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern for your co-workers
 
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
to be expressing are you saying they
 
02:08:37.030 --> 02:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
should not be expressing that
 
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
no i'm not making a judgment about
 
02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:44.950 align:start position:0%
no i'm not making a judgment about
why

02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
or if it's appropriate
 
02:08:49.030 --> 02:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
but similar to other types of
 
02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:50.550 align:start position:0%
but similar to other types of
discrimination

02:08:50.550 --> 02:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
02:08:52.629 --> 02:08:52.639 align:start position:0%
such as gender
 
02:08:52.639 --> 02:08:53.910 align:start position:0%
such as gender
identity

02:08:53.910 --> 02:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
identity
 
02:08:53.920 --> 02:09:00.069 align:start position:0%
identity
and

02:09:00.069 --> 02:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know physical or mental disability
 
02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:04.870 align:start position:0%
you know physical or mental disability
you

02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
it is um it's just uh you can't remain
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
silent and
 
02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
you are just therefore discriminated
 
02:09:14.550 --> 02:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
against after trying to be remain silent
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
and try to keep your vaccination status
 
02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:18.790 align:start position:0%
and try to keep your vaccination status
private

02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
private
 
02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's similar to
 
02:09:23.189 --> 02:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
say in a workplace or a place of public
 
02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
accommodation when somebody says
 
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not gay
 
02:09:30.310 --> 02:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
are you gay no i'm not gay are you gay
 
02:09:32.470 --> 02:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
and then it becomes an issue
 
02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
where well you did not disclose that
 
02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:35.669 align:start position:0%
where well you did not disclose that
you're

02:09:35.669 --> 02:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
not gay
 
02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:38.709 align:start position:0%
not gay
so

02:09:38.709 --> 02:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
we can infer
 
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
that you are indeed gay
 
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
and then that is when discrimination
 
02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:48.639 align:start position:0%
happens so and that is what i've seen
 
02:09:48.639 --> 02:09:50.310 align:start position:0%
happens so and that is what i've seen
from

02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
in the workplace or in places of even
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
public accommodation this is happening
 
02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
in public meetings
 
02:09:59.430 --> 02:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
and people go around and make the
 
02:10:01.510 --> 02:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
disclosure because there's so much
 
02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
pressure social pressure to do so and
 
02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:12.229 --> 02:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:13.830 --> 02:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:14.629 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
today

02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:10:40.870 --> 02:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
good morning again
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
my name is ani malachi i'm the executive
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
director of the human rights commission
 
02:10:49.510 --> 02:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
i am providing informational testimony
 
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
this morning on hb 1490
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
as uh the commission is not taking a
 
02:10:56.550 --> 02:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
position on this bill
 
02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
i think one of the questions that i
 
02:10:59.669 --> 02:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
would like to address
 
02:11:02.709 --> 02:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
was relative to public accommodation and
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
so to assist with that i will read from
 
02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
our statute it won't take too long
 
02:11:12.069 --> 02:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
what we specify as a public okay i was
 
02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
just about to say good grief i had it
 
02:11:15.189 --> 02:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
pulled up and ready to go and then it
 
02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
got disappeared um so public places of
 
02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
public accommodation includes any inn
 
02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
tavern or hotel
 
02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:25.760 align:start position:0%

or for the benefit use or accommodations
 
02:11:34.149 --> 02:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
of those seeking health recreational
 
02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:37.599 align:start position:0%

02:11:55.830 --> 02:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
facilities or goods to the general
 
02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:56.870 align:start position:0%
facilities or goods to the general
public

02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
public accommodation shall not include
 
02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
any institution or club which is in its
 
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
nature distinctly uh private
 
02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:05.510 align:start position:0%
nature distinctly uh private
so

02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
that is the definition of public
 
02:12:07.199 --> 02:12:08.950 align:start position:0%
that is the definition of public
accommodation

02:12:08.950 --> 02:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:11.589 align:start position:0%
accommodation
and

02:12:11.589 --> 02:12:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:11.599 --> 02:12:12.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:12:12.550 --> 02:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
let's see and i have one other note here
 
02:12:15.199 --> 02:12:17.990 align:start position:0%
let's see and i have one other note here
um

02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
further in the pro
 
02:12:22.229 --> 02:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
the proposed piece of legislation
 
02:12:23.830 --> 02:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
medical devices
 
02:12:25.599 --> 02:12:26.550 align:start position:0%
medical devices
um

02:12:26.550 --> 02:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
the fda's definition and this is just
 
02:12:36.069 --> 02:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
let's see so
 
02:12:39.669 --> 02:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
and i know there was some conversation
 
02:12:39.679 --> 02:12:40.870 align:start position:0%
and i know there was some conversation
um

02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:41.910 align:start position:0%
um
about

02:12:41.910 --> 02:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:12:43.510 --> 02:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
medical treatments and refusal
 
02:12:45.990 --> 02:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
treatments and although the right to
 
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
refuse a medical treatment is fundament
 
02:12:51.030 --> 02:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
is a fundamental right recognized by the
 
02:12:53.109 --> 02:12:53.119 align:start position:0%
united states supreme court
 
02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
the commission sees that medical device
 
02:12:58.390 --> 02:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
in this particular language of this bill
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
is somewhat vague and it can apply to
 
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
and this is the fda's definition of
 
02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
medical device
 
02:13:07.589 --> 02:13:07.599 align:start position:0%
medical devices range from simple tongue
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
depressors and bed pans to complex
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
programmable pacemakers closed loop
 
02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
artificial pancreas systems and
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
blood glucose monitors etc
 
02:13:21.189 --> 02:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
understanding it it makes it a bit vague
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
and we would hope if this were to pass
 
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
it there would be some clarification on
 
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
medical device and finally having both
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
elements so including the vaccination
 
02:13:36.790 --> 02:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
status being added and
 
02:13:39.189 --> 02:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
refusal of a medical device it does make
 
02:13:41.109 --> 02:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
it could potentially make it a bit more
 
02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:43.599 align:start position:0%
challenging for a business to provide a
 
02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation so an example
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
of that would be
 
02:13:49.750 --> 02:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
if they
 
02:13:54.229 --> 02:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
required you to wear a medical device
 
02:13:56.790 --> 02:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
but you couldn't because of a health
 
02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
condition of some sort or you just
 
02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
didn't want to the business could do
 
02:14:03.189 --> 02:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
some form of reasonable accommodation
 
02:14:05.189 --> 02:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
and we saw some of that
 
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic where they could
 
02:14:10.149 --> 02:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
meet the person outside or maybe they
 
02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
could wear a face shield versus a mask
 
02:14:14.550 --> 02:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
and so if both of these elements are in
 
02:14:16.950 --> 02:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
here then it makes it a bit more
 
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
challenging for the business to look for
 
02:14:22.550 --> 02:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
a reasonable accommodation to
 
02:14:25.270 --> 02:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
if they are if they are requiring a mask
 
02:14:27.430 --> 02:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
or some other medical device it makes it
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
a more challenging for them to to work
 
02:14:31.990 --> 02:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
around that so as not to be
 
02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:33.669 align:start position:0%
around that so as not to be
discriminatory

02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
discriminatory
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
towards someone if this element passes
 
02:14:38.550 --> 02:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
so thank you with that i end my
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
testimony and i'm available for
 
02:14:40.079 --> 02:14:42.149 align:start position:0%
testimony and i'm available for
questions

02:14:42.149 --> 02:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you very much
 
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
that's very helpful
 
02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:50.470 align:start position:0%
that's very helpful
um

02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:52.390 --> 02:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you didn't read absolutely
 
02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
every word in that definition of public
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
accommodation and for that i thank you
 
02:15:01.270 --> 02:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
um but i want to inquire as to whether
 
02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:02.069 align:start position:0%
um but i want to inquire as to whether
um

02:15:02.069 --> 02:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
in that definition
 
02:15:06.550 --> 02:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
you see um
 
02:15:09.750 --> 02:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
that either a public institution of
 
02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:10.870 align:start position:0%
that either a public institution of
higher

02:15:10.870 --> 02:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
higher
 
02:15:14.229 --> 02:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
uh learning or a private institution of
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
higher learning would be included as a
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
public accommodation
 
02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for the question
 
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
at this time it is not
 
02:15:27.189 --> 02:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
but i will also reserve the opportunity
 
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
to further scrutinize and email you back
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
if that is not the correct answer
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
but i do believe places of education are
 
02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:40.229 --> 02:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you for
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
being so careful about
 
02:15:44.629 --> 02:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
about checking your own facts we really
 
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:48.830 align:start position:0%
 
other

02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
questions i have a question
 
02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:52.550 align:start position:0%
questions i have a question
yes

02:15:52.550 --> 02:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:57.669 --> 02:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
this applies to
 
02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
access to public accommodations
 
02:16:04.709 --> 02:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
so the question is in the case of an
 
02:16:04.719 --> 02:16:06.229 align:start position:0%
so the question is in the case of an
employer

02:16:06.229 --> 02:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
employer
 
02:16:09.990 --> 02:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
so an employer who operates
 
02:16:15.030 --> 02:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:19.030 --> 02:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
this is the access
 
02:16:22.470 --> 02:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
applied to the people who are customers
 
02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
or ca would this apply to the employer
 
02:16:27.189 --> 02:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
require its employees to wear mass
 
02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
so thank you very very much for the
 
02:16:35.190 --> 02:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
question um if i understand correctly
 
02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
you're asking if if this were to pass
 
02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
does it relate to the employees
 
02:16:40.559 --> 02:16:41.750 align:start position:0%
does it relate to the employees
and

02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
the uh the customers and the public okay
 
02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:46.559 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for the for
 
02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
assisting you with the clarification
 
02:16:50.709 --> 02:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
based on the way this is written because
 
02:16:52.629 --> 02:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
it's focused on public accommodation
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
only it is public-facing meaning
 
02:16:58.070 --> 02:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
customers of that particular business if
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
it were in employment if it was if
 
02:17:03.030 --> 02:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
employment was added here then this
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
would speak to the employees and staff
 
02:17:10.469 --> 02:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:11.910 --> 02:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:17:14.150 --> 02:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:17:16.389 --> 02:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo thank you mr
 
02:17:17.669 --> 02:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
claire and thank you for taking my
 
02:17:19.110 --> 02:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
question um
 
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
so when we're talking about medical
 
02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
devices would this be a good example of
 
02:17:27.669 --> 02:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps um
 
02:17:27.679 --> 02:17:29.429 align:start position:0%
perhaps um
not

02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:17:31.509 --> 02:17:31.519 align:start position:0%
a public accommodation
 
02:17:33.270 --> 02:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
for instance a restaurant would not be
 
02:17:34.709 --> 02:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:17:34.719 --> 02:17:35.910 align:start position:0%
able to
um

02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
allow a reasonable accommodation to a
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
person who wants to visit the restaurant
 
02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
wants to eat there
 
02:17:45.429 --> 02:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
and let's say that the restaurant has
 
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
like one of those open grills
 
02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:50.629 align:start position:0%
like one of those open grills
and

02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:51.990 --> 02:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
envision the
 
02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.509 align:start position:0%
envision the
customer

02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
customer
 
02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
wearing using an oxygen tank
 
02:17:58.629 --> 02:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
so if they
 
02:17:58.639 --> 02:18:00.469 align:start position:0%
so if they
were

02:18:00.469 --> 02:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:18:03.669 --> 02:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
not allowed to eat in the establishment
 
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh because of the inherent danger of
 
02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
oxygen with an open flame would that and
 
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
would that not be a violation of this
 
02:18:13.110 --> 02:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
bill if it were to pass
 
02:18:14.950 --> 02:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much representative
 
02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
lorenzo for the question um i am going
 
02:18:21.750 --> 02:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
to take a little stab at that however
 
02:18:24.230 --> 02:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult
 
02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:25.190 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult
because

02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:18:27.750 --> 02:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
subjective questions or
 
02:18:30.549 --> 02:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
broad hypotheticals make a moving their
 
02:18:32.709 --> 02:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
moving target right so in the
 
02:18:34.389 --> 02:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
investigative process we would ask all
 
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
of these different questions so if the
 
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
person were to file a charge saying i
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
went to this restaurant i have an oxygen
 
02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
tank and i went to open flame and they
 
02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't seat me at all
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
then we would potentially take that as a
 
02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:49.830 align:start position:0%
then we would potentially take that as a
charge

02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
charge
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
verifying that they went to the
 
02:18:52.629 --> 02:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
restaurant and and some other
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
information making sure that it meets
 
02:18:56.309 --> 02:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
the minimum standard to walk into the
 
02:18:58.629 --> 02:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
door upon further scrutiny once we
 
02:19:00.070 --> 02:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
looked at it
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
if they did not offer another seat so if
 
02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
it is by law whether it's a new
 
02:19:07.669 --> 02:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire statute or a federal statute
 
02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
that says you cannot use an oxygen tank
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
near an open flame then we would look at
 
02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
were there other places uh
 
02:19:18.790 --> 02:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
adjacent to the area that the person
 
02:19:21.349 --> 02:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
could sit now an accommodation doesn't
 
02:19:23.910 --> 02:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily afford you the exact same
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
experience as someone else but it does
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
allow you to be in the restaurant be
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
served and have the food so
 
02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
would the an accommodation in this
 
02:19:34.629 --> 02:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
scenario could potentially be a booth
 
02:19:36.389 --> 02:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
somewhere else but still enjoying the
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
food or something nearby so that they
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
could witness what everyone else is
 
02:19:42.709 --> 02:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
witnessing if it was
 
02:19:45.429 --> 02:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
if it's illegal for that person by new
 
02:19:47.669 --> 02:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire law or federal law or a
 
02:19:49.990 --> 02:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
combination thereof to be sitting next
 
02:19:52.469 --> 02:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
to an open flame now the person doesn't
 
02:19:54.550 --> 02:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
have to accept this accommodation and
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
the person could leave and the person
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
could certainly come and file a charge
 
02:19:59.110 --> 02:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
with us because they felt they were
 
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
discriminated against it is their right
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
to do so and then once we look at the um
 
02:20:06.790 --> 02:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
the parameters and look at the
 
02:20:09.510 --> 02:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
specificity of exactly what happened
 
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
then we would make a determination of
 
02:20:13.990 --> 02:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
probable cause through investigation or
 
02:20:16.230 --> 02:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
no probable cause and a no probable
 
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
cause finding in this particular example
 
02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
would say
 
02:20:22.230 --> 02:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
yes you were not able to sit next to the
 
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
open flame however the rest based on
 
02:20:27.429 --> 02:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
whatever the law is because we would
 
02:20:29.349 --> 02:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
cite that in the investigation or in the
 
02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
summary of that
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
however the restaurant did provide a
 
02:20:35.830 --> 02:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation to allow you to
 
02:20:38.870 --> 02:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
sit near adjacent somewhere close so
 
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
the experience was somewhat the same
 
02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
obviously it's not what the person
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
wanted but it was an accommodation so
 
02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
long answer to short question um and
 
02:20:49.830 --> 02:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's hard because some of these things
 
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
are moving targets because without all
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:20:56.070 --> 02:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
specifics it's it's challenging so
 
02:20:58.469 --> 02:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
with that said
 
02:21:01.349 --> 02:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
the business would hopefully be able to
 
02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
provide a reasonable accommodation so if
 
02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
the city of concord had a mass mandate
 
02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:09.990 align:start position:0%
the city of concord had a mass mandate
and

02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:12.469 --> 02:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
the business is following
 
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:21:16.150 --> 02:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
based on this then they would want they
 
02:21:17.750 --> 02:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
should be able to
 
02:21:20.710 --> 02:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
provide or they would want to provide
 
02:21:22.389 --> 02:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
a reasonable accommodation for that
 
02:21:25.110 --> 02:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
person who either cannot which if you
 
02:21:26.389 --> 02:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
cannot wear one
 
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
based on medical reasons there's already
 
02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
an exemption for that so there could be
 
02:21:32.389 --> 02:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
disability involved
 
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
so there's already an exemption for that
 
02:21:37.429 --> 02:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
if you choose not then
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
the business could say well let's forget
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
the concord mask mandate but let's say
 
02:21:43.750 --> 02:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
the business says
 
02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
either all people wear a mask or no
 
02:21:48.070 --> 02:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
people wear a mask then maybe that's the
 
02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation to not run
 
02:21:52.950 --> 02:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
afoul of this of hb
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
1490 if it were to pass
 
02:22:00.309 --> 02:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
02:22:10.630 --> 02:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
just so
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
i just want to clarify and i understand
 
02:22:14.309 --> 02:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're saying about the
 
02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
oxygen in an open flame and it's not we
 
02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
don't want you here it's
 
02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to accommodate you in
 
02:22:21.670 --> 02:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
another area
 
02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
now this bill is saying relative to
 
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
equal access if
 
02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:27.750 align:start position:0%
equal access if
so

02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:29.429 align:start position:0%
so
couldn't

02:22:29.429 --> 02:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
02:22:32.309 --> 02:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
hypothetically someone not vaccinated
 
02:22:34.469 --> 02:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
still be able to have access but yet
 
02:22:36.389 --> 02:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
have to be maybe in a different area
 
02:22:38.630 --> 02:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
like we've been doing with the you know
 
02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
no mask area or novak's area so that
 
02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
you're you're trying to compromise and
 
02:22:46.630 --> 02:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
be able to have everybody have the same
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
experience yet you might not be able to
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
be right up front in a venue you have to
 
02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
be in a different area so that everybody
 
02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
is held safe would that be
 
02:22:57.510 --> 02:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
in your opinion
 
02:23:00.389 --> 02:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
not holding you to it something that
 
02:23:03.429 --> 02:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
might be able to work this out so that
 
02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
everyone's allowed to still enjoy
 
02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:06.870 align:start position:0%
everyone's allowed to still enjoy
life

02:23:06.870 --> 02:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
life
 
02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
that is an excellent question and i
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for it um you know one of the
 
02:23:13.270 --> 02:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
things that i don't do at the commission
 
02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
is just go with my opinion
 
02:23:18.070 --> 02:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
if i had that question that you just
 
02:23:20.150 --> 02:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
asked and in my mind i think well maybe
 
02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
this is the answer if the answer that
 
02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
you proposed
 
02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
moving people to a different section to
 
02:23:28.630 --> 02:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
allow what i would then do with that is
 
02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
immediately go to my client services
 
02:23:32.150 --> 02:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative that works at the
 
02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office as it is their
 
02:23:36.550 --> 02:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility to interpret the law so
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
what they would do is we would run maybe
 
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
a scenario or two to allow us to think
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
through what the possibilities are
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
really and what we also do is is look at
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
what is the definition of reasonable
 
02:23:49.910 --> 02:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
accommodation what are the precedents
 
02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
that have happened previously with
 
02:23:55.270 --> 02:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
rulings um and interpretation of that
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
particular portion of our statute in the
 
02:23:59.349 --> 02:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
past and so we look for patterns in
 
02:23:59.359 --> 02:24:00.710 align:start position:0%
past and so we look for patterns in
practice

02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
practice
 
02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
and when we do that then we're able to
 
02:24:06.230 --> 02:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
apply all of that to this one individual
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
situation to then recognize if they do
 
02:24:11.270 --> 02:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
have a charge
 
02:24:13.270 --> 02:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
and they were discriminated against or
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
that they do not have a charge and maybe
 
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
putting them in a separate section was a
 
02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation although it
 
02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't what they initially wanted so i
 
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
would um
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
i would dare not venture into the land
 
02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
of curiosity there
 
02:24:31.270 --> 02:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
and would respectfully like to if that
 
02:24:34.150 --> 02:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
were a situation would absolutely and i
 
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
hope you feel confident in in that
 
02:24:38.230 --> 02:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
that we immediately would ask the
 
02:24:39.990 --> 02:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office uh to make
 
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
sure because it is not our job my job or
 
02:24:45.990 --> 02:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
the job of the commission to make law
 
02:24:48.469 --> 02:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
we enforce what the legislature has put
 
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
forward and if there are any questions
 
02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
any doubt hesitancy curiosity
 
02:24:56.469 --> 02:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
uncertainty can we push it here or what
 
02:24:57.910 --> 02:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
do we need to do we will go to the
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:05.429 --> 02:25:05.439 align:start position:0%
it's me representative sylvia
 
02:25:07.429 --> 02:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit more broad of a
 
02:25:13.030 --> 02:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
question um
 
02:25:14.710 --> 02:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
02:25:16.870 --> 02:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
the the work that you do
 
02:25:19.270 --> 02:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
versus if somebody is discriminated
 
02:25:20.710 --> 02:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
against feel they're discriminated
 
02:25:22.950 --> 02:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
against do they have the opportunity to
 
02:25:25.990 --> 02:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
go straight to the court and and file a
 
02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
suit for
 
02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of tortious interference or
 
02:25:31.429 --> 02:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
something in that nature
 
02:25:33.429 --> 02:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for the question
 
02:25:35.750 --> 02:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
um the way the statute is written
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
relative to public employment excuse me
 
02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:39.830 align:start position:0%
relative to public employment excuse me
employment

02:25:39.830 --> 02:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
employment
 
02:25:42.309 --> 02:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
public accommodation and housing
 
02:25:44.389 --> 02:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
you must come to the commission and you
 
02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
file your initial charge there
 
02:25:48.710 --> 02:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
should the complainant want to withdraw
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
that charge and move it to court they
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to do so and
 
02:25:54.870 --> 02:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
there's a process in our statute in our
 
02:25:56.950 --> 02:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
rules that specifies what that process
 
02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
is however in education which was added
 
02:26:03.030 --> 02:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
to our statute as of 2019 a person has
 
02:26:04.870 --> 02:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
what we would call a true choice of
 
02:26:08.230 --> 02:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
forum meaning they can file with the
 
02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
with the commission they may go to the
 
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office and file a
 
02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
charge and that would more than likely
 
02:26:15.750 --> 02:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
if it's discriminatory behavior that
 
02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
they're alleging that would be under the
 
02:26:19.429 --> 02:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
civil rights unit so they could file a
 
02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
charge with the attorney general's
 
02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
office or they may take it directly to
 
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
court that is up to
 
02:26:27.670 --> 02:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
the uh determination or the decision of
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
the complainant if they would choose to
 
02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
do that
 
02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you your depth of knowledge in
 
02:26:34.710 --> 02:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
this area is
 
02:26:34.720 --> 02:26:36.469 align:start position:0%
this area is
very

02:26:36.469 --> 02:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
amazing thank you
 
02:26:41.260 --> 02:26:41.270 align:start position:0%
i'm making diamonds over here so
 
02:26:41.270 --> 02:26:43.990 align:start position:0%
i'm making diamonds over here so
[Laughter]

02:26:43.990 --> 02:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:26:45.190 --> 02:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
any other
 
02:26:46.630 --> 02:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
questions representative horrigan do you
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
have a question um thank you you
 
02:26:50.469 --> 02:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
provided an explanation what a medical
 
02:26:53.270 --> 02:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
device is um but it where's the
 
02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
dividing life the israel between
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
medical devices and then you know
 
02:27:00.469 --> 02:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
protective equipment like helmets or for
 
02:27:01.510 --> 02:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
example where i used to work at the
 
02:27:03.270 --> 02:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
racetrack in certain areas ear
 
02:27:05.270 --> 02:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
protectors were required and
 
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
in the pits you would have to wear even
 
02:27:09.270 --> 02:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
more than just your protectors but so is
 
02:27:10.230 --> 02:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
there a
 
02:27:12.309 --> 02:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
is there a is there a line and is it a
 
02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
fuzzy one or
 
02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
a not so fuzzy one thanks
 
02:27:18.469 --> 02:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
horgan for the question
 
02:27:22.710 --> 02:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
so the definition that i provided was me
 
02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
reading from the fda's website as to
 
02:27:28.389 --> 02:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
what they consider a medical device
 
02:27:30.389 --> 02:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
and if this met legislation were to
 
02:27:32.630 --> 02:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
become law then we would look at that
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
understand what that means i mean
 
02:27:35.830 --> 02:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully there would be some additional
 
02:27:38.150 --> 02:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
clarification so that we had
 
02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
understanding of what we're looking at
 
02:27:42.870 --> 02:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
so that if a charge is filed we have
 
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
information within the statute to
 
02:27:47.910 --> 02:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
in in the definition section certainly
 
02:27:50.710 --> 02:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
to make that determination however if
 
02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
that were not afforded to us
 
02:27:54.870 --> 02:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
medical device versus personal
 
02:27:57.429 --> 02:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
protective equipment we would then as
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
i've stated before go to the attorney
 
02:28:01.349 --> 02:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
general's office and look through
 
02:28:03.429 --> 02:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
who who are the leading
 
02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh folks organizations that would make
 
02:28:07.830 --> 02:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
that determination would it be the fda
 
02:28:09.990 --> 02:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
if they are the regulatory body then we
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
would look to them we would talk to the
 
02:28:13.110 --> 02:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office and then we
 
02:28:15.030 --> 02:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
would work on what that definition would
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
be and if there are additional statutory
 
02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
changes that would need to take place to
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
include said definition then we would do
 
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
whatever the process would be to make
 
02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:25.349 align:start position:0%
whatever the process would be to make
that

02:28:25.349 --> 02:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:27.670 --> 02:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
possible if it means just adding it into
 
02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
our rules through a rules change we
 
02:28:31.510 --> 02:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
could certainly do that if it meant that
 
02:28:33.590 --> 02:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
we needed to do something in a statutory
 
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
body a statutory manner we would
 
02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
certainly seek out one of the
 
02:28:38.469 --> 02:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
professionals to assist us with that
 
02:28:38.479 --> 02:28:39.750 align:start position:0%
professionals to assist us with that
process

02:28:39.750 --> 02:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:28:40.870 --> 02:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
great thanks
 
02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:45.110 align:start position:0%
great thanks
absolutely

02:28:45.110 --> 02:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:48.389 --> 02:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
i just have one brief question and that
 
02:28:52.710 --> 02:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
is it this
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of the statute and the way it's
 
02:28:56.710 --> 02:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
interpreted it
 
02:28:59.670 --> 02:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
it talks about having equal access to
 
02:29:02.469 --> 02:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
places of public accommodation
 
02:29:06.469 --> 02:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
so that access means i'm presuming
 
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
physical access to the place and not
 
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily access to the services that
 
02:29:15.270 --> 02:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
they provide is that correct
 
02:29:18.150 --> 02:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
that is a really good question i i would
 
02:29:20.309 --> 02:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
want to circle back to
 
02:29:22.870 --> 02:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
to look at um
 
02:29:25.510 --> 02:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
to give you a very specific answer
 
02:29:27.750 --> 02:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
because it's it it feels like the
 
02:29:29.270 --> 02:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
chicken or the egg you know if you don't
 
02:29:30.630 --> 02:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
have access to the place then you don't
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
have access to the service um and so
 
02:29:38.469 --> 02:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
having a reasonable accommodation
 
02:29:40.870 --> 02:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
just in the example that
 
02:29:42.389 --> 02:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
representative de lorenzo and i were
 
02:29:42.399 --> 02:29:43.910 align:start position:0%
representative de lorenzo and i were
discussing

02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
02:29:46.230 --> 02:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
that individual with the oxygen oxygen
 
02:29:48.389 --> 02:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
tank would still have equal access to
 
02:29:50.950 --> 02:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
the restaurant
 
02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
but they would not have the same level
 
02:29:55.510 --> 02:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
of access to the area with the open
 
02:29:55.520 --> 02:29:56.469 align:start position:0%
of access to the area with the open
flame

02:29:56.469 --> 02:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
flame
 
02:29:56.479 --> 02:29:58.950 align:start position:0%
flame
so

02:29:58.950 --> 02:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:01.030 --> 02:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
i would want to
 
02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
look at that a little more closely to
 
02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
give you a more specific answer
 
02:30:07.750 --> 02:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
based on
 
02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
what's written here
 
02:30:12.550 --> 02:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't want to
 
02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
i don't want to shoot in the dark on
 
02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
that one well if i can just follow up
 
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
the the issue is this and we've heard
 
02:30:20.950 --> 02:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
from the hospital association
 
02:30:23.750 --> 02:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
it provides equal access
 
02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:24.790 align:start position:0%
it provides equal access
so

02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:30:26.150 --> 02:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
you could
 
02:30:27.910 --> 02:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
have access to
 
02:30:30.230 --> 02:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
the hospital
 
02:30:33.510 --> 02:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
but does that give you the right to
 
02:30:37.990 --> 02:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
have the services the hospital provides
 
02:30:40.870 --> 02:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
so if a doctor said i don't want to
 
02:30:42.790 --> 02:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
provide service
 
02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:43.750 align:start position:0%
provide service
to

02:30:43.750 --> 02:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:46.790 align:start position:0%
to
someone

02:30:46.790 --> 02:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:49.270 --> 02:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
does this
 
02:30:54.630 --> 02:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:57.670 --> 02:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
that is a good question because i i
 
02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
would really want to look at
 
02:31:03.110 --> 02:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
more specifically
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
the access to an accommodation
 
02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
so when you're looking at a store
 
02:31:11.270 --> 02:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
you want to have access to get into that
 
02:31:11.280 --> 02:31:12.389 align:start position:0%
you want to have access to get into that
store

02:31:12.389 --> 02:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
store
 
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
once you're in the store then
 
02:31:16.950 --> 02:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
the services that are rendered would be
 
02:31:18.950 --> 02:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
you being able to purchase whatever the
 
02:31:21.110 --> 02:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
things are in the store unless there are
 
02:31:23.270 --> 02:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
certain regulations meaning you know if
 
02:31:25.030 --> 02:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
they're cigarettes you can't you know
 
02:31:26.469 --> 02:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
purchase those unless you're a certain
 
02:31:28.790 --> 02:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
age if there are guns you can't purchase
 
02:31:30.389 --> 02:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
those at a certain age or other
 
02:31:33.349 --> 02:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
materials that have specific either
 
02:31:38.710 --> 02:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
state or federal restrictions so to be
 
02:31:41.429 --> 02:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
very specific on that answer
 
02:31:44.150 --> 02:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
again i would want to make sure if it
 
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
access to the service and
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
i would have to
 
02:31:56.389 --> 02:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
call on my my paralegal back here uh
 
02:31:58.070 --> 02:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
potentially and i could circle back and
 
02:31:59.270 --> 02:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
give you an answer if there's someone
 
02:32:00.790 --> 02:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
else i could come back up and answer
 
02:32:04.630 --> 02:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
that question more specifically um but
 
02:32:04.640 --> 02:32:05.590 align:start position:0%
that question more specifically um but
um

02:32:05.590 --> 02:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:07.750 --> 02:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd wanted i'd want to do that i
 
02:32:09.270 --> 02:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
don't wanna i don't wanna stab it in the
 
02:32:11.030 --> 02:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
dark on that
 
02:32:13.830 --> 02:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
02:32:15.429 --> 02:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
sigmund thank you for your testimony
 
02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:32:17.120 --> 02:32:51.270 align:start position:0%
thank you
victoria

02:32:51.270 --> 02:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:54.389 --> 02:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
need to turn on your microphone please
 
02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
oh the red button is on okay
 
02:32:59.990 --> 02:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh my name is victoria gullah i live in
 
02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:01.590 align:start position:0%
uh my name is victoria gullah i live in
spafford

02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
spafford
 
02:33:03.429 --> 02:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
uh i wasn't here earlier because i had
 
02:33:05.670 --> 02:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
to drop my son off at school and it's
 
02:33:07.510 --> 02:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
about an hour away
 
02:33:09.590 --> 02:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
so that's why i chose this bill to come
 
02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:10.630 align:start position:0%
so that's why i chose this bill to come
today

02:33:10.630 --> 02:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:33:12.469 --> 02:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
for public access but i've been affected
 
02:33:15.110 --> 02:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
i have lung damage from very limited
 
02:33:19.429 --> 02:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
mask wearing
 
02:33:19.439 --> 02:33:20.389 align:start position:0%
mask wearing
last

02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
more than a year ago now at the
 
02:33:23.990 --> 02:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
beginning of all this
 
02:33:25.590 --> 02:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
and i also have a son with tourette
 
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
syndrome which
 
02:33:29.349 --> 02:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
most people think of tourette's as
 
02:33:31.830 --> 02:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
something where people involuntarily
 
02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
spout out words or particularly bad
 
02:33:35.510 --> 02:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
words but for my son it's a tick
 
02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:37.030 align:start position:0%
words but for my son it's a tick
disorder

02:33:37.030 --> 02:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
and he um he's he's gonna be
 
02:33:44.389 --> 02:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
nine on one next wednesday
 
02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
and he goes through different ticks
 
02:33:48.479 --> 02:33:49.830 align:start position:0%
and he goes through different ticks
and

02:33:49.830 --> 02:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:33:53.270 --> 02:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
one that he's really into now is chewing
 
02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:54.389 align:start position:0%
one that he's really into now is chewing
so

02:33:54.389 --> 02:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:33:56.309 --> 02:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
expensive beautiful coats and sweaters
 
02:33:57.830 --> 02:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
he chews
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
his hands he chews he chews them raw
 
02:34:03.110 --> 02:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things that makes a tick
 
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
disorder worse
 
02:34:07.750 --> 02:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
is anxiety
 
02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:08.710 align:start position:0%
is anxiety
and

02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:11.990 --> 02:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
if you go through something like a cold
 
02:34:14.389 --> 02:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
we rub our noses i see lots of people
 
02:34:16.630 --> 02:34:16.640 align:start position:0%
kind of ruining the whole purpose of
 
02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
their their mask or their respirator
 
02:34:20.230 --> 02:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
because they're touching them all the
 
02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:21.270 align:start position:0%
because they're touching them all the
time

02:34:21.270 --> 02:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:22.230 align:start position:0%
time
so

02:34:22.230 --> 02:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:34:23.990 --> 02:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
you tend to touch your face more when
 
02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
you're wearing a mask and germs do get
 
02:34:27.750 --> 02:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
through them
 
02:34:29.190 --> 02:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
and now you've touched it and now you're
 
02:34:31.429 --> 02:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
touching so now you're actually taking
 
02:34:34.230 --> 02:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
your hands and spreading your germs
 
02:34:36.070 --> 02:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
well when you get a cold you're wiping
 
02:34:37.110 --> 02:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
your nose and when you're an
 
02:34:38.309 --> 02:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
eight-year-old little boy or a
 
02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
six-year-old boy
 
02:34:43.270 --> 02:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
you can't really help doing that and the
 
02:34:46.230 --> 02:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
more you do these things when you have a
 
02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
tick disorder that becomes your new tick
 
02:34:51.429 --> 02:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
so he's had different tics where
 
02:34:53.429 --> 02:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
he might shake his hands like this he
 
02:34:55.270 --> 02:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
jump up and down and they come with
 
02:34:58.150 --> 02:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
excitement anxiety christmas lots of
 
02:34:59.750 --> 02:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
jumping we went to the circus he almost
 
02:35:01.590 --> 02:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
killed me jumping on me
 
02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:02.469 align:start position:0%
killed me jumping on me
um

02:35:02.469 --> 02:35:02.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:02.479 --> 02:35:03.510 align:start position:0%
um
it's

02:35:03.510 --> 02:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
this is all part of a tick disorder it's
 
02:35:08.309 --> 02:35:08.319 align:start position:0%
also he has um it's almost like an
 
02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
oppositional defiance thing where you
 
02:35:11.750 --> 02:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
say marco don't do that
 
02:35:13.270 --> 02:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
don't touch that and he touches it
 
02:35:15.590 --> 02:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
immediately he can't help it it's that's
 
02:35:17.830 --> 02:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
part of the tick disorder
 
02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:18.870 align:start position:0%
part of the tick disorder
and

02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:19.990 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:35:19.990 --> 02:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:21.910 --> 02:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
you know it's really fun having a kid
 
02:35:23.270 --> 02:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
who can't keep his hands out of his
 
02:35:26.070 --> 02:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
mouth so when he gets a cold and he's
 
02:35:28.469 --> 02:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
rubbing his nose that's where the tick
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
goes so if he used to be
 
02:35:32.710 --> 02:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
doing this with his arms and he gets a
 
02:35:35.590 --> 02:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
cold now his hand is here and he's
 
02:35:38.150 --> 02:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
rubbing his nose he's chewing
 
02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:39.110 align:start position:0%
rubbing his nose he's chewing
um

02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
he's in my car like leaning on the side
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
of the car
 
02:35:45.110 --> 02:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
with his nose on it
 
02:35:47.750 --> 02:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
so when you put a mask
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
on top of that
 
02:35:52.550 --> 02:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
it creates that feeling
 
02:35:55.590 --> 02:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
and now he wants to touch his face
 
02:35:57.590 --> 02:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
was he doing this in the summer no
 
02:35:57.600 --> 02:35:58.790 align:start position:0%
was he doing this in the summer no
because

02:35:58.790 --> 02:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:36:00.870 --> 02:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
he doesn't have colds in the summer
 
02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
you're not wearing a collar around your
 
02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
mouth you're not wearing a coat that you
 
02:36:07.349 --> 02:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
zip up like this you're not wearing a
 
02:36:11.349 --> 02:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
balaclava to ski that's on your face
 
02:36:11.359 --> 02:36:13.590 align:start position:0%
balaclava to ski that's on your face
so

02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:36:15.429 --> 02:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
bringing this child out in public i've
 
02:36:17.190 --> 02:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
never put a mask on him and i won't put
 
02:36:19.110 --> 02:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
a mask on him
 
02:36:22.150 --> 02:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
it increases the anxiety it increases
 
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
the disorder
 
02:36:26.309 --> 02:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
and we work very hard with him and he's
 
02:36:28.309 --> 02:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
a bit young to do the cognitive
 
02:36:30.469 --> 02:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
behavioral therapy like i'll say okay
 
02:36:33.270 --> 02:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
take your hand down try to tap your leg
 
02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
do this instead but he's chewing his
 
02:36:37.750 --> 02:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
hands he's chewed his hands raw
 
02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:38.630 align:start position:0%
hands he's chewed his hands raw
like

02:36:38.630 --> 02:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
practically bleeding
 
02:36:43.750 --> 02:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
as part of this tick disorder
 
02:36:47.510 --> 02:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
and he's in a homeschool pod
 
02:36:50.710 --> 02:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
because he's denied his public education
 
02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:36:54.710 --> 02:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
at a state charter school
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
the school denied
 
02:36:59.110 --> 02:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
pushed me off pushed me off
 
02:37:02.389 --> 02:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
and as the previous woman testified
 
02:37:04.950 --> 02:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
his pediatric neurologist at dartmouth
 
02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
in your network
 
02:37:09.429 --> 02:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
is too afraid
 
02:37:11.110 --> 02:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
02:37:13.750 --> 02:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
no no this is necessary
 
02:37:15.670 --> 02:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
this is necessary
 
02:37:18.790 --> 02:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
because these hospitals are leading the
 
02:37:18.800 --> 02:37:20.950 align:start position:0%
because these hospitals are leading the
discrimination

02:37:20.950 --> 02:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
02:37:23.190 --> 02:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
and they are leading
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
improper care their leading
 
02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:27.030 align:start position:0%
improper care their leading
disinformation

02:37:27.030 --> 02:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
disinformation
 
02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
a mask
 
02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
where is it that one does nothing
 
02:37:33.990 --> 02:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
you talk to any industrial hygienist
 
02:37:35.590 --> 02:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
that mask does nothing he's got it goes
 
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
right out the sides so these ladies on
 
02:37:39.750 --> 02:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
each side of him they're getting a plume
 
02:37:42.389 --> 02:37:42.399 align:start position:0%
of his aerosols
 
02:37:45.990 --> 02:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
85 to 95 percent of covid is distributed
 
02:37:48.389 --> 02:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
in aerosols it comes through
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
your bottom end in the toilet so you go
 
02:37:54.309 --> 02:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
into the bathroom with your mask on
 
02:37:56.870 --> 02:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
and you go into a toilet plume that is a
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
thing look it up toilet plume
 
02:38:01.590 --> 02:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
and you're going into the aerosols that
 
02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
came through your gi tract
 
02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
and now you have it stuck to your mask
 
02:38:07.590 --> 02:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
and now you're going to inhale that
 
02:38:10.950 --> 02:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
and it's going to come through your mask
 
02:38:14.550 --> 02:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
or it gets trapped in your mask
 
02:38:16.389 --> 02:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
so these hospital associations they need
 
02:38:17.910 --> 02:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
to be called out they're not treating
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
people properly and they're lying
 
02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
about masks you you can testify but you
 
02:38:25.429 --> 02:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
don't need to make it personal that's no
 
02:38:27.750 --> 02:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
it is very personal
 
02:38:30.150 --> 02:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
it is very personal
 
02:38:32.150 --> 02:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
my lungs have been injured by these
 
02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:33.830 align:start position:0%
my lungs have been injured by these
masks

02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
masks
 
02:38:36.150 --> 02:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
and like i say i'm a stay-at-home mom
 
02:38:37.990 --> 02:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
i didn't have to wear them often i
 
02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
happened to have a little seasonal
 
02:38:40.950 --> 02:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
allergy a little cold when the whole
 
02:38:42.389 --> 02:38:42.399 align:start position:0%
cove had started
 
02:38:42.399 --> 02:38:43.190 align:start position:0%
cove had started
so

02:38:43.190 --> 02:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:38:46.230 --> 02:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know wear my stupid mask i had some
 
02:38:48.150 --> 02:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
a box of masks at home from when my
 
02:38:49.910 --> 02:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
daughter over here was an infant and i
 
02:38:51.349 --> 02:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
had a bad cold
 
02:38:51.359 --> 02:38:52.150 align:start position:0%
had a bad cold
and

02:38:52.150 --> 02:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:54.630 --> 02:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
you see people you know i lived in new
 
02:38:56.230 --> 02:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
york city many years i'm from new
 
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'm a native
 
02:38:59.510 --> 02:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
and you see people when they're sick
 
02:39:00.550 --> 02:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
wearing them on the subway and
 
02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
everything your reaction on the subway
 
02:39:05.270 --> 02:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
is to lift up your scarf
 
02:39:07.830 --> 02:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
and um you know you hold the pole on the
 
02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
subway with a glove
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
you are pushed in that subway in
 
02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:12.710 align:start position:0%
you are pushed in that subway in
manhattan

02:39:12.710 --> 02:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
manhattan
 
02:39:14.550 --> 02:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
and you feel you smell people's bad
 
02:39:16.389 --> 02:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
breath all right that's how crowded the
 
02:39:18.630 --> 02:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
subway is so you're like this
 
02:39:19.990 --> 02:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:39:23.349 --> 02:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't do anything you feel that
 
02:39:25.590 --> 02:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
you're doing something you're not doing
 
02:39:28.230 --> 02:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
anything you all have gaps all of you
 
02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
have gaps if you can take your hair
 
02:39:32.230 --> 02:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
take your hair pull it out of your head
 
02:39:34.389 --> 02:39:34.399 align:start position:0%
can you push it down between your nose
 
02:39:37.110 --> 02:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
and your face if you can you are not
 
02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:38.389 align:start position:0%
and your face if you can you are not
protected

02:39:38.389 --> 02:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
protected
 
02:39:40.630 --> 02:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
and you're not protecting other people
 
02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:41.750 align:start position:0%
and you're not protecting other people
now

02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:39:43.270 --> 02:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
this is where this goes with public
 
02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:46.230 align:start position:0%
this is where this goes with public
accommodation

02:39:46.230 --> 02:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:48.710 --> 02:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
places are forcing you to wear these
 
02:39:51.110 --> 02:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
things that provide
 
02:39:53.670 --> 02:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
no protection and people are being lied
 
02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:54.710 align:start position:0%
no protection and people are being lied
to

02:39:54.710 --> 02:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:39:56.790 --> 02:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
and they're being lied to
 
02:39:58.389 --> 02:39:58.399 align:start position:0%
by the hospitals
 
02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
the hospitals are not industrial
 
02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.389 align:start position:0%
the hospitals are not industrial
hygienists

02:40:02.389 --> 02:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
hygienists
 
02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
they hire them to teach their surgeons
 
02:40:07.510 --> 02:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
how to properly use a mask do you know
 
02:40:09.349 --> 02:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
that surgeons are told
 
02:40:11.590 --> 02:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
when they're wearing a procedure mask
 
02:40:13.750 --> 02:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
not to turn their head when they clear
 
02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
their throat or have to do a little
 
02:40:17.990 --> 02:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
cough so if you're doing surgery
 
02:40:20.469 --> 02:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
you don't turn why because if you turn
 
02:40:23.269 --> 02:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
the plume comes out the side
 
02:40:24.550 --> 02:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:40:25.990 --> 02:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
so this is what this hospital
 
02:40:28.389 --> 02:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
association person should know
 
02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
and i can't get a letter from a
 
02:40:33.510 --> 02:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
pediatric neurologist who himself i
 
02:40:34.870 --> 02:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
think actually has tourette's because he
 
02:40:35.910 --> 02:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
was a little
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
i could see him kind of control his and
 
02:40:40.550 --> 02:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
he was a lovely man he was so
 
02:40:42.389 --> 02:40:42.399 align:start position:0%
lovely we met with two different
 
02:40:44.710 --> 02:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
pediatric neurologists one retired in
 
02:40:46.389 --> 02:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
august before all the mandates you
 
02:40:48.389 --> 02:40:48.399 align:start position:0%
wonder about that
 
02:40:50.630 --> 02:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
why would he retire when
 
02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
children need psychiatric help
 
02:40:55.110 --> 02:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
when they're
 
02:40:55.120 --> 02:40:56.309 align:start position:0%
when they're
being

02:40:56.309 --> 02:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:40:57.510 --> 02:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
when the hospitals here overflowing
 
02:41:01.990 --> 02:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's an issue in new hampshire we read
 
02:41:03.510 --> 02:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
about that on the front pages you're all
 
02:41:05.429 --> 02:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
well aware why would a pediatric
 
02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
neurologist at dartmouth
 
02:41:10.150 --> 02:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
why would he retire in august before the
 
02:41:13.990 --> 02:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination mandates why think about it
 
02:41:16.230 --> 02:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
and the other one lovely i mean lovely
 
02:41:18.630 --> 02:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
people spent so much time with us giving
 
02:41:20.150 --> 02:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
us kind of help and guidance but still
 
02:41:22.790 --> 02:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
says why doesn't he try wearing the mask
 
02:41:24.790 --> 02:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
what makes it worse
 
02:41:26.550 --> 02:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
i'm his mother i'm with him all the time
 
02:41:28.469 --> 02:41:28.479 align:start position:0%
i'm with this child all the time i know
 
02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:35.590 --> 02:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:41:36.870 --> 02:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
and he can't go to school in new
 
02:41:38.790 --> 02:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire at a public charter school
 
02:41:40.870 --> 02:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
because these people put us off oh you
 
02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
have to do a 401 do this do with that
 
02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
and you're making all these calls you go
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
to the district and they're like oh well
 
02:41:48.550 --> 02:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh that's not a learning disability it's
 
02:41:50.790 --> 02:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
a physical disability if i do this that
 
02:41:51.990 --> 02:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
oh you have to have a meeting with all
 
02:41:53.750 --> 02:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
these people well i can't wear a mask at
 
02:41:55.510 --> 02:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
your meeting they won't meet with me
 
02:41:56.830 --> 02:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
well you can't do this can you do a zoom
 
02:41:59.990 --> 02:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
meeting no you don't hear back so forget
 
02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:01.190 align:start position:0%
meeting no you don't hear back so forget
them

02:42:01.190 --> 02:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:42:04.389 --> 02:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
now they're sending emails telling lying
 
02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
saying that children need to be
 
02:42:08.230 --> 02:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinated in the school
 
02:42:10.230 --> 02:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
so that they can help spread stop spread
 
02:42:12.309 --> 02:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
the disease the vaccination does not
 
02:42:14.790 --> 02:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
stop the spread in fact it promotes the
 
02:42:14.800 --> 02:42:15.910 align:start position:0%
stop the spread in fact it promotes the
spread

02:42:15.910 --> 02:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
spread
 
02:42:18.389 --> 02:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
why don't you look at your data and see
 
02:42:20.790 --> 02:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
that every time a vaccination rolls out
 
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
that age group cova cases spike do you
 
02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
know why because the vaccine suppresses
 
02:42:29.190 --> 02:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
your cd8 and cd4 and natural killer
 
02:42:31.429 --> 02:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
cells so for two to three weeks after
 
02:42:33.349 --> 02:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
your vaccination and booster you are
 
02:42:35.190 --> 02:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
particularly susceptible to getting what
 
02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:39.429 align:start position:0%
particularly susceptible to getting what
covid

02:42:39.429 --> 02:42:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:39.439 --> 02:42:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:42:41.510 --> 02:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:42:42.710 --> 02:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
you know we've heard about the vaccine
 
02:42:44.550 --> 02:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
injuries my son has tourette's it might
 
02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
be from one of the vaccines i only know
 
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
now that tourette's and tic disorders
 
02:42:53.269 --> 02:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
are one of the many disorders that can
 
02:42:54.790 --> 02:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
happen after
 
02:42:56.950 --> 02:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccinations and my son i
 
02:42:58.790 --> 02:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
spaced them too i thought oh you know
 
02:43:00.790 --> 02:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
you get nervous as a mom right
 
02:43:02.710 --> 02:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
and you hear all this stuff and you know
 
02:43:02.720 --> 02:43:03.750 align:start position:0%
and you hear all this stuff and you know
that

02:43:03.750 --> 02:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:43:06.230 --> 02:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
autism is linked even if the cdc tries
 
02:43:07.590 --> 02:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
to lie about that and they literally
 
02:43:10.550 --> 02:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
shredded the data on that
 
02:43:13.030 --> 02:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
they're full of lies they all are
 
02:43:17.510 --> 02:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:19.349 --> 02:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
and it's inappropriate it's not
 
02:43:22.710 --> 02:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
inappropriate it must be said it must be
 
02:43:24.630 --> 02:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
said if you could just focus your
 
02:43:28.070 --> 02:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
testimony on the legislation itself yes
 
02:43:31.269 --> 02:43:31.279 align:start position:0%
so all of these things
 
02:43:33.110 --> 02:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
where this vaccination that they're
 
02:43:33.120 --> 02:43:34.870 align:start position:0%
where this vaccination that they're
requiring

02:43:34.870 --> 02:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
02:43:37.910 --> 02:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
for public accommodation can you go to
 
02:43:41.190 --> 02:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
crotchet mountain ski area on when it's
 
02:43:42.790 --> 02:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
five below zero
 
02:43:45.670 --> 02:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
can you go inside and get hot chocolate
 
02:43:48.230 --> 02:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
no you cannot you need a vaccination
 
02:43:51.030 --> 02:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
pass to do that they're supposed to have
 
02:43:54.150 --> 02:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
a little window where you can go up
 
02:43:59.990 --> 02:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:01.990 --> 02:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
is the window open no because they don't
 
02:44:04.389 --> 02:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
have enough employees why because they
 
02:44:06.469 --> 02:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
require vaccination to be employed there
 
02:44:11.830 --> 02:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:14.950 --> 02:44:14.960 align:start position:0%

02:44:45.429 --> 02:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
police last year
 
02:44:47.190 --> 02:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
me as the official no i'm not gonna be

inside but i can't go in the lodge and
 
02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
get a hot chocolate for my child
 
02:45:05.830 --> 02:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's discrimination
 
02:45:08.150 --> 02:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's discrimination against the healthy
 
02:45:11.110 --> 02:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
my vitamin d level is 70 nanograms per
 
02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:12.469 align:start position:0%
my vitamin d level is 70 nanograms per
milliliter

02:45:12.469 --> 02:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
milliliter
 
02:45:15.030 --> 02:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty much immune to
 
02:45:18.070 --> 02:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
at least delta and the in the beta and
 
02:45:19.110 --> 02:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
the alpha
 
02:45:21.030 --> 02:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
cova disease
 
02:45:24.150 --> 02:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
omicron kind of gets everyone i guess
 
02:45:26.070 --> 02:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
if you ever heard that do you hear why
 
02:45:27.990 --> 02:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
aren't these hospitals associations
 
02:45:29.910 --> 02:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
telling everybody to get their vitamin d
 
02:45:31.110 --> 02:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
levels up
 
02:45:32.950 --> 02:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
they're not i have 20 something emails
 
02:45:34.469 --> 02:45:34.479 align:start position:0%
from dartmouth hitchcock yeah if you can
 
02:45:35.590 --> 02:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
again just
 
02:45:37.269 --> 02:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
this is this is part of the public
 
02:45:39.510 --> 02:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
accommodation they are not they are
 
02:45:43.750 --> 02:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
discriminating against healthy people
 
02:45:45.830 --> 02:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
if you get the vaccine after you've had
 
02:45:49.190 --> 02:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
covet you ruin your natural immunity
 
02:45:51.110 --> 02:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
and it's dangerous
 
02:45:52.870 --> 02:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
to your immune system
 
02:45:54.309 --> 02:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
you will damage your immune system and
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
make your immune system susceptible to
 
02:45:59.349 --> 02:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
other things um all kinds of immuno
 
02:46:01.190 --> 02:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
they're still finding out because they
 
02:46:02.790 --> 02:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
didn't allow these vaccines to get
 
02:46:05.110 --> 02:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
tested still under emergency use you go
 
02:46:06.550 --> 02:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
oh it's approved
 
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
co-minardis approved is that available
 
02:46:10.870 --> 02:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
here it is not
 
02:46:13.990 --> 02:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
you cannot get the fda approved vaccine
 
02:46:15.190 --> 02:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
so you
 
02:46:17.269 --> 02:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
by these businesses through their
 
02:46:19.510 --> 02:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
coveted fascism working with different
 
02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:21.190 align:start position:0%
coveted fascism working with different
administrations

02:46:21.190 --> 02:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
administrations
 
02:46:23.110 --> 02:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
to get their
 
02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
vax pass through so that you can get
 
02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
into the chinese social credit system
 
02:46:28.389 --> 02:46:28.399 align:start position:0%
which is what it is it's not really
 
02:46:30.070 --> 02:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
about a vaccine
 
02:46:32.790 --> 02:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
no it needs to be sad

that show they work representative
 
02:47:35.840 --> 02:47:37.349 align:start position:0%

guy at the co-op and keen he's wearing
 
02:48:44.309 --> 02:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
the study just came out he's wearing the
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
gator style mask that shows that they
 
02:48:48.309 --> 02:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
actually nebulizes the droplets into
 
02:48:50.070 --> 02:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
smaller droplets
 
02:48:51.670 --> 02:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
and he's wearing his stupid gator which
 
02:48:54.070 --> 02:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
would make his droplets worse
 
02:48:56.469 --> 02:48:56.479 align:start position:0%
and he's pushing me out i couldn't even
 
02:49:00.870 --> 02:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:02.309 --> 02:49:02.319 align:start position:0%

those warm days and my son i won't cover
 
02:49:46.150 --> 02:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
his mouth we're outside so you can sit
 
02:49:48.469 --> 02:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
at picnic tables and eat with no mask
 
02:49:50.469 --> 02:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
but you can't go in the line i had they
 
02:49:51.990 --> 02:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't let me on the left they called
 
02:49:53.590 --> 02:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
i said fine call the police the police
 
02:49:55.190 --> 02:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
at a police escort at a son of me with
 
02:49:57.830 --> 02:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
my eight-year-old who loves police
 
02:49:59.830 --> 02:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
and he's crying and the ski patrol lady
 
02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
goes see you made him cry and he goes no
 
02:50:04.710 --> 02:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
you made me cry
 
02:50:05.990 --> 02:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
because they ruined him and then they
 
02:50:07.510 --> 02:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
revoked my past i should have done more
 
02:50:10.389 --> 02:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
about that but you know that this is the
 
02:50:12.389 --> 02:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
discrimination that's out there you want
 
02:50:14.469 --> 02:50:14.479 align:start position:0%
examples i've been pushed out of stores
 
02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
i've had a police escort with my
 
02:50:16.870 --> 02:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
eight-year-old because i won't put a
 
02:50:21.190 --> 02:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:23.830 --> 02:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
and again if you want your mask to work
 
02:50:25.190 --> 02:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
they're not if you can put a hair
 
02:50:27.110 --> 02:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
through your mask it's not working if
 
02:50:29.190 --> 02:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
you want protection get your vitamin d
 
02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:30.710 align:start position:0%
you want protection get your vitamin d
tested

thank you for coming today thank you for
 
02:50:43.030 --> 02:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:55.429 --> 02:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:56.950 --> 02:50:56.960 align:start position:0%

02:51:04.710 --> 02:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
02:51:07.429 --> 02:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
it really is about discrimination
 
02:51:09.429 --> 02:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
we've heard some
 
02:51:11.190 --> 02:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
very emotional testimony from the
 
02:51:13.510 --> 02:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
previous speaker
 
02:51:15.750 --> 02:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just address some of the
 
02:51:19.190 --> 02:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
questions uh comments that were
 
02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
preceded us
 
02:51:22.309 --> 02:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
preceded me
 
02:51:23.830 --> 02:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
one of them was
 
02:51:26.150 --> 02:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
in regards to accommodations
 
02:51:29.349 --> 02:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
would it be okay if
 
02:51:31.990 --> 02:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
a venue decided that they could create a
 
02:51:35.110 --> 02:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
special place for those who
 
02:51:37.990 --> 02:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
did not have a vaccine passport maybe
 
02:51:41.429 --> 02:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:41.439 --> 02:51:42.630 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:51:42.630 --> 02:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:51:44.790 --> 02:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
in itself is discrimination it goes back
 
02:51:46.710 --> 02:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
to the separate but equal but it's not
 
02:51:49.429 --> 02:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
really equal because you're creating a
 
02:51:51.269 --> 02:51:51.279 align:start position:0%
spot for somebody
 
02:51:53.429 --> 02:51:53.439 align:start position:0%
and if you don't have to go very far
 
02:51:55.590 --> 02:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
back to remember places where
 
02:51:57.750 --> 02:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh yeah it will accommodate you but it
 
02:51:59.429 --> 02:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
has to be
 
02:52:03.429 --> 02:52:03.439 align:start position:0%
in the back alley after dark or
 
02:52:05.990 --> 02:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
at a water fountain around the corner or
 
02:52:08.550 --> 02:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
at the back of the bus so it's about
 
02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:11.910 align:start position:0%
at the back of the bus so it's about
discrimination

02:52:11.910 --> 02:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:11.920 --> 02:52:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:52:12.830 --> 02:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
other thing i would like to address is
 
02:52:16.640 --> 02:52:18.630 align:start position:0%
other thing i would like to address is
that

02:52:18.630 --> 02:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:52:21.429 --> 02:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
four-letter f word again i'm going to
 
02:52:24.070 --> 02:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
say it out loud fear
 
02:52:26.469 --> 02:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
as an unvaccinated
 
02:52:29.110 --> 02:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
physician i would like to
 
02:52:32.309 --> 02:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
let you know that i am not
 
02:52:35.910 --> 02:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:35.920 --> 02:52:38.469 align:start position:0%
 
evil

02:52:38.469 --> 02:52:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:38.479 --> 02:52:40.230 align:start position:0%
 
ability

02:52:40.230 --> 02:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
ability
 
02:52:40.240 --> 02:52:41.590 align:start position:0%
ability
special

02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
special
 
02:52:44.389 --> 02:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
ability to infect others
 
02:52:46.950 --> 02:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
because i'm unvaccinated
 
02:52:50.710 --> 02:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:53.510 --> 02:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's clear that those who have been
 
02:52:56.389 --> 02:52:56.399 align:start position:0%
vaccinated versus unvaccinated have the
 
02:52:59.190 --> 02:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
same viral load can spread the disease
 
02:53:01.190 --> 02:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
vaccines are failing
 
02:53:01.200 --> 02:53:03.830 align:start position:0%
vaccines are failing
incredibly

02:53:03.830 --> 02:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
incredibly
 
02:53:05.670 --> 02:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
but the fear is there we want to get
 
02:53:08.710 --> 02:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
everyone vaccinated
 
02:53:11.910 --> 02:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
this is not a
 
02:53:15.670 --> 02:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic of the unvaccinated
 
02:53:18.630 --> 02:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
we've heard that drilled down so many
 
02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:20.950 align:start position:0%
we've heard that drilled down so many
times

02:53:20.950 --> 02:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
times
 
02:53:23.110 --> 02:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
in order for put the pressure on people
 
02:53:25.510 --> 02:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
to get vaccinated
 
02:53:27.670 --> 02:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
and today
 
02:53:29.830 --> 02:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
we hear the pressure get vaccinated get
 
02:53:31.750 --> 02:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
it vaccinated
 
02:53:33.349 --> 02:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
why what is the purpose it's pretty
 
02:53:35.510 --> 02:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
clear vaccine's not working what
 
02:53:37.510 --> 02:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
ulterior motive is it to have people
 
02:53:37.520 --> 02:53:39.349 align:start position:0%
ulterior motive is it to have people
vaccinated

02:53:39.349 --> 02:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
02:53:42.070 --> 02:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
as safe and effective believe me
 
02:53:46.150 --> 02:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:47.190 --> 02:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
i spoke to the
 
02:53:47.200 --> 02:53:48.469 align:start position:0%
i spoke to the
[Music]

02:53:48.469 --> 02:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:53:50.150 --> 02:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
specifics of the bill in my previous
 
02:53:52.389 --> 02:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
testimony and that relates to
 
02:53:55.349 --> 02:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
accommodations that
 
02:53:55.359 --> 02:53:58.309 align:start position:0%
accommodations that
may

02:53:58.309 --> 02:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:00.070 --> 02:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
discriminate against
 
02:54:03.190 --> 02:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
people like me um
 
02:54:08.230 --> 02:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
and i'll repeat them just for this
 
02:54:11.429 --> 02:54:11.439 align:start position:0%
specific bill that there is a local
 
02:54:15.190 --> 02:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
venue that requires uh people to come in
 
02:54:17.990 --> 02:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
on a special night we'll give you food
 
02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:19.030 align:start position:0%
on a special night we'll give you food
and

02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:21.910 --> 02:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
bring your pass your passports with you
 
02:54:24.070 --> 02:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
your vaccine passports
 
02:54:26.630 --> 02:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
and i use that term loosely but um a
 
02:54:28.550 --> 02:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
vaccination card is nothing more than a
 
02:54:31.429 --> 02:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
proxy for a vaccine passport and where
 
02:54:33.590 --> 02:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
are we headed with a vaccine passport or
 
02:54:35.830 --> 02:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
any kind of passport as far as privacy
 
02:54:35.840 --> 02:54:37.750 align:start position:0%
any kind of passport as far as privacy
goes

02:54:37.750 --> 02:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
goes
 
02:54:39.590 --> 02:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
to me that's
 
02:54:43.910 --> 02:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:47.190 --> 02:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination is what it is
 
02:54:50.790 --> 02:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to also comment on
 
02:54:52.630 --> 02:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
just personal experience about the
 
02:54:56.469 --> 02:54:56.479 align:start position:0%
discrimination um it relates loosely uh
 
02:54:59.429 --> 02:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
and not directly to the
 
02:55:01.990 --> 02:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
to the nature of the bill but i do have
 
02:55:04.389 --> 02:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
a family member who was uh
 
02:55:07.670 --> 02:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
was let go of their job
 
02:55:10.710 --> 02:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
because they refused to have a man
 
02:55:13.830 --> 02:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate was imposed on by his
 
02:55:16.870 --> 02:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
company healthcare company
 
02:55:19.590 --> 02:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
social worker
 
02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:21.910 align:start position:0%
social worker
he

02:55:21.910 --> 02:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:24.710 --> 02:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
my child decided not to get the vaccine
 
02:55:26.469 --> 02:55:26.479 align:start position:0%
his choice
 
02:55:28.630 --> 02:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
and he had no the
 
02:55:29.910 --> 02:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
the company did not have any
 
02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:31.670 align:start position:0%
the company did not have any
accommodations

02:55:31.670 --> 02:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
accommodations
 
02:55:33.510 --> 02:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
for him to get weekly testing they did
 
02:55:35.269 --> 02:55:35.279 align:start position:0%
not allow that
 
02:55:39.269 --> 02:55:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:41.510 --> 02:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
and here's more discrimination
 
02:55:43.830 --> 02:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
if he has to take a test every week then
 
02:55:46.070 --> 02:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
everyone has to take a test
 
02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:47.110 align:start position:0%
everyone has to take a test
if

02:55:47.110 --> 02:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:55:49.110 --> 02:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
he has to wear a mask everyone has to
 
02:55:51.349 --> 02:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
wear a mask this is discrimination
 
02:55:53.030 --> 02:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's clear this is
 
02:55:54.790 --> 02:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination there's no other way to
 
02:55:57.269 --> 02:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
see it as that
 
02:55:59.910 --> 02:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
go go back a few months where we had
 
02:56:04.309 --> 02:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:08.150 --> 02:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
those who are unvaccinated
 
02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
must wear a mask to enter the store
 
02:56:12.790 --> 02:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
if you've had a vaccine
 
02:56:15.670 --> 02:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
you're a special class come on in you
 
02:56:17.750 --> 02:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
don't need a mask
 
02:56:20.389 --> 02:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
that's discrimination especially when we
 
02:56:23.670 --> 02:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
know that the spread of the virus
 
02:56:26.230 --> 02:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
is no different
 
02:56:27.990 --> 02:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
from me giving it to you or you giving
 
02:56:29.269 --> 02:56:29.279 align:start position:0%
it to me
 
02:56:31.429 --> 02:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
we're all the virus is gonna virus this
 
02:56:33.510 --> 02:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
is what it does you know no one's
 
02:56:36.070 --> 02:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
especially immune to viruses
 
02:56:40.309 --> 02:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
in any particular way that we know of
 
02:56:44.469 --> 02:56:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh so again another story about
 
02:56:46.550 --> 02:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
discriminatory practice i have a niece
 
02:56:48.389 --> 02:56:48.399 align:start position:0%
who is a
 
02:56:50.790 --> 02:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
oncologist at a large
 
02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:52.389 align:start position:0%
oncologist at a large
massachusetts

02:56:52.389 --> 02:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
02:56:52.399 --> 02:56:55.349 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
healthcare

02:56:55.349 --> 02:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
healthcare
 
02:56:58.070 --> 02:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
provider that had to leave her job
 
02:57:00.550 --> 02:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
despite submitting a religious exemption
 
02:57:02.950 --> 02:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
that was not accepted
 
02:57:04.710 --> 02:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
she with
 
02:57:04.720 --> 02:57:04.890 align:start position:0%
she with
the

02:57:04.890 --> 02:57:04.900 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:57:04.900 --> 02:57:06.870 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

02:57:06.870 --> 02:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:57:09.030 --> 02:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
her free will was
 
02:57:10.950 --> 02:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
in her in her belief was that she was
 
02:57:13.190 --> 02:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
not going to get the vaccine because of
 
02:57:15.190 --> 02:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
the obvious dangers that have been
 
02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:17.510 align:start position:0%
the obvious dangers that have been
reported

02:57:17.510 --> 02:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
reported
 
02:57:19.910 --> 02:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
not not widely obviously because still a
 
02:57:22.389 --> 02:57:22.399 align:start position:0%
lot of people are
 
02:57:24.630 --> 02:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
uninformed i would say i wouldn't say
 
02:57:28.710 --> 02:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:30.469 --> 02:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
she had to leave and now she's having to
 
02:57:34.870 --> 02:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
move to montana with her family
 
02:57:37.670 --> 02:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
so again it boils down to discrimination
 
02:57:40.150 --> 02:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how else uh to say it
 
02:57:42.870 --> 02:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
but this this is a discriminatory
 
02:57:45.190 --> 02:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
practice if we allow
 
02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:47.110 align:start position:0%
practice if we allow
public

02:57:47.110 --> 02:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:57:49.030 --> 02:57:49.040 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
02:58:07.110 --> 02:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:09.190 --> 02:58:09.200 align:start position:0%

02:58:18.950 --> 02:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
respond to an earlier question but ms
 
02:58:20.230 --> 02:58:20.240 align:start position:0%

and today i bring to you house bill 1343
 
04:02:25.750 --> 04:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
it is a bill which creates a pilot

it is a bill which creates a pilot
program

04:02:27.030 --> 04:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:02:28.790 --> 04:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
to determine whether under limited
 
04:02:31.910 --> 04:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances non-attorneys may provide
 
04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
representation to litigants who are
 
04:02:36.229 --> 04:02:36.239 align:start position:0%

courts
 
04:02:39.189 --> 04:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
in particular this bill would allow
 
04:02:41.910 --> 04:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
qualified paralegals working under the
 
04:02:44.469 --> 04:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
authority of a licensed attorney to
 
04:02:46.630 --> 04:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
represent clients in certain family

04:02:53.830 --> 04:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
but just by way of background

up until the 1980s virtually all

litigants
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
in divorce and custody matters were
 
04:03:01.030 --> 04:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
represented by council
 
04:03:03.349 --> 04:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
but for a variety of reasons probably
 
04:03:06.309 --> 04:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
most prominently the cost of attorneys
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
the trend of self-representation
 
04:03:08.399 --> 04:03:10.150 align:start position:0%
the trend of self-representation
developed

04:03:10.150 --> 04:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
developed
 
04:03:12.870 --> 04:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
now in our circuit court
 
04:03:14.710 --> 04:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
eighty to ninety percent of the people
 
04:03:17.189 --> 04:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
who appear in the family division are
 
04:03:17.199 --> 04:03:19.349 align:start position:0%
who appear in the family division are
unrepresented

04:03:19.349 --> 04:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
unrepresented
 
04:03:21.670 --> 04:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
the court has worked hard to accommodate
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
this trend
 
04:03:27.030 --> 04:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
it has established mediation programs
 
04:03:28.710 --> 04:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
and has attempted to make the legal
 
04:03:30.630 --> 04:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
process as understandable and as
 
04:03:33.590 --> 04:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
user-friendly as possible
 
04:03:36.630 --> 04:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
but still there is no substitute for
 
04:03:39.750 --> 04:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
legal representation
 
04:03:41.830 --> 04:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
even if you go on the court website as i
 
04:03:43.590 --> 04:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
did earlier today you'll see that the
 
04:03:43.600 --> 04:03:44.630 align:start position:0%
did earlier today you'll see that the
court

04:03:44.630 --> 04:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
court
 
04:03:47.030 --> 04:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
tells people that
 
04:03:49.750 --> 04:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
if at all possible they should receive
 
04:03:53.269 --> 04:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
and obtain representation
 
04:03:55.830 --> 04:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
and why is that important
 
04:03:57.750 --> 04:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
unrepresented parties are clearly
 
04:04:01.030 --> 04:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged when the other party has
 
04:04:04.870 --> 04:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
counsel in cases before the court
 
04:04:06.870 --> 04:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
unrepresented parties are not familiar
 
04:04:10.630 --> 04:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
with the court rules or procedures
 
04:04:13.269 --> 04:04:13.279 align:start position:0%
unrepresented parties are often anxious
 
04:04:16.710 --> 04:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
or intimidated by appearing in court
 
04:04:18.550 --> 04:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
unrepresented parties often make
 
04:04:21.269 --> 04:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
unnecessary concessions in order to
 
04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
avoid the court proceedings
 
04:04:26.710 --> 04:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately unrepresented parties
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
do not understand the law
 
04:04:33.030 --> 04:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:35.990 --> 04:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
the financial cost of representation is
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
often a bar for litigants to receive
 
04:04:41.349 --> 04:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
proper representation
 
04:04:44.309 --> 04:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
the hourly cost in and of itself may be
 
04:04:44.319 --> 04:04:46.469 align:start position:0%
the hourly cost in and of itself may be
prohibited

04:04:46.469 --> 04:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
04:04:48.790 --> 04:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
but in particularly in family court
 
04:04:48.800 --> 04:04:50.070 align:start position:0%
but in particularly in family court
matters

04:04:50.070 --> 04:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
matters
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's common practice to obtain a
 
04:04:54.389 --> 04:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
retainer before an attorney will take on
 
04:04:55.990 --> 04:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
a case
 
04:04:57.990 --> 04:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
that cost of that retainer is generally
 
04:05:00.630 --> 04:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
three thousand or four thousand and or
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
five thousand or maybe more
 
04:05:07.269 --> 04:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:09.670 --> 04:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
even people with moderate incomes may
 
04:05:11.510 --> 04:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
find it difficult to raise the upfront
 
04:05:16.630 --> 04:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:18.070 --> 04:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
in addition to that we're currently
 
04:05:20.070 --> 04:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
obtaining we currently have a crisis
 
04:05:21.990 --> 04:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
with regard to evictions in this state
 
04:05:22.000 --> 04:05:22.710 align:start position:0%
with regard to evictions in this state
and

04:05:22.710 --> 04:05:22.720 align:start position:0%

04:05:22.720 --> 04:05:24.070 align:start position:0%
and
nationally

nationally
 
04:05:26.070 --> 04:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
and few people can be afforded to be
 
04:05:27.750 --> 04:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
represented generally these are people
 
04:05:28.950 --> 04:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
in crisis
 
04:05:28.960 --> 04:05:30.469 align:start position:0%

their rental property they are renters
 
04:05:35.269 --> 04:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
to begin with and few of them have the
 
04:05:38.550 --> 04:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
resources in order to obtain an attorney
 
04:05:41.349 --> 04:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
house bill 1343 would allow for
 
04:05:43.750 --> 04:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
non-attorneys in certain circumstances
 
04:05:47.030 --> 04:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
to provide representation to tenants in
 
04:05:51.670 --> 04:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:56.229 --> 04:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
i'd note that what this bill does
 
04:05:56.239 --> 04:05:57.110 align:start position:0%
i'd note that what this bill does
is

04:05:57.110 --> 04:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:06:00.150 --> 04:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
it provides for paralegals who are
 
04:06:03.510 --> 04:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
qualified either having a
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
four-year college degree or
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
a paraprofessional degree a two-year
 
04:06:07.920 --> 04:06:08.710 align:start position:0%

who is insured
 
04:06:21.750 --> 04:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
and who would be subject to the rules of
 
04:06:26.870 --> 04:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:29.830 --> 04:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
this is means tested
 
04:06:29.840 --> 04:06:30.950 align:start position:0%
this is means tested
so

04:06:30.950 --> 04:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:06:33.030 --> 04:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
it isn't going to be available for
 
04:06:35.349 --> 04:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
people who can in fact afford those high
 
04:06:38.150 --> 04:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
retainers or for those hourly fees it's
 
04:06:40.389 --> 04:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
mean tested to 300 percent of the
 
04:06:42.870 --> 04:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
poverty rate
 
04:06:44.790 --> 04:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
so it would be limited to people who
 
04:06:44.800 --> 04:06:45.670 align:start position:0%
so it would be limited to people who
have

04:06:45.670 --> 04:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:06:46.870 --> 04:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
the greatest
 
04:06:46.880 --> 04:06:49.110 align:start position:0%
the greatest
need

04:06:49.110 --> 04:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
need
 
04:06:52.309 --> 04:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
in addition if a non-attorney were to
 
04:06:54.550 --> 04:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
assist in representing they would have
 
04:06:56.150 --> 04:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
to provide notice they would have to
 
04:06:58.309 --> 04:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
provide notice to the client that they
 
04:07:00.070 --> 04:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
are a non-attorney
 
04:07:02.070 --> 04:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
and they would have to provide notice to
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
the court if they're filing pleadings or
 
04:07:05.590 --> 04:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
appearing in court that they are a
 
04:07:05.600 --> 04:07:11.510 align:start position:0%

non-attorney

04:07:11.510 --> 04:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:13.269 --> 04:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
having non-attorneys appear in court is
 
04:07:16.309 --> 04:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:18.630 --> 04:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
and i might add that the bill only
 
04:07:21.510 --> 04:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
provides for a pilot program
 
04:07:23.990 --> 04:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
just to see if in fact this program will
 
04:07:26.469 --> 04:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
have value to the state
 
04:07:29.269 --> 04:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
it would take place in two courts
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
it would take place in the court in
 
04:07:34.870 --> 04:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
manchester and the court in berlin both
 
04:07:37.349 --> 04:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
of these courts have high volumes of
 
04:07:37.359 --> 04:07:38.790 align:start position:0%
of these courts have high volumes of
unrepresented

04:07:38.790 --> 04:07:38.800 align:start position:0%

people
 
04:07:42.149 --> 04:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
it would be one urban court and one more

rural court
 
04:07:46.149 --> 04:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
and it would be limited to two types of

matters landlord-tenant matters
 
04:07:52.070 --> 04:07:52.080 align:start position:0%

04:08:28.950 --> 04:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
appear
 
04:08:30.630 --> 04:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
generally i think that the standard is
 
04:08:33.910 --> 04:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
no more than three times in a year
 
04:08:35.750 --> 04:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
and they have to be a good character so
 
04:08:37.910 --> 04:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
the court has set rules and that's
 
04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
another thing that this bill would do
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
would be allow the court to set rules
 
04:08:44.710 --> 04:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to the
 
04:08:47.110 --> 04:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh the qualifications of people to
 
04:08:47.120 --> 04:08:49.590 align:start position:0%
uh the qualifications of people to
appear

04:08:49.590 --> 04:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:52.630 --> 04:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
currently we allow police officers
 
04:08:52.640 --> 04:08:54.070 align:start position:0%
currently we allow police officers
to

04:08:54.070 --> 04:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:08:56.550 --> 04:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
participate in our courts
 
04:09:00.389 --> 04:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
they prosecute cases just like attorneys
 
04:09:01.670 --> 04:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
and they're not required to have one
 
04:09:07.990 --> 04:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:09.750 --> 04:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
we allow domestic violence advocates
 
04:09:11.429 --> 04:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony here on earlier
 
04:09:13.110 --> 04:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
bills with regard to domestic violence
 
04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
advocates they're not allowed to speak
 
04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
in the court
 
04:09:19.590 --> 04:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
but they assist people in providing
 
04:09:23.269 --> 04:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
legal legal advice to to their
 
04:09:27.110 --> 04:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:27.120 --> 04:09:28.550 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:09:30.950 --> 04:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
guardian adele items appear regularly in
 
04:09:33.510 --> 04:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
our court and we rely on them
 
04:09:35.830 --> 04:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
non-attorney when and we specifically
 
04:09:37.510 --> 04:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
when we created the guardian at light on
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
board this when the legislature created
 
04:09:42.309 --> 04:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
the guardian lighting board
 
04:09:44.229 --> 04:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
made it so you don't have to be an
 
04:09:45.750 --> 04:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
attorney to be a guardian enlightenment
 
04:09:47.990 --> 04:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
in this state because we know that you
 
04:09:49.429 --> 04:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have to have the
 
04:09:50.870 --> 04:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
skills of an attorney to be a good
 
04:09:54.830 --> 04:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:57.030 --> 04:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
non-attorneys uh
 
04:09:57.040 --> 04:09:58.309 align:start position:0%
non-attorneys uh
uh

04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:10:00.389 --> 04:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
we you're going to be hearing as well
 
04:10:00.399 --> 04:10:01.910 align:start position:0%
we you're going to be hearing as well
from

04:10:01.910 --> 04:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:10:04.309 --> 04:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
from uh new hampshire legal assistance
 
04:10:05.910 --> 04:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
here today
 
04:10:08.710 --> 04:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
but they're already using uh their
 
04:10:11.590 --> 04:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
paralegals to do or to represent clients
 
04:10:13.110 --> 04:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
and other types of hearings hearings
 
04:10:14.710 --> 04:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
before the health and human services
 
04:10:16.710 --> 04:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
administrative hearings
 
04:10:19.030 --> 04:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
and very successfully
 
04:10:23.189 --> 04:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:25.670 --> 04:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
then that's exactly who you know beca
 
04:10:25.680 --> 04:10:26.469 align:start position:0%
then that's exactly who you know beca
and

04:10:26.469 --> 04:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:10:28.229 --> 04:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
one of the things about the program is
 
04:10:30.309 --> 04:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
it would be have a limited window
 
04:10:32.550 --> 04:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
so it's a two-year pilot program
 
04:10:32.560 --> 04:10:34.710 align:start position:0%
so it's a two-year pilot program
sunsetted

04:10:34.710 --> 04:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
sunsetted
 
04:10:36.550 --> 04:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
so in two years it would give us an
 
04:10:41.110 --> 04:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:43.110 --> 04:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't work we can do away with
 
04:10:43.120 --> 04:10:45.670 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't work we can do away with
it

04:10:45.670 --> 04:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:45.680 --> 04:10:47.510 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:10:47.510 --> 04:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:10:49.750 --> 04:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
it was interesting to hear the comments
 
04:10:52.149 --> 04:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
from the representative from the human
 
04:10:53.429 --> 04:10:53.439 align:start position:0%
rights commission
 
04:10:55.030 --> 04:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
when she was given a legal question
 
04:10:57.269 --> 04:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
today who she said she have to consult
 
04:10:59.910 --> 04:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
with before she gave the answer
 
04:11:04.469 --> 04:11:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:06.870 --> 04:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
there are many capable paralegals out
 
04:11:08.309 --> 04:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
there and
 
04:11:10.790 --> 04:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
frankly i don't see this as a situation
 
04:11:10.800 --> 04:11:11.990 align:start position:0%
frankly i don't see this as a situation
where

04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:11:12.000 --> 04:11:12.790 align:start position:0%
where
uh

04:11:12.790 --> 04:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:11:14.630 --> 04:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
you're just going to have people who are
 
04:11:16.469 --> 04:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
now non-attorneys out representing
 
04:11:16.479 --> 04:11:17.750 align:start position:0%
now non-attorneys out representing
clients

04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
clients
 
04:11:19.349 --> 04:11:19.359 align:start position:0%
it's going to be the under the auspices
 
04:11:21.429 --> 04:11:21.439 align:start position:0%
of an attorney and i the way i certainly
 
04:11:23.110 --> 04:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
envision this working is you probably
 
04:11:25.030 --> 04:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
consult with an attorney
 
04:11:27.030 --> 04:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
and then you work with the paralegal and
 
04:11:29.110 --> 04:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
the attorney sends the paralegal to
 
04:11:29.120 --> 04:11:30.229 align:start position:0%
the attorney sends the paralegal to
court

04:11:30.229 --> 04:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
court
 
04:11:32.630 --> 04:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
to act on behalf of the client
 
04:11:34.870 --> 04:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
and that would seem to work out
 
04:11:36.710 --> 04:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
particularly well
 
04:11:39.030 --> 04:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
frankly the paralegals when i was doing
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
this type of practice the paralegals
 
04:11:43.510 --> 04:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
prepared the pleadings for me
 
04:11:46.469 --> 04:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
they did everything frankly except go to
 
04:11:46.479 --> 04:11:47.590 align:start position:0%
they did everything frankly except go to
court

04:11:47.590 --> 04:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
court
 
04:11:51.670 --> 04:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:53.269 --> 04:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
i'm you know i'm well aware that many of
 
04:11:55.269 --> 04:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
my colleagues who are members of the bar
 
04:11:56.790 --> 04:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
may object to the bill
 
04:11:58.870 --> 04:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
and may have concerns that the public
 
04:12:00.630 --> 04:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
will not be well served
 
04:12:04.469 --> 04:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
by people who are not formally trained
 
04:12:06.070 --> 04:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
but one thing i would say is the buyers
 
04:12:12.070 --> 04:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:14.149 --> 04:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
and i'd ask what remedy have they
 
04:12:14.159 --> 04:12:16.710 align:start position:0%
and i'd ask what remedy have they
provided

04:12:16.710 --> 04:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
provided
 
04:12:19.189 --> 04:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
i also would say this is not a panacea i
 
04:12:20.550 --> 04:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
04:12:21.990 --> 04:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden we're going to do away
 
04:12:24.630 --> 04:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
by adopting this program or a program of
 
04:12:27.189 --> 04:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
this type that we're going to do away
 
04:12:27.199 --> 04:12:28.229 align:start position:0%
this type that we're going to do away
with

04:12:28.229 --> 04:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:12:30.229 --> 04:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
with unrepresented clients it just isn't
 
04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
04:12:31.680 --> 04:12:33.110 align:start position:0%
going to happen
but

04:12:33.110 --> 04:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:12:35.110 --> 04:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
it could make a dent in it it could help
 
04:12:37.189 --> 04:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
it could assist and more people
 
04:12:38.710 --> 04:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
people that we're supposed to be serving
 
04:12:47.189 --> 04:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:49.349 --> 04:12:49.359 align:start position:0%
this is i might add it's a trend across
 
04:12:51.670 --> 04:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
the country this isn't something that is
 
04:12:54.149 --> 04:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
unique to new hampshire there are other
 
04:12:55.750 --> 04:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
states i
 
04:12:58.389 --> 04:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
have and may have sent out already to
 
04:13:00.389 --> 04:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
you a
 
04:13:00.399 --> 04:13:01.590 align:start position:0%
you a
article

04:13:01.590 --> 04:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
article
 
04:13:01.600 --> 04:13:02.630 align:start position:0%
article
about

04:13:02.630 --> 04:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
oregon adopting a very similar type
 
04:13:05.040 --> 04:13:06.229 align:start position:0%
oregon adopting a very similar type
program

04:13:06.229 --> 04:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:13:09.110 --> 04:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
one of the advantages of this program
 
04:13:09.120 --> 04:13:10.309 align:start position:0%
one of the advantages of this program
there

04:13:10.309 --> 04:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:13:12.469 --> 04:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
they have allowed paralegals in other
 
04:13:13.990 --> 04:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
states i think the state of washington
 
04:13:15.510 --> 04:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
had a program
 
04:13:15.520 --> 04:13:16.630 align:start position:0%
had a program
where

04:13:16.630 --> 04:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:13:19.189 --> 04:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
they would allow paralegals to represent
 
04:13:22.630 --> 04:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
clients in certain matters
 
04:13:26.870 --> 04:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
but they had a licensing program
 
04:13:29.349 --> 04:13:29.359 align:start position:0%
and high requirements for the persons to
 
04:13:30.790 --> 04:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:13:33.110 --> 04:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
and it was so complicated and so
 
04:13:33.120 --> 04:13:34.389 align:start position:0%
and it was so complicated and so
difficult

04:13:34.389 --> 04:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
04:13:37.030 --> 04:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
that it was it formed a barrier and
 
04:13:39.750 --> 04:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
frankly the program wasn't a success
 
04:13:42.550 --> 04:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
i think the way we've designed it here
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
would be efficient
 
04:13:44.399 --> 04:13:45.670 align:start position:0%
would be efficient
practical

04:13:45.670 --> 04:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
practical
 
04:13:47.910 --> 04:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
and will not create a barrier for people
 
04:13:49.349 --> 04:13:49.359 align:start position:0%
who want to provide these types of
 
04:13:49.359 --> 04:13:51.670 align:start position:0%
who want to provide these types of
services

04:13:51.670 --> 04:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:13:53.670 --> 04:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
the other thing i'd say is that this is
 
04:13:55.269 --> 04:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
analogous to what's happened in the
 
04:13:59.110 --> 04:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:00.229 --> 04:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
we've seen in recent years the
 
04:14:02.630 --> 04:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
development of nurse practitioners
 
04:14:05.510 --> 04:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
and physicians assistants
 
04:14:07.269 --> 04:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
and i believe that this could work in
 
04:14:09.510 --> 04:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and that we should make an
 
04:14:09.520 --> 04:14:11.910 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and that we should make an
effort

04:14:11.910 --> 04:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
effort
 
04:14:16.870 --> 04:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:18.630 --> 04:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's interesting
 
04:14:20.389 --> 04:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
because i was in the legislature a long
 
04:14:22.630 --> 04:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
time ago and this was at a time when
 
04:14:24.149 --> 04:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
they were talking about having nurse
 
04:14:27.189 --> 04:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
practitioners and what and having them
 
04:14:29.590 --> 04:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
just practice to start out just practice
 
04:14:31.110 --> 04:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
under the auspices of an attorney
 
04:14:31.120 --> 04:14:32.870 align:start position:0%
under the auspices of an attorney
whatever

04:14:32.870 --> 04:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:14:35.269 --> 04:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
which is evolved from that but the big
 
04:14:37.670 --> 04:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
issue at that time
 
04:14:37.680 --> 04:14:38.550 align:start position:0%
issue at that time
was

04:14:38.550 --> 04:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:14:41.110 --> 04:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
prescribing medications
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
because that was the one that was the
 
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
one thing that physicians felt made them
 
04:14:49.990 --> 04:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
that they could hold on that that
 
04:14:52.870 --> 04:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
protected their practice frankly
 
04:14:52.880 --> 04:14:54.309 align:start position:0%
protected their practice frankly
and

04:14:54.309 --> 04:14:54.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:54.319 --> 04:14:55.429 align:start position:0%
and
and

04:14:55.429 --> 04:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:57.590 --> 04:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
as time has evolved now nurse
 
04:15:00.149 --> 04:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
practitioners can prescribe medications
 
04:15:02.149 --> 04:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
and it's gone down through the line and
 
04:15:04.149 --> 04:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
i don't think the doctors have suffered
 
04:15:07.830 --> 04:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
i think the doctors have done just fine
 
04:15:09.590 --> 04:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
i think the same thing is true because
 
04:15:13.269 --> 04:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
the one last barrier in the law
 
04:15:15.990 --> 04:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
is the ability to appear in court
 
04:15:18.469 --> 04:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
that's the one last barrier
 
04:15:21.030 --> 04:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
and this would determine whether or not
 
04:15:23.429 --> 04:15:23.439 align:start position:0%
you can
 
04:15:25.349 --> 04:15:25.359 align:start position:0%
affect that barrier
 
04:15:27.030 --> 04:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
and whether it will do any harm to do
 
04:15:32.469 --> 04:15:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:34.550 --> 04:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
i gotta i gotta say that if you had
 
04:15:35.910 --> 04:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
asked me
 
04:15:38.149 --> 04:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh 20 years ago whether
 
04:15:39.830 --> 04:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
i thought this was a good idea or not
 
04:15:42.790 --> 04:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
you know to to be fair to my uh
 
04:15:45.030 --> 04:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the bar if you asked me 20
 
04:15:46.229 --> 04:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
years ago whether i thought this was a
 
04:15:48.070 --> 04:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
good idea i'd say no
 
04:15:50.309 --> 04:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
i'd be totally against it because i'd
 
04:15:50.319 --> 04:15:51.189 align:start position:0%
i'd be totally against it because i'd
say

04:15:51.189 --> 04:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:15:52.630 --> 04:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
i went to college and then i went to
 
04:15:58.389 --> 04:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
three years of law school hard work
 
04:16:00.630 --> 04:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
i spent a ton of money
 
04:16:02.389 --> 04:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
i didn't happen to but a lot of my
 
04:16:04.309 --> 04:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
colleagues went into a lot of debt to
 
04:16:06.389 --> 04:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
become lawyers
 
04:16:06.399 --> 04:16:08.229 align:start position:0%
become lawyers
and

04:16:08.229 --> 04:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:16:12.309 --> 04:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:14.229 --> 04:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
and pass that bar exam to become a
 
04:16:14.239 --> 04:16:15.269 align:start position:0%
and pass that bar exam to become a
lawyer

04:16:15.269 --> 04:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
04:16:17.590 --> 04:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
and i just don't want somebody else just
 
04:16:19.750 --> 04:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
to take over and start doing that job
 
04:16:22.229 --> 04:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
and i think that's probably the way i
 
04:16:23.910 --> 04:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
felt about it
 
04:16:25.910 --> 04:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the other
 
04:16:27.429 --> 04:16:27.439 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:16:28.790 --> 04:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
and i
 
04:16:31.750 --> 04:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't blame anybody for feeling that way
 
04:16:34.070 --> 04:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh and i think the other argument they'd
 
04:16:36.870 --> 04:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
make is you know the issue of uh public
 
04:16:40.070 --> 04:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
safety uh and you know geez you know i
 
04:16:43.750 --> 04:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
received training in the law and
 
04:16:44.950 --> 04:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
i expect
 
04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
in order to protect
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
the interests of the public
 
04:16:50.309 --> 04:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
they should be represented by people who
 
04:16:52.790 --> 04:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
have had adequate training
 
04:16:55.030 --> 04:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
i can tell you in law school
 
04:16:57.030 --> 04:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
i certainly came out of law school i did
 
04:16:58.550 --> 04:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
divorces and
 
04:17:00.550 --> 04:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
custody matters
 
04:17:02.950 --> 04:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
before i became a judge
 
04:17:04.630 --> 04:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
i never learned a damn thing about him
 
04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
in law school so
 
04:17:09.269 --> 04:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
because they don't really teach
 
04:17:10.630 --> 04:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
what it's like to practice they teach
 
04:17:12.469 --> 04:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
you good things they teach you how to be
 
04:17:12.479 --> 04:17:13.990 align:start position:0%
you good things they teach you how to be
logical

04:17:13.990 --> 04:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
logical
 
04:17:15.910 --> 04:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
they teach you how to speak they teach
 
04:17:17.830 --> 04:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
you how to appear in court but when it
 
04:17:19.269 --> 04:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
comes down to those types of really
 
04:17:20.790 --> 04:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
tough issues that you have to deal with
 
04:17:22.710 --> 04:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
in the family court you don't really get
 
04:17:26.229 --> 04:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
that in law school i don't believe
 
04:17:28.229 --> 04:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
anyway uh the
 
04:17:29.750 --> 04:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
long and the short
 
04:17:32.469 --> 04:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
is i think
 
04:17:34.790 --> 04:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
but my view has changed and my view has
 
04:17:37.110 --> 04:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
changed over time over those 20 years
 
04:17:39.110 --> 04:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
and part of the view is being a part of
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
04:17:44.149 --> 04:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
and and that is that i know ultimately
 
04:17:47.750 --> 04:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
our purpose here is to serve the public
 
04:17:47.760 --> 04:17:48.950 align:start position:0%
our purpose here is to serve the public
and

04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:52.870 --> 04:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
i think the public will be better served
 
04:17:54.790 --> 04:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
if in fact
 
04:17:57.030 --> 04:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
we allow more people to be represented
 
04:17:58.229 --> 04:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
in our courts
 
04:18:00.389 --> 04:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
i think this is a way to go about to see
 
04:18:02.870 --> 04:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
whether we can do that and i would
 
04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
encourage you to support the bill
 
04:18:08.070 --> 04:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:18:10.309 --> 04:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you if we have any questions right
 
04:18:14.309 --> 04:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
over here representative chase
 
04:18:16.389 --> 04:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and
 
04:18:18.229 --> 04:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gordon for
 
04:18:19.670 --> 04:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:18:23.110 --> 04:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
i know this is a pilot program i
 
04:18:23.120 --> 04:18:24.309 align:start position:0%
i know this is a pilot program i
see

04:18:24.309 --> 04:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:18:27.269 --> 04:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
the good of it what i want to know is
 
04:18:29.030 --> 04:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
how would that work where we're talking
 
04:18:31.830 --> 04:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
about saying to retain a lawyer could be
 
04:18:34.309 --> 04:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
up to three thousand dollars are these
 
04:18:36.149 --> 04:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
paralegals going to be sitting in the
 
04:18:37.990 --> 04:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
courtroom and then they're just going to
 
04:18:40.550 --> 04:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
say hey i can help you will the public
 
04:18:43.910 --> 04:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
know about it to be able to
 
04:18:46.950 --> 04:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
have the services provided with them
 
04:18:49.269 --> 04:18:49.279 align:start position:0%
um do you understand what i'm trying to
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
say yeah i do okay thank you
 
04:18:54.070 --> 04:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
um first of all it's a pilot
 
04:18:56.149 --> 04:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
it's a pilot program
 
04:18:58.710 --> 04:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
and it's sunsetted so
 
04:19:02.070 --> 04:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
do i think a lot of private law firms
 
04:19:04.070 --> 04:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
are going to invest in this program to
 
04:19:05.269 --> 04:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
04:19:06.950 --> 04:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
probably not
 
04:19:08.469 --> 04:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
because they're not going to make a big
 
04:19:10.790 --> 04:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
investment knowing that it might not end
 
04:19:12.790 --> 04:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
up forever
 
04:19:15.269 --> 04:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
i think that there are plenty of law
 
04:19:17.670 --> 04:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
firms today that have qualified
 
04:19:17.680 --> 04:19:20.710 align:start position:0%
firms today that have qualified
paralegals

04:19:20.710 --> 04:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
we did a study committee
 
04:19:25.910 --> 04:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
some members that are sitting here were
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
on that study committee
 
04:19:30.550 --> 04:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
two years ago and we had lawyers who
 
04:19:32.389 --> 04:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
came in and said yeah my paralegal could
 
04:19:34.870 --> 04:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
go to court tomorrow so there are some
 
04:19:36.389 --> 04:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
people who could
 
04:19:39.429 --> 04:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
uh work this to have their paralegals go
 
04:19:41.349 --> 04:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
to court i believe today but i'm not
 
04:19:43.269 --> 04:19:43.279 align:start position:0%
sure anybody invested what really i
 
04:19:44.870 --> 04:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
think where you may see the benefit and
 
04:19:46.229 --> 04:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear from new hampshire
 
04:19:48.149 --> 04:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
legal assistance
 
04:19:50.070 --> 04:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
is they have paralegals right now who
 
04:19:52.149 --> 04:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
could do this tomorrow
 
04:19:54.950 --> 04:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
and i think that you're going to see
 
04:19:56.790 --> 04:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
that they're the ones that probably are
 
04:19:59.269 --> 04:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
going to the non-profit agencies
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
603 legal aid
 
04:20:04.389 --> 04:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
may very well use this program
 
04:20:06.389 --> 04:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire legal assistance
 
04:20:08.070 --> 04:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
i was talking about the disability
 
04:20:09.750 --> 04:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
rights center they don't do much court
 
04:20:11.910 --> 04:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
work right now but i could see this as a
 
04:20:14.710 --> 04:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
potential for them as well working with
 
04:20:16.710 --> 04:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
disabilities people with disabilities
 
04:20:19.269 --> 04:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
and having them represented in court
 
04:20:19.279 --> 04:20:20.550 align:start position:0%
and having them represented in court
so

04:20:20.550 --> 04:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh that's where
 
04:20:24.309 --> 04:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
that's where i i think it's going to
 
04:20:24.319 --> 04:20:27.830 align:start position:0%
that's where i i think it's going to
happen

04:20:27.830 --> 04:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:30.870 --> 04:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:33.750 --> 04:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative langley
 
04:20:35.429 --> 04:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:20:37.110 --> 04:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative gordon for taking my
 
04:20:37.120 --> 04:20:38.229 align:start position:0%
representative gordon for taking my
question

04:20:38.229 --> 04:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:20:41.030 --> 04:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
on line seven you talk about supervision
 
04:20:43.030 --> 04:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
that would be provided to these
 
04:20:45.750 --> 04:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
paralegals do you have any sense of what
 
04:20:48.309 --> 04:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
that supervision would include and the
 
04:20:50.710 --> 04:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
frequency of it and the amount of time
 
04:20:50.720 --> 04:20:52.950 align:start position:0%
frequency of it and the amount of time
or

04:20:52.950 --> 04:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:54.630 --> 04:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
04:20:54.640 --> 04:20:55.750 align:start position:0%
well uh
currently

04:20:55.750 --> 04:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:20:57.429 --> 04:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
whenever you have a paraprofessional
 
04:20:59.670 --> 04:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
working for a lawyer the lawyer has
 
04:21:02.149 --> 04:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh that duty of care and has the
 
04:21:05.030 --> 04:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility to provide supervision
 
04:21:07.030 --> 04:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
that exists today really
 
04:21:10.070 --> 04:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
and so they the supervision does not
 
04:21:11.670 --> 04:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that they have to
 
04:21:13.990 --> 04:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
accompany them to court
 
04:21:16.389 --> 04:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
but they would have to take they in
 
04:21:18.630 --> 04:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
essence are taking responsibility for
 
04:21:22.790 --> 04:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
their conduct in court okay thank you
 
04:21:24.950 --> 04:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
they know that they potentially hold the
 
04:21:27.990 --> 04:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
liability if that paralegal
 
04:21:29.830 --> 04:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
does not
 
04:21:29.840 --> 04:21:31.750 align:start position:0%
does not
misperforms

04:21:31.750 --> 04:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
misperforms
 
04:21:33.990 --> 04:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:21:36.630 --> 04:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
question from representative dilorenzo
 
04:21:38.229 --> 04:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr clear and thank you for
 
04:21:40.389 --> 04:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
04:21:42.469 --> 04:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
so would this
 
04:21:43.850 --> 04:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
program be um
 
04:21:43.860 --> 04:21:45.910 align:start position:0%
program be um
[Music]

04:21:45.910 --> 04:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:21:47.750 --> 04:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
would this program be appropriate for a
 
04:21:51.910 --> 04:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
law student to take part in
 
04:21:54.630 --> 04:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
we already have a program for law
 
04:21:57.429 --> 04:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
students called rule 36
 
04:21:59.189 --> 04:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
and which
 
04:22:03.349 --> 04:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:05.189 --> 04:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
that's interesting because
 
04:22:07.030 --> 04:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
under rule 36 there are certain
 
04:22:07.040 --> 04:22:08.630 align:start position:0%
under rule 36 there are certain
requirements

04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:22:10.950 --> 04:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
and this might be able to expand the
 
04:22:13.189 --> 04:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
role of students in certain
 
04:22:13.199 --> 04:22:18.550 align:start position:0%
role of students in certain
circumstances

04:22:18.550 --> 04:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:22.469 --> 04:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
anybody else yes representative
 
04:22:24.469 --> 04:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for
 
04:22:26.229 --> 04:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
allowing me the question and thank you
 
04:22:29.269 --> 04:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um i'm sorry if i
 
04:22:32.149 --> 04:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
missed this but uh what was the intent
 
04:22:33.750 --> 04:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:22:38.389 --> 04:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:41.110 --> 04:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
federal poverty guideline yep what was
 
04:22:44.550 --> 04:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
the intent yes well
 
04:22:47.910 --> 04:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
it sort of was anticipating an objection
 
04:22:50.630 --> 04:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh from the bar association
 
04:22:52.870 --> 04:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
that now people
 
04:22:55.269 --> 04:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
who could afford an attorney would now
 
04:22:55.279 --> 04:22:56.550 align:start position:0%
who could afford an attorney would now
be

04:22:56.550 --> 04:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:22:56.560 --> 04:22:57.830 align:start position:0%
be
hiring

04:22:57.830 --> 04:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
04:22:57.840 --> 04:22:59.830 align:start position:0%
hiring
someone

04:22:59.830 --> 04:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
someone
 
04:23:01.590 --> 04:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
to get a
 
04:23:03.030 --> 04:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
basically just for the purpose of
 
04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
getting a better rate
 
04:23:07.030 --> 04:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:23:07.040 --> 04:23:07.750 align:start position:0%
and so
i

04:23:07.750 --> 04:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:23:10.389 --> 04:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
to avoid them having being threatened i
 
04:23:12.469 --> 04:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
think that's probably why that was
 
04:23:12.479 --> 04:23:13.510 align:start position:0%
think that's probably why that was
included

04:23:13.510 --> 04:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
included
 
04:23:16.389 --> 04:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
thank you if that makes sense
 
04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:23.110 --> 04:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
cnn thank you for your testimony
 
04:23:25.429 --> 04:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:23:30.149 --> 04:23:30.159 align:start position:0%

great okay good afternoon mr chair
 
04:24:05.510 --> 04:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
04:24:07.830 --> 04:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
sarah matson dustin i am an attorney and
 
04:24:09.670 --> 04:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
the executive director at new hampshire
 
04:24:11.269 --> 04:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
legal assistance
 
04:24:13.110 --> 04:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
for those who aren't familiar with nhla
 
04:24:15.429 --> 04:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
we have been around for about 50 years
 
04:24:17.030 --> 04:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
and we're a non-profit legal aid
 
04:24:19.349 --> 04:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
provider which means that we help people
 
04:24:21.910 --> 04:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
with low income in cases that impact
 
04:24:23.990 --> 04:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
their basic human needs and i'm very
 
04:24:25.670 --> 04:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
happy to be here today to speak in
 
04:24:29.510 --> 04:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
support of house bill 1343.
 
04:24:32.070 --> 04:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
there is no right to an attorney in most
 
04:24:33.429 --> 04:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
civil cases
 
04:24:35.269 --> 04:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
so people facing eviction don't have a
 
04:24:36.950 --> 04:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
right to an attorney folks who are
 
04:24:38.389 --> 04:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
litigating a divorce
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
or their parenting rights to their minor
 
04:24:41.269 --> 04:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
children don't have a right to an
 
04:24:41.279 --> 04:24:42.309 align:start position:0%
children don't have a right to an
attorney

04:24:42.309 --> 04:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
04:24:43.830 --> 04:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
and as representative gordon said that
 
04:24:45.670 --> 04:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
means that the majority of litigants who
 
04:24:47.830 --> 04:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
are appearing in the circuit court
 
04:24:49.349 --> 04:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
are doing so while representing
 
04:24:51.750 --> 04:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
themselves upwards of 90 percent of
 
04:24:51.760 --> 04:24:52.790 align:start position:0%
themselves upwards of 90 percent of
tenants

04:24:52.790 --> 04:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
tenants
 
04:24:55.030 --> 04:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
who are facing eviction are going it
 
04:24:55.040 --> 04:24:56.229 align:start position:0%
who are facing eviction are going it
alone

04:24:56.229 --> 04:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
alone
 
04:24:58.870 --> 04:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
in the majority of family law cases so
 
04:25:00.710 --> 04:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
divorce and custody in the majority of
 
04:25:02.229 --> 04:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
those both parties are representing
 
04:25:02.239 --> 04:25:03.510 align:start position:0%
those both parties are representing
themselves

04:25:03.510 --> 04:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
and some some self-represented litigants
 
04:25:07.269 --> 04:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
are able to protect their interests
 
04:25:07.279 --> 04:25:08.630 align:start position:0%
are able to protect their interests
effectively

04:25:08.630 --> 04:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
04:25:11.030 --> 04:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
but others who don't understand the
 
04:25:13.269 --> 04:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
subject matter or don't understand the
 
04:25:15.750 --> 04:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
court's complex procedural roles
 
04:25:18.070 --> 04:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
and are having to do so at a difficult
 
04:25:19.590 --> 04:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
time in their lives
 
04:25:21.349 --> 04:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
can struggle to protect their own
 
04:25:21.359 --> 04:25:23.269 align:start position:0%
can struggle to protect their own
interests

04:25:23.269 --> 04:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
interests
 
04:25:25.189 --> 04:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
we're enthusiastic
 
04:25:27.110 --> 04:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
about this bill because we see it as an
 
04:25:29.269 --> 04:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
access to justice measure a way to get
 
04:25:32.710 --> 04:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
more legal help to people who need it
 
04:25:34.149 --> 04:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
i think it's really important to
 
04:25:36.630 --> 04:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
distinguish this pilot project from what
 
04:25:39.910 --> 04:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
a few other states have done so in utah
 
04:25:44.229 --> 04:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
washington and arizona there have been
 
04:25:45.910 --> 04:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
efforts that have resulted in
 
04:25:48.469 --> 04:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
independent paralegal licensure so
 
04:25:51.189 --> 04:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
allowing paralegals to practice on their
 
04:25:51.199 --> 04:25:52.469 align:start position:0%
allowing paralegals to practice on their
own

04:25:52.469 --> 04:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
own
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's still going in utah and in
 
04:25:57.189 --> 04:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
arizona washington state sunsetted their
 
04:25:59.030 --> 04:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
program and this is categorically
 
04:25:59.040 --> 04:25:59.990 align:start position:0%
program and this is categorically
different

04:25:59.990 --> 04:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:26:03.030 --> 04:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would require paralegals to be
 
04:26:06.309 --> 04:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
both employed by and supervised by a
 
04:26:08.389 --> 04:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
licensed attorney has educational
 
04:26:10.229 --> 04:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
requirements including
 
04:26:12.070 --> 04:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
both a bachelor's degree or an
 
04:26:13.670 --> 04:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
associate's degree in a law related
 
04:26:16.309 --> 04:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
field plus two years of work uh work
 
04:26:18.149 --> 04:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
experience in a law related setting with
 
04:26:20.469 --> 04:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
attorney supervision has a disclosure
 
04:26:22.550 --> 04:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
requirement so both the client and the
 
04:26:24.630 --> 04:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
court would need to be notified that the
 
04:26:26.389 --> 04:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
person is not an attorney and given the
 
04:26:28.790 --> 04:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
name of the supervising attorney
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
and the supervising attorney
 
04:26:33.590 --> 04:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
has the obligation to ensure that the
 
04:26:35.429 --> 04:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional is comporting with the
 
04:26:37.510 --> 04:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
rules of professional conduct and has to
 
04:26:41.750 --> 04:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:42.950 --> 04:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
at our firm
 
04:26:45.269 --> 04:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
we have paralegal advocates doing what
 
04:26:47.429 --> 04:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
we call administrative law so they may
 
04:26:49.670 --> 04:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
be helping someone who is appealing a
 
04:26:52.630 --> 04:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
social security disability decision
 
04:26:54.630 --> 04:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
or trying to get unemployment insurance
 
04:26:54.640 --> 04:26:55.750 align:start position:0%
or trying to get unemployment insurance
benefits

04:26:55.750 --> 04:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
04:26:57.910 --> 04:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
or even seeking immigration relief and
 
04:26:59.830 --> 04:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
these are all settings in which
 
04:27:02.870 --> 04:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
non-lawyers are explicitly authorized
 
04:27:05.269 --> 04:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
to be able to represent clients
 
04:27:07.110 --> 04:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
these are often highly technical
 
04:27:09.110 --> 04:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
proceedings where the paraprofessional
 
04:27:12.149 --> 04:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
has to understand the substantive law as
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
well as
 
04:27:15.670 --> 04:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
often highly complex administrative
 
04:27:17.429 --> 04:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
procedural rules
 
04:27:19.670 --> 04:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
and our paralegal advocates handle these
 
04:27:19.680 --> 04:27:20.950 align:start position:0%
and our paralegal advocates handle these
cases

04:27:20.950 --> 04:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
cases
 
04:27:22.710 --> 04:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
incredibly capably and with great
 
04:27:22.720 --> 04:27:24.389 align:start position:0%
incredibly capably and with great
success

04:27:24.389 --> 04:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
success
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
the other thing i want to note is that
 
04:27:28.870 --> 04:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
there are really very
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
very few bars to attorneys representing
 
04:27:34.550 --> 04:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
clients in court so the day that you are
 
04:27:34.560 --> 04:27:35.990 align:start position:0%
clients in court so the day that you are
licensed

04:27:35.990 --> 04:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
04:27:37.990 --> 04:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
you can lawfully
 
04:27:39.670 --> 04:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
represent someone
 
04:27:42.229 --> 04:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
who is charged with homicide you can
 
04:27:45.030 --> 04:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
lawfully represent someone in a million
 
04:27:48.630 --> 04:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
dollar personal injury lawsuit
 
04:27:50.790 --> 04:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
now virtually no attorneys would choose
 
04:27:52.229 --> 04:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
to do that because it would they would
 
04:27:55.670 --> 04:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
likely not be able to do so competently
 
04:27:57.990 --> 04:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
but the point that i'm trying to make
 
04:27:59.670 --> 04:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:28:02.309 --> 04:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
a trained paraprofessional with
 
04:28:05.110 --> 04:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
education experience and supervision can
 
04:28:07.269 --> 04:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely do this
 
04:28:09.349 --> 04:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
with no more risk
 
04:28:12.389 --> 04:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
to the public than simply simply already
 
04:28:12.399 --> 04:28:14.070 align:start position:0%
to the public than simply simply already
exists

04:28:14.070 --> 04:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
exists
 
04:28:16.149 --> 04:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
so we would love to
 
04:28:18.550 --> 04:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
tell you more about nhla and about what
 
04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
our paralegals do so i'll leave it at
 
04:28:22.710 --> 04:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
that and invite you to ask any questions
 
04:28:24.309 --> 04:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
that you have thanks for giving me the
 
04:28:26.389 --> 04:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak thank you do we
 
04:28:29.670 --> 04:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:32.229 --> 04:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
oh okay representative chase thank you
 
04:28:33.910 --> 04:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question i might
 
04:28:35.269 --> 04:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
have just
 
04:28:38.229 --> 04:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
skipped over this but so the paralegal
 
04:28:40.550 --> 04:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
helps and does all the work for the
 
04:28:40.560 --> 04:28:42.469 align:start position:0%
helps and does all the work for the
client

04:28:42.469 --> 04:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
client
 
04:28:45.030 --> 04:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
in this pilot program but then and they
 
04:28:47.510 --> 04:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
also are allowed then to appear in court
 
04:28:49.750 --> 04:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
as representation or does the lawyer
 
04:28:51.990 --> 04:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
then have to step in thanks for the
 
04:28:53.110 --> 04:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
question so
 
04:28:55.990 --> 04:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
um so what this pilot would authorize is
 
04:28:58.070 --> 04:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
for the paralegal actually to provide
 
04:29:00.389 --> 04:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
representation in the courtroom
 
04:29:01.990 --> 04:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
so essentially
 
04:29:03.269 --> 04:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:29:04.950 --> 04:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
the first scenario that you described is
 
04:29:07.269 --> 04:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
what is already permissible
 
04:29:07.279 --> 04:29:09.269 align:start position:0%
what is already permissible
so

04:29:09.269 --> 04:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:29:11.189 --> 04:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
if you look at the the bar news which is
 
04:29:13.030 --> 04:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
the the lawyers trade journal here in
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that the job postings at
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
the back
 
04:29:17.279 --> 04:29:18.389 align:start position:0%
the back
dozens

04:29:18.389 --> 04:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
dozens
 
04:29:20.870 --> 04:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
of opportunities for paralegals across
 
04:29:22.630 --> 04:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
all practice settings litigation
 
04:29:24.469 --> 04:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
corporate et cetera so
 
04:29:26.149 --> 04:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
if you've if you've paid for legal
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
services in the private market in new
 
04:29:29.030 --> 04:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire you have almost certainly
 
04:29:30.790 --> 04:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
gotten part of what you paid for through
 
04:29:32.550 --> 04:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
the services of a paralegal
 
04:29:34.149 --> 04:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
but right now there's just this
 
04:29:36.070 --> 04:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
invisible line around the courthouse
 
04:29:37.269 --> 04:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
that says
 
04:29:40.309 --> 04:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
through here you shall not pass
 
04:29:40.319 --> 04:29:41.189 align:start position:0%
through here you shall not pass
and

04:29:41.189 --> 04:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:29:42.469 --> 04:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
that's what we'd like to have the
 
04:29:44.229 --> 04:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to show that that
 
04:29:46.229 --> 04:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals in the family law
 
04:29:47.590 --> 04:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
setting in the landlord attendance
 
04:29:50.550 --> 04:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
setting um can
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
can could do a good job and it's really
 
04:29:53.040 --> 04:29:54.389 align:start position:0%
can could do a good job and it's really
not

04:29:54.389 --> 04:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:29:55.670 --> 04:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
it's not about whether someone's going
 
04:29:57.429 --> 04:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
to have a lawyer or a paralegal this
 
04:29:58.630 --> 04:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
bill is about whether someone's going to
 
04:29:59.910 --> 04:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
have a paralegal or they're going to
 
04:30:01.429 --> 04:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
have nothing
 
04:30:03.189 --> 04:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:30:03.199 --> 04:30:04.149 align:start position:0%
and so
it

04:30:04.149 --> 04:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:30:05.990 --> 04:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
it would get rid of that invisible line
 
04:30:07.590 --> 04:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
and give us a chance to show that this
 
04:30:09.990 --> 04:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
can be done in a way that will
 
04:30:13.189 --> 04:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
help some people and and maintain
 
04:30:17.110 --> 04:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:18.630 --> 04:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
and okay question over here
 
04:30:20.469 --> 04:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia thank you mr
 
04:30:21.990 --> 04:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
04:30:22.000 --> 04:30:23.030 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

04:30:23.030 --> 04:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:30:24.870 --> 04:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
regarding the attorneys that are
 
04:30:30.309 --> 04:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:33.590 --> 04:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really speak to exactly
 
04:30:36.070 --> 04:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
how closely they are
 
04:30:36.080 --> 04:30:38.149 align:start position:0%
how closely they are
supervising

04:30:38.149 --> 04:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
supervising
 
04:30:38.159 --> 04:30:40.790 align:start position:0%
supervising
what

04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:42.550 --> 04:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
what would
 
04:30:45.429 --> 04:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
be a reasonable assumption as far as the
 
04:30:47.110 --> 04:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
number of paraprofessionals that might
 
04:30:49.429 --> 04:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
be working under one attorney
 
04:30:50.790 --> 04:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:30:53.030 --> 04:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
generally the level of supervision that
 
04:30:53.040 --> 04:30:54.550 align:start position:0%
generally the level of supervision that
you

04:30:54.550 --> 04:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:30:54.560 --> 04:30:55.510 align:start position:0%
you
envision

04:30:55.510 --> 04:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
envision
 
04:30:56.870 --> 04:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
so that's an excellent question thanks
 
04:30:59.349 --> 04:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
for asking it uh and the answer is that
 
04:31:01.830 --> 04:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know and that's because this
 
04:31:03.990 --> 04:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
obligation already exists for new
 
04:31:06.790 --> 04:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire attorneys so the our rules of
 
04:31:08.469 --> 04:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
professional conduct basically are
 
04:31:09.990 --> 04:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
ethical rules that are promulgated by
 
04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
 
04:31:15.189 --> 04:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
create supervisory obligations both for
 
04:31:17.110 --> 04:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
attorneys who are managers of their law
 
04:31:17.120 --> 04:31:18.229 align:start position:0%
attorneys who are managers of their law
firms

04:31:18.229 --> 04:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
firms
 
04:31:19.510 --> 04:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
over other attorneys what is in our
 
04:31:23.910 --> 04:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
rules called subordinate attorneys as
 
04:31:26.070 --> 04:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
well as for non-lawyer assistance which
 
04:31:29.030 --> 04:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
includes everyone from a paralegal
 
04:31:31.110 --> 04:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
to the receptionist
 
04:31:31.120 --> 04:31:33.189 align:start position:0%
to the receptionist
and

04:31:33.189 --> 04:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:35.030 --> 04:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
as far as i know
 
04:31:35.040 --> 04:31:36.149 align:start position:0%
as far as i know
the

04:31:36.149 --> 04:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:31:37.830 --> 04:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
the bar in new hampshire has never
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
sought more guidance from the supreme
 
04:31:41.429 --> 04:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
court or from the legislature about how
 
04:31:44.469 --> 04:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
that obligation has to be exercised so i
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:49.910 --> 04:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
our law firm paralegals are supervised
 
04:31:52.469 --> 04:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
in the same way that other attorneys are
 
04:31:54.630 --> 04:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
so they're
 
04:31:56.309 --> 04:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
and for us it varies geographically we
 
04:31:57.910 --> 04:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
have a tiny office in berlin in a big
 
04:32:00.070 --> 04:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
office in manchester
 
04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
but i think it would it's going to
 
04:32:04.149 --> 04:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
depend on the paralegal's level of
 
04:32:06.070 --> 04:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
experience so a 10-year paralegal is not
 
04:32:07.030 --> 04:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
going to need the same amount of
 
04:32:09.670 --> 04:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
supervision that a two-year paralegal is
 
04:32:11.990 --> 04:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
and also on the complexity of the work
 
04:32:13.510 --> 04:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's being done
 
04:32:16.870 --> 04:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
a a complex family law case may require
 
04:32:19.670 --> 04:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
a great deal more trial prep than a
 
04:32:21.269 --> 04:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
fairly straightforward non-payment
 
04:32:23.349 --> 04:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
eviction case so i wish i could give you
 
04:32:26.149 --> 04:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
a you know it's got to be 10 to 1
 
04:32:29.110 --> 04:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
or less but i think it really
 
04:32:31.189 --> 04:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
both does depend on the practice setting
 
04:32:32.630 --> 04:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
and the experience of the people
 
04:32:34.790 --> 04:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
involved and is a question that that
 
04:32:36.389 --> 04:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
already is unanswered for a lot of
 
04:32:39.670 --> 04:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:41.670 --> 04:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo thank you mr
 
04:32:41.680 --> 04:32:42.790 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo thank you mr
chairman

04:32:42.790 --> 04:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:32:45.429 --> 04:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
thank you miss matson dutston um so
 
04:32:47.670 --> 04:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
could we talk about um
 
04:32:50.469 --> 04:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
how the public would be protected if
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
they have a paralegal representing them
 
04:32:55.910 --> 04:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you sir absolutely thanks for the
 
04:32:55.920 --> 04:32:56.870 align:start position:0%
thank you sir absolutely thanks for the
question

04:32:56.870 --> 04:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:32:58.710 --> 04:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
so i think there's there's two different
 
04:32:59.830 --> 04:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
pieces to think about one is
 
04:33:02.070 --> 04:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
professional liability and the other is
 
04:33:03.990 --> 04:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
ethical violations
 
04:33:06.551 --> 04:33:06.561 align:start position:0%
so in the situation where there's an
 
04:33:08.789 --> 04:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
allegation of malpractice
 
04:33:08.799 --> 04:33:10.310 align:start position:0%
allegation of malpractice
the

04:33:10.310 --> 04:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:33:13.349 --> 04:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
the person who is liable there is the
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
firm so if a client were to sue new
 
04:33:18.949 --> 04:33:18.959 align:start position:0%
hampshire legal assistance which we
 
04:33:21.349 --> 04:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
always are hoping is not going to happen
 
04:33:22.949 --> 04:33:22.959 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit is against the firm it's not
 
04:33:25.269 --> 04:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
against the individual lawyer and this
 
04:33:26.551 --> 04:33:26.561 align:start position:0%
bill would
 
04:33:28.629 --> 04:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
because it requires
 
04:33:30.949 --> 04:33:30.959 align:start position:0%
the paraprofessionals to be employed by
 
04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
a firm would mean that liability would
 
04:33:34.789 --> 04:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
lie in that case with the firm as well
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
and this has a requirement of of
 
04:33:38.150 --> 04:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
professional liability insurance
 
04:33:39.590 --> 04:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
coverage so
 
04:33:41.910 --> 04:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
as in any other setting the the insurer
 
04:33:43.830 --> 04:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
would would defend and the policy limits
 
04:33:45.670 --> 04:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
would apply ethical violations are a
 
04:33:47.189 --> 04:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
little bit different because an ethical
 
04:33:49.109 --> 04:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
violation of an individual practitioner
 
04:33:50.629 --> 04:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
at a law firm
 
04:33:53.029 --> 04:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
do not extend to all the other members
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
of the firm and
 
04:33:57.349 --> 04:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
the rules of professional conduct that i
 
04:33:59.750 --> 04:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
referenced before are pretty specific
 
04:34:01.029 --> 04:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
about when
 
04:34:02.869 --> 04:34:02.879 align:start position:0%
an ethical violation of someone that a
 
04:34:04.869 --> 04:34:04.879 align:start position:0%
lawyer is supervising
 
04:34:07.029 --> 04:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
essentially attaches to the supervising
 
04:34:07.039 --> 04:34:08.070 align:start position:0%
essentially attaches to the supervising
lawyer

04:34:08.070 --> 04:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
04:34:10.709 --> 04:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
so for example a supervising lawyer has
 
04:34:12.949 --> 04:34:12.959 align:start position:0%
the obligation to try to prevent or
 
04:34:12.959 --> 04:34:14.551 align:start position:0%
the obligation to try to prevent or
mitigate

04:34:14.551 --> 04:34:14.561 align:start position:0%
mitigate
 
04:34:17.910 --> 04:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:19.429 --> 04:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
but is not
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily liable for um
 
04:34:24.470 --> 04:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
for something that they couldn't have
 
04:34:26.709 --> 04:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
foreseen happening i think that this
 
04:34:28.949 --> 04:34:28.959 align:start position:0%
bill goes a little bit farther by making
 
04:34:28.959 --> 04:34:30.070 align:start position:0%
bill goes a little bit farther by making
it

04:34:30.070 --> 04:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:34:33.429 --> 04:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
clear that there are um
 
04:34:35.910 --> 04:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
there's a statutory obligation as well
 
04:34:37.029 --> 04:34:37.039 align:start position:0%
to ensure
 
04:34:39.109 --> 04:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
the reasonable conduct of the paralegal
 
04:34:40.629 --> 04:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
in addition to the
 
04:34:42.949 --> 04:34:42.959 align:start position:0%
the ethical obligation that
 
04:34:46.470 --> 04:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:47.830 --> 04:34:47.840 align:start position:0%

house two years ago

untimely death because the house and

did but
 
05:39:47.670 --> 05:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
yes it was quite exciting thanks i've um
 
05:39:49.910 --> 05:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
i did that commute from auburn slash

dairy new hampshire to lebanon for two
 
05:39:53.510 --> 05:39:53.520 align:start position:0%

hey can i work from home and i've been
 
05:39:57.990 --> 05:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
remote since then oh good choice i only
 
05:40:00.548 --> 05:40:00.558 align:start position:0%
had to commute from orford to to lime so
 
05:40:02.230 --> 05:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
it wasn't quite as bad
 
05:40:07.910 --> 05:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:12.868 --> 05:40:12.878 align:start position:0%

thank you chairman and members of the

administrator of the drinking water and
 
05:41:08.470 --> 05:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
groundwater bureau at the department of
 
05:41:10.788 --> 05:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
environmental services we're here to
 
05:41:13.270 --> 05:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
testify in support of the bill today and
 
05:41:15.030 --> 05:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
also as you'll note in our
 
05:41:17.430 --> 05:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
testimony letter to request a small
 
05:41:21.830 --> 05:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:24.948 --> 05:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
since 2006 state law has been changed to
 
05:41:26.310 --> 05:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
allow department of environmental
 
05:41:27.670 --> 05:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
services to have
 
05:41:31.430 --> 05:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
very limited access to the e-91 data set
 
05:41:33.750 --> 05:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
and the access we have is essentially
 
05:41:36.390 --> 05:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
an address and a longitude and latitude
 
05:41:38.628 --> 05:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
and so it's really a near perfect set of
 
05:41:40.788 --> 05:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
addresses for the state of new hampshire
 
05:41:42.390 --> 05:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
and we worked with the legislature and
 
05:41:44.868 --> 05:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
department of safety back in 2006 to get
 
05:41:46.230 --> 05:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
access to this
 
05:41:47.830 --> 05:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
because we had a real urgent need for
 
05:41:49.830 --> 05:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
the information at the department one of
 
05:41:51.270 --> 05:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
the things the department that we
 
05:41:51.280 --> 05:41:52.548 align:start position:0%
the things the department that we
oversee

05:41:52.548 --> 05:41:52.558 align:start position:0%
oversee
 
05:41:55.270 --> 05:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
is the construction of water wells and
 
05:41:56.708 --> 05:41:56.718 align:start position:0%
in the state there's about a quarter
 
05:41:58.708 --> 05:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
million what private water wells in the
 
05:41:58.718 --> 05:41:59.990 align:start position:0%
million what private water wells in the
state

05:41:59.990 --> 05:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:42:02.470 --> 05:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
and when people are proposing new large
 
05:42:04.470 --> 05:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
groundwater extractions state law
 
05:42:07.030 --> 05:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
requires that we identify nearby wells
 
05:42:09.110 --> 05:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
and that we assure we assess impacts to
 
05:42:10.548 --> 05:42:10.558 align:start position:0%
those wells before we approve a new
 
05:42:10.558 --> 05:42:11.670 align:start position:0%
those wells before we approve a new
withdrawal

05:42:11.670 --> 05:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
withdrawal
 
05:42:12.708 --> 05:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:42:15.670 --> 05:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
by having this information 9-1-1 we're
 
05:42:18.150 --> 05:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
able to take our well records paper well
 
05:42:20.310 --> 05:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
records which are entered into database
 
05:42:22.470 --> 05:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
and match it with the address of 9-1-1
 
05:42:24.070 --> 05:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
and locate the dots all over the map
 
05:42:25.910 --> 05:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
thus seeing where the wells are and so
 
05:42:27.670 --> 05:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
it saves a lot of work and ensures we're
 
05:42:30.788 --> 05:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
very thorough in assessing impacts
 
05:42:33.110 --> 05:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
more recently the data has been urgent
 
05:42:35.430 --> 05:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
in identifying where private wells are
 
05:42:36.948 --> 05:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
in southern new hampshire you know the
 
05:42:38.390 --> 05:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
population center of our state is
 
05:42:40.070 --> 05:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
contaminated with pfas due to air
 
05:42:40.080 --> 05:42:41.110 align:start position:0%
contaminated with pfas due to air
emissions

05:42:41.110 --> 05:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
05:42:43.350 --> 05:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
and we have teams every day every day
 
05:42:45.430 --> 05:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
since 2016 that are out there and
 
05:42:47.670 --> 05:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
sampling private wells about thousand to
 
05:42:49.430 --> 05:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
date and we have a backlog
 
05:42:51.670 --> 05:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
and again this data helps us identify
 
05:42:53.510 --> 05:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
where the private wells are if you have
 
05:42:54.948 --> 05:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
an address
 
05:42:57.110 --> 05:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
um in an area and you don't have a map
 
05:42:59.350 --> 05:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
water supply line you can
 
05:43:00.708 --> 05:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
guess that there's a private well there
 
05:43:02.390 --> 05:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
because you a property that has an
 
05:43:04.310 --> 05:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
address and what swelling would have a
 
05:43:06.390 --> 05:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
water supply and so if there's no mapped
 
05:43:07.830 --> 05:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
water lines we can find the private
 
05:43:07.840 --> 05:43:08.708 align:start position:0%
water lines we can find the private
wells

05:43:08.708 --> 05:43:08.718 align:start position:0%
wells
 
05:43:11.270 --> 05:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
contact the homeowners and if they want
 
05:43:13.670 --> 05:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
sample their well at no cost and help
 
05:43:16.150 --> 05:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
them with alternative water another
 
05:43:17.990 --> 05:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
thing that we needed access to this data
 
05:43:20.310 --> 05:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
for was improving our understanding of
 
05:43:22.548 --> 05:43:22.558 align:start position:0%
hydrogeology throughout the state the
 
05:43:24.868 --> 05:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
well drillers submit a record to us
 
05:43:26.788 --> 05:43:26.798 align:start position:0%
every time they drill a well
 
05:43:28.788 --> 05:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
it has an address on it
 
05:43:30.628 --> 05:43:30.638 align:start position:0%
and that record shows things like depth
 
05:43:33.030 --> 05:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
of bedrock the type of soil stratigraphy
 
05:43:35.990 --> 05:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
that you have the well yield and by by
 
05:43:37.830 --> 05:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
being able to match those paper records
 
05:43:40.150 --> 05:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
and the technical information on there
 
05:43:43.990 --> 05:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
with the e911 vocational data all sudden
 
05:43:45.830 --> 05:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
you can create cross-sections and maps
 
05:43:48.470 --> 05:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
of the state to help with water water
 
05:43:50.548 --> 05:43:50.558 align:start position:0%
resource studies which is critical for
 
05:43:52.310 --> 05:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
communities and throughout the state as
 
05:43:56.310 --> 05:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
they try to develop new water resources
 
05:43:58.470 --> 05:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
so it served us very well the data's
 
05:44:00.230 --> 05:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
been controlled we only use it for the
 
05:44:02.390 --> 05:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
purposes i have we cannot share it with
 
05:44:05.590 --> 05:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
others even at a right to know
 
05:44:08.470 --> 05:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
this bill kind of rewords things to make
 
05:44:10.150 --> 05:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
more clear what the department has
 
05:44:12.070 --> 05:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
access to and when safety has to provide
 
05:44:13.990 --> 05:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
it and we're fine with that approach
 
05:44:16.708 --> 05:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
but we have one more need for this data
 
05:44:18.628 --> 05:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
based on some federal requirements and
 
05:44:20.868 --> 05:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
that's where we ask for the amendment
 
05:44:22.708 --> 05:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
right now the statute says we can access
 
05:44:25.510 --> 05:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
e911 data to locate private wells and
 
05:44:27.350 --> 05:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
that's all we're using it for
 
05:44:30.628 --> 05:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
but now per us epa we have to develop
 
05:44:33.190 --> 05:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
lead service line inventories for every
 
05:44:34.868 --> 05:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
service connection to a public water
 
05:44:37.670 --> 05:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
system in the state by october 2024
 
05:44:39.350 --> 05:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
and so you'll see on the second page of
 
05:44:41.430 --> 05:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
the letter and there's a map
 
05:44:42.948 --> 05:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
and that's the kind of data we're going
 
05:44:44.548 --> 05:44:44.558 align:start position:0%
to have to generate for
 
05:44:46.390 --> 05:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
potentially a few hundred thousand sites
 
05:44:48.948 --> 05:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
in the state an inventory of every line
 
05:44:50.310 --> 05:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
associated with the water system going
 
05:44:53.110 --> 05:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
to a dwelling and identify if it has a
 
05:44:55.030 --> 05:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
lead service line if it might have lead
 
05:44:56.948 --> 05:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
joints if it's galvanized that might
 
05:44:58.628 --> 05:44:58.638 align:start position:0%
require replacement because of some like
 
05:44:58.638 --> 05:45:00.150 align:start position:0%
require replacement because of some like
components

05:45:00.150 --> 05:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
components
 
05:45:02.310 --> 05:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
and then ultimately we have to work the
 
05:45:04.470 --> 05:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
water systems to come up with plans to
 
05:45:07.190 --> 05:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
replace all those lead service lines
 
05:45:09.830 --> 05:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
the federal government has put 150
 
05:45:11.590 --> 05:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars towards this for new
 
05:45:14.070 --> 05:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire for the next five years and so
 
05:45:15.670 --> 05:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
we have money to start working on the
 
05:45:15.680 --> 05:45:16.948 align:start position:0%
we have money to start working on the
inventories

05:45:16.948 --> 05:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
inventories
 
05:45:19.510 --> 05:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
and the replacement of those lines
 
05:45:23.110 --> 05:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
having this address that um data set for
 
05:45:24.868 --> 05:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
this purpose gives us a really clean
 
05:45:26.310 --> 05:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
starting point i mean one way or another
 
05:45:27.590 --> 05:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have a list of addresses for
 
05:45:29.590 --> 05:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
the federal requirements but with the
 
05:45:31.670 --> 05:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
perfect naming convention
 
05:45:33.750 --> 05:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
um you know streets being spelled out
 
05:45:35.590 --> 05:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
versus abbreviated and having the
 
05:45:37.670 --> 05:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
location information it just gives us a
 
05:45:39.750 --> 05:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
really clean base to start from so we
 
05:45:42.070 --> 05:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
don't have to recreate the wheel and
 
05:45:43.590 --> 05:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
frankly with something to be less it
 
05:45:45.830 --> 05:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
would be imp less perfect than what we
 
05:45:48.230 --> 05:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
have with the 911 data again it would be
 
05:45:50.150 --> 05:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
controlled where we're not looking for
 
05:45:52.548 --> 05:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
any personal information or structural
 
05:45:53.910 --> 05:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
value information or anything it's just
 
05:45:55.670 --> 05:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
the longitude latitude and dots just
 
05:45:57.510 --> 05:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
like we have now for wells and just like
 
05:45:59.910 --> 05:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
you kind of see on that map
 
05:46:02.150 --> 05:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
on the second page of the letter
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:13.270 --> 05:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:15.910 --> 05:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative lorenzo thank you for
 
05:46:17.430 --> 05:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you mr
 
05:46:20.628 --> 05:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
chairman um as far as the lead pipes and
 
05:46:23.430 --> 05:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
lead lines has there ever been like a
 
05:46:25.110 --> 05:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
cut off as to when
 
05:46:27.430 --> 05:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know builders could
 
05:46:31.110 --> 05:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
have to stop using lead and making lines
 
05:46:33.990 --> 05:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
it there's been steady um improvements
 
05:46:35.590 --> 05:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
in the federal state drinking water act
 
05:46:37.350 --> 05:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
that have limited amount of lead it's
 
05:46:39.830 --> 05:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
never been a clean cut off
 
05:46:41.350 --> 05:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
but over time and i could give you the
 
05:46:43.590 --> 05:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
history of it the percentage of the
 
05:46:44.948 --> 05:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
components that had lead have been
 
05:46:47.110 --> 05:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
reduced over and over the most recent
 
05:46:47.120 --> 05:46:47.910 align:start position:0%
reduced over and over the most recent
one

05:46:47.910 --> 05:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:46:50.310 --> 05:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
fixed a big problem where it said the
 
05:46:52.070 --> 05:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
lead can't be in the wetted area of a
 
05:46:54.230 --> 05:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
fixture and that was even though it was
 
05:46:55.750 --> 05:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
a small percentage it was still getting
 
05:46:57.350 --> 05:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
in the water
 
05:46:58.310 --> 05:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
05:47:00.390 --> 05:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean going forward new
 
05:47:02.150 --> 05:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
construction does not have lead but it's
 
05:47:03.910 --> 05:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
all over the place going back in time
 
05:47:06.230 --> 05:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
especially from the 60s on
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:12.150 --> 05:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:14.788 --> 05:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
i did have one question on the bill and
 
05:47:18.150 --> 05:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
that is in the current law
 
05:47:20.788 --> 05:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
it makes a specific provision that says
 
05:47:22.310 --> 05:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
05:47:24.230 --> 05:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
shall not release
 
05:47:26.948 --> 05:47:26.958 align:start position:0%
shared data under rsa 91a
 
05:47:29.430 --> 05:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
and then in the proposal it also
 
05:47:31.190 --> 05:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
indicates that
 
05:47:33.350 --> 05:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
data wouldn't be released under 91a but
 
05:47:36.310 --> 05:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
in your amendment
 
05:47:38.628 --> 05:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
it doesn't specifically provide for that
 
05:47:41.750 --> 05:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
even though i know you said that
 
05:47:43.750 --> 05:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
our amendments intended just to add
 
05:47:45.910 --> 05:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
language to say in addition to private
 
05:47:48.310 --> 05:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
wells led service lines and we're not
 
05:47:49.830 --> 05:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
trying to alter
 
05:47:51.670 --> 05:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
the other provisions of the existing law
 
05:47:54.230 --> 05:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
that we as the amendment wasn't whole
 
05:47:56.230 --> 05:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
for the whole proposed bill it was just
 
05:47:58.628 --> 05:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
for that one section talking about what
 
05:48:00.310 --> 05:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
we can do with the
 
05:48:00.320 --> 05:48:05.430 align:start position:0%
we can do with the
data

05:48:05.430 --> 05:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:08.230 --> 05:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
okay i think i understand
 
05:48:10.868 --> 05:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
representative langley
 
05:48:12.470 --> 05:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:48:14.310 --> 05:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:48:17.670 --> 05:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
um on line 26 you are on line 28 you
 
05:48:19.670 --> 05:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
talk about the resources
 
05:48:21.590 --> 05:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
um the demand
 
05:48:24.470 --> 05:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
from the department in terms of
 
05:48:27.270 --> 05:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
deleting the data that won't be sent
 
05:48:29.590 --> 05:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
over just the addre the addresses and
 
05:48:31.830 --> 05:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
location will be sent over do you are
 
05:48:33.110 --> 05:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
you going to have the resources
 
05:48:35.110 --> 05:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
available to
 
05:48:37.110 --> 05:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
delete the remaining data that's in the
 
05:48:39.670 --> 05:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
911 information so that it can be sent
 
05:48:41.270 --> 05:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
over to your department
 
05:48:43.270 --> 05:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
or will do you know if they have that
 
05:48:47.190 --> 05:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
resource yes it's um quite easy to
 
05:48:50.070 --> 05:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
to restrict data it's in data and
 
05:48:51.750 --> 05:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
columns and you essentially pick the
 
05:48:53.830 --> 05:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
columns that you want to transfer and so
 
05:48:55.910 --> 05:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
already when we have safety for the
 
05:48:57.830 --> 05:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
information not to minimize the level of
 
05:48:57.840 --> 05:48:58.708 align:start position:0%
information not to minimize the level of
effort

05:48:58.708 --> 05:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
effort
 
05:49:01.590 --> 05:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
within a usually a few hours the data is
 
05:49:03.110 --> 05:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
ready and it's just the longitude
 
05:49:06.070 --> 05:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
latitude and the address it's no effort
 
05:49:09.750 --> 05:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
to really strip it thank you
 
05:49:11.830 --> 05:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:49:13.750 --> 05:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
05:49:16.070 --> 05:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair of
 
05:49:17.350 --> 05:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
there are already
 
05:49:19.990 --> 05:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
commercial databases that have a vast
 
05:49:21.590 --> 05:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
majority of the street addresses in new
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire and nationwide
 
05:49:25.350 --> 05:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
maps spotted
 
05:49:27.830 --> 05:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
so let's see uh
 
05:49:29.910 --> 05:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
let's see so i guess the advantage of
 
05:49:33.110 --> 05:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
this database is uh the cost would be
 
05:49:35.910 --> 05:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh nominal or probably free and then
 
05:49:38.150 --> 05:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's more accurate data or what is that
 
05:49:40.070 --> 05:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
why you do that why you want to do this
 
05:49:41.750 --> 05:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
or is there something preventing you
 
05:49:43.110 --> 05:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
from using
 
05:49:44.788 --> 05:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
you know like google maps
 
05:49:45.990 --> 05:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
there's a database there and then
 
05:49:47.430 --> 05:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
there's openstreetmap and other
 
05:49:49.430 --> 05:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
databases so
 
05:49:51.590 --> 05:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
looks like mr pesky is
 
05:49:53.190 --> 05:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
that's gesturing too that's a great
 
05:49:53.200 --> 05:49:54.628 align:start position:0%
that's gesturing too that's a great
question

05:49:54.628 --> 05:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:49:57.270 --> 05:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
so there would be a cost we are funded
 
05:49:59.030 --> 05:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
to do this work and if we ever lost
 
05:50:00.708 --> 05:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
access to the normal data we would go
 
05:50:03.190 --> 05:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
spend the money on inferior data from
 
05:50:04.708 --> 05:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
the private companies
 
05:50:06.948 --> 05:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
the beauty of 9-1-1 is that someone has
 
05:50:09.590 --> 05:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
gone out and taken measurements and
 
05:50:11.990 --> 05:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
located that driveway cut that building
 
05:50:13.830 --> 05:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
so you know it's accurate where
 
05:50:15.750 --> 05:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
these other commercial services are
 
05:50:17.670 --> 05:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
interpolating and they're pretty
 
05:50:19.510 --> 05:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
accurate don't get me wrong but they can
 
05:50:22.310 --> 05:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
can be way off at times and just because
 
05:50:23.990 --> 05:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
they haven't actually gone out in truth
 
05:50:26.310 --> 05:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
each address as required by 9-1-1 really
 
05:50:30.070 --> 05:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
when they you set that up in a town
 
05:50:30.080 --> 05:50:32.868 align:start position:0%
when they you set that up in a town
questions

05:50:32.868 --> 05:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:34.310 --> 05:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
05:50:39.910 --> 05:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:39.920 --> 05:50:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
i'm

05:50:41.510 --> 05:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
05:50:43.030 --> 05:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
not sure i can figure it out entirely
 
05:51:00.230 --> 05:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:00.240 --> 05:51:01.670 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:51:01.670 --> 05:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:51:03.190 --> 05:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
and you could tell us your first name
 
05:51:04.548 --> 05:51:04.558 align:start position:0%
would be helpful certainly good
 
05:51:06.070 --> 05:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is mark doyle i'm the
 
05:51:07.270 --> 05:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
director of the division of emergency
 
05:51:09.110 --> 05:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
services and communications
 
05:51:10.548 --> 05:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
at the new hampshire department of
 
05:51:12.788 --> 05:51:12.798 align:start position:0%
safety overseeing e911
 
05:51:14.230 --> 05:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
and we've heard a lot of talk today
 
05:51:17.030 --> 05:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
about addresses and and verification why
 
05:51:19.590 --> 05:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
it's so important for
 
05:51:21.670 --> 05:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
the two entities behind me environmental
 
05:51:23.350 --> 05:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
services and the gentleman from tomtom
 
05:51:24.948 --> 05:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
to have accurate
 
05:51:27.190 --> 05:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
address information and i always like to
 
05:51:29.110 --> 05:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
hear anecdotally the stories about why
 
05:51:31.510 --> 05:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
everybody wants access to e911's
 
05:51:32.868 --> 05:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
information and what's difference
 
05:51:35.430 --> 05:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
between ours and google maps and apple
 
05:51:37.270 --> 05:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
maps and the like well frankly as you
 
05:51:38.230 --> 05:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
just heard
 
05:51:40.230 --> 05:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
ours is verified meaning we physically
 
05:51:42.230 --> 05:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
send somebody to every address in the
 
05:51:44.868 --> 05:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
state before it's actually put on the
 
05:51:47.510 --> 05:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
town roll to make sure that that address
 
05:51:49.190 --> 05:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
exists that there's a location
 
05:51:50.788 --> 05:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
identified with it that there's a curb
 
05:51:52.948 --> 05:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
cut matching that address location and
 
05:51:55.030 --> 05:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
at this longitudinal attitude associated
 
05:51:56.150 --> 05:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
with it
 
05:51:58.628 --> 05:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
and not downplaying apple maps or google
 
05:52:00.310 --> 05:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
maps but the reason we do that we go to
 
05:52:02.150 --> 05:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
that extremes because our first
 
05:52:04.230 --> 05:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
responder stakeholders our partners rely
 
05:52:05.430 --> 05:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
on that to make sure that we can
 
05:52:07.030 --> 05:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
provision them and they can provision
 
05:52:08.390 --> 05:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
emergency services
 
05:52:11.110 --> 05:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
to any physical address in town
 
05:52:12.310 --> 05:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
the town that they're responding to and
 
05:52:14.150 --> 05:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction over
 
05:52:16.070 --> 05:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
when we spoke with the folks at
 
05:52:17.430 --> 05:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
environmental services about this
 
05:52:19.190 --> 05:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
particular amendment obviously our
 
05:52:20.868 --> 05:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
concern was making sure that any
 
05:52:22.628 --> 05:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
information that we provide to any
 
05:52:22.638 --> 05:52:23.670 align:start position:0%
information that we provide to any
entity

05:52:23.670 --> 05:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
entity
 
05:52:25.350 --> 05:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
is confidential
 
05:52:26.788 --> 05:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
in the event that any personally
 
05:52:28.628 --> 05:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
identifiable information goes along with
 
05:52:30.310 --> 05:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
that data stream so when we talk to the
 
05:52:32.310 --> 05:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
folks at environmental services as you
 
05:52:33.430 --> 05:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
had just heard they're looking for
 
05:52:35.190 --> 05:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
literally just a plot on the map that
 
05:52:37.750 --> 05:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
has an address affixed to a street and a
 
05:52:39.270 --> 05:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
longitudinal attitude that goes along
 
05:52:40.548 --> 05:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
with it which is something that we can
 
05:52:42.708 --> 05:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
do in with very little difficulty that
 
05:52:45.990 --> 05:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
we currently provide them upon request
 
05:52:47.350 --> 05:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
the one thing that we always want to
 
05:52:49.110 --> 05:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
make sure of though is that whenever we
 
05:52:50.788 --> 05:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
provision any information like that that
 
05:52:52.390 --> 05:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's safeguarded and controlled and the
 
05:52:53.830 --> 05:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
folks at environmental services have
 
05:52:55.510 --> 05:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
done a remarkable job of making sure
 
05:52:57.510 --> 05:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
that that information is confidential
 
05:52:59.750 --> 05:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
and held in the highest regard when it
 
05:53:01.510 --> 05:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
comes to maintaining it and that you
 
05:53:03.430 --> 05:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
always get hurt as well it's not
 
05:53:05.990 --> 05:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
available through a 91a request per
 
05:53:06.000 --> 05:53:07.190 align:start position:0%
available through a 91a request per
statute

05:53:07.190 --> 05:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:53:09.750 --> 05:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
much the way 91a
 
05:53:09.760 --> 05:53:11.110 align:start position:0%
much the way 91a
requests

05:53:11.110 --> 05:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
requests
 
05:53:13.110 --> 05:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
aren't available to anybody petitioning
 
05:53:15.430 --> 05:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
e911 for those records we have the same
 
05:53:17.110 --> 05:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
confidentiality associated with the
 
05:53:19.270 --> 05:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
records that we have that we hold that
 
05:53:21.270 --> 05:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
we create and that we provision in this
 
05:53:22.708 --> 05:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
case at least department of
 
05:53:24.628 --> 05:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
05:53:26.310 --> 05:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
nothing should really change too too
 
05:53:28.628 --> 05:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
much with regard to our ability to
 
05:53:30.470 --> 05:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
provide that information we will work
 
05:53:32.150 --> 05:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
closely with them to find out exactly
 
05:53:33.430 --> 05:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
what it is that they're looking for if
 
05:53:35.030 --> 05:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's anything different
 
05:53:36.548 --> 05:53:36.558 align:start position:0%
but we'll make sure that any provision
 
05:53:38.150 --> 05:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
or any information that we do provide to
 
05:53:40.230 --> 05:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
environmental services will be in such a
 
05:53:42.070 --> 05:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
way that it'll be confidentially handled
 
05:53:43.270 --> 05:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
and then it will be maintained in a
 
05:53:44.788 --> 05:53:44.798 align:start position:0%
confidential manner
 
05:53:46.628 --> 05:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
and that it will be
 
05:53:48.150 --> 05:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
dealt with accordingly in the event that
 
05:53:51.350 --> 05:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
it has to be destroyed or discarded
 
05:53:52.548 --> 05:53:52.558 align:start position:0%
part one
 
05:53:54.470 --> 05:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
part two when i had an opportunity just
 
05:53:55.910 --> 05:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
at the very last minute the 12th hour
 
05:53:57.510 --> 05:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday to talk to tim bethke from
 
05:53:58.708 --> 05:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
time time
 
05:54:00.708 --> 05:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
we talked very quickly about what it is
 
05:54:02.628 --> 05:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
that he's looking for to be able to
 
05:54:04.310 --> 05:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
allow people that are using that
 
05:54:07.590 --> 05:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
navigation system to use the accurate
 
05:54:09.190 --> 05:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
data that is available
 
05:54:12.470 --> 05:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
right now out there which as you heard
 
05:54:14.230 --> 05:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
isn't i don't want to say as reliable
 
05:54:15.830 --> 05:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
but again i like to hear that it's
 
05:54:17.670 --> 05:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
verified address information it's true
 
05:54:19.750 --> 05:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
to form and it's something that maybe
 
05:54:21.350 --> 05:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
other entities would like to have access
 
05:54:23.750 --> 05:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
to as well our concern with is that it
 
05:54:25.190 --> 05:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
potentially could be a slippery slope
 
05:54:26.868 --> 05:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
and what is it exactly that they are
 
05:54:29.190 --> 05:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
looking for if we're provisioning
 
05:54:30.948 --> 05:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
information such as center line data
 
05:54:32.470 --> 05:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
which is an address point on a street
 
05:54:33.990 --> 05:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
the center line of the street that's one
 
05:54:35.750 --> 05:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
thing but if we're
 
05:54:38.150 --> 05:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
provisioning address data which is very
 
05:54:39.830 --> 05:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
more much more or could potentially be
 
05:54:42.310 --> 05:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
much more detailed meaning street
 
05:54:44.548 --> 05:54:44.558 align:start position:0%
addresses based upon driveways and long
 
05:54:46.708 --> 05:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
driveways and private roads and in some
 
05:54:48.470 --> 05:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
cases we've actually gone to the degree
 
05:54:50.548 --> 05:54:50.558 align:start position:0%
to allow first responders greater access
 
05:54:52.708 --> 05:54:52.718 align:start position:0%
and far more detailed access to that
 
05:54:52.718 --> 05:54:53.990 align:start position:0%
and far more detailed access to that
information

05:54:53.990 --> 05:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:54:56.230 --> 05:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
building information in terms of attra
 
05:54:58.708 --> 05:54:58.718 align:start position:0%
access to and entrances to and egresses
 
05:55:00.868 --> 05:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
from specific buildings that's much more
 
05:55:03.510 --> 05:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
detailed information that i do not feel
 
05:55:05.750 --> 05:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable providing to anybody outside
 
05:55:08.070 --> 05:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
of e-911 and the first responder
 
05:55:09.910 --> 05:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
community that we work with what i would
 
05:55:11.350 --> 05:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
like to do is have an opportunity to
 
05:55:13.750 --> 05:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
speak in greater detail with uh tim to
 
05:55:15.990 --> 05:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
find out if there's any more information
 
05:55:17.830 --> 05:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
that they're looking for in terms of
 
05:55:19.590 --> 05:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
just centerline data that we're going to
 
05:55:21.270 --> 05:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
be providing to environmental services
 
05:55:22.708 --> 05:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
at least in this particular case based
 
05:55:23.750 --> 05:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
upon the amendment that they want to
 
05:55:23.760 --> 05:55:25.190 align:start position:0%
upon the amendment that they want to
make

05:55:25.190 --> 05:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
make
 
05:55:26.628 --> 05:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
i'm available for any questions that any
 
05:55:28.548 --> 05:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
folks might have
 
05:55:31.030 --> 05:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
are there questions yes
 
05:55:33.110 --> 05:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
05:55:37.270 --> 05:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:37.280 --> 05:55:38.548 align:start position:0%
 
in

05:55:38.548 --> 05:55:38.558 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:55:42.310 --> 05:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
those circumstances where you are
 
05:55:45.110 --> 05:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
providing or might be providing
 
05:55:45.120 --> 05:55:47.030 align:start position:0%
providing or might be providing
information

05:55:47.030 --> 05:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:55:50.708 --> 05:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
um to an entity other than
 
05:55:54.310 --> 05:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
another state agency
 
05:55:55.510 --> 05:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
are you
 
05:55:55.520 --> 05:55:57.110 align:start position:0%
are you
charging

05:55:57.110 --> 05:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
charging
 
05:55:57.120 --> 05:55:58.150 align:start position:0%
charging
for

05:55:58.150 --> 05:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:56:01.350 --> 05:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
providing that information
 
05:56:02.868 --> 05:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question that it's
 
05:56:04.230 --> 05:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
actually a very good question because
 
05:56:05.670 --> 05:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
right now we don't provide any
 
05:56:07.430 --> 05:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
information to any other agency other
 
05:56:09.430 --> 05:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
than a state or local agency when they
 
05:56:10.788 --> 05:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
request it the only time that we can
 
05:56:12.230 --> 05:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
provide a local agency with that
 
05:56:12.240 --> 05:56:13.270 align:start position:0%
provide a local agency with that
information

05:56:13.270 --> 05:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:56:15.110 --> 05:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
is based upon a request from a town or
 
05:56:16.548 --> 05:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
assessing department that needs that
 
05:56:17.990 --> 05:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
information for accurate address
 
05:56:19.910 --> 05:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
verification or for a local law
 
05:56:21.430 --> 05:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency that's conducting a
 
05:56:22.948 --> 05:56:22.958 align:start position:0%
law enforcement investigation and needs
 
05:56:25.030 --> 05:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
our records pursuant to an investigation
 
05:56:26.788 --> 05:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
and no we do not charge anybody for that
 
05:56:26.798 --> 05:56:29.510 align:start position:0%
and no we do not charge anybody for that
information

05:56:29.510 --> 05:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:32.470 --> 05:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
good follow-up you may and is that
 
05:56:32.480 --> 05:56:35.830 align:start position:0%
good follow-up you may and is that
because

05:56:35.830 --> 05:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:38.788 --> 05:56:38.798 align:start position:0%
you are dealing with
 
05:56:41.030 --> 05:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
other public
 
05:56:44.868 --> 05:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:47.990 --> 05:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
and would that position change if you
 
05:56:48.000 --> 05:56:49.350 align:start position:0%
and would that position change if you
were

05:56:49.350 --> 05:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
were
 
05:56:54.070 --> 05:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:56.470 --> 05:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
entities that aren't part of the state
 
05:56:58.708 --> 05:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
or local government
 
05:57:00.628 --> 05:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question another good
 
05:57:02.390 --> 05:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
question and to be honest with you we've
 
05:57:04.230 --> 05:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
not explored that option at all and the
 
05:57:05.270 --> 05:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
answer to your first part of the
 
05:57:07.190 --> 05:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
question is yes we've never
 
05:57:09.110 --> 05:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
considered or even thought about
 
05:57:11.670 --> 05:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
charging another state agency or a local
 
05:57:14.150 --> 05:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
agency that relies on on our our data we
 
05:57:17.990 --> 05:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
look at it as because of the necessary
 
05:57:19.910 --> 05:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
response required
 
05:57:22.230 --> 05:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
for a 9-1-1 action
 
05:57:23.510 --> 05:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that people are
 
05:57:25.510 --> 05:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
getting there and don't are not going to
 
05:57:27.430 --> 05:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
be held up because they couldn't afford
 
05:57:29.190 --> 05:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
to pay for data that we're provisioning
 
05:57:31.350 --> 05:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
to them it's going to be out there it's
 
05:57:32.868 --> 05:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
something that they're already
 
05:57:34.708 --> 05:57:34.718 align:start position:0%
paying for in a more or less example
 
05:57:35.750 --> 05:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
05:57:38.230 --> 05:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
that every town and entity has
 
05:57:43.030 --> 05:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:46.070 --> 05:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
mike in my 911 to charge a jurisdiction
 
05:57:47.510 --> 05:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
for the data that we should be providing
 
05:57:49.270 --> 05:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
to them anyway so that the citizens of
 
05:57:51.190 --> 05:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
this state get only the highest level in
 
05:57:52.390 --> 05:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
quality of service from their first
 
05:57:54.470 --> 05:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
responders that we can assist in doing
 
05:57:57.430 --> 05:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
05:57:58.390 --> 05:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:58:00.628 --> 05:58:00.638 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
05:58:02.070 --> 05:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:58:03.190 --> 05:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:58:05.270 --> 05:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
just uh looking for some kind of
 
05:58:07.270 --> 05:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
background on
 
05:58:09.030 --> 05:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
the and i don't know how if you're
 
05:58:10.470 --> 05:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
you've been with the
 
05:58:13.030 --> 05:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
agency long enough to know the history
 
05:58:13.040 --> 05:58:14.708 align:start position:0%
agency long enough to know the history
of

05:58:14.708 --> 05:58:14.718 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:58:16.548 --> 05:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
the origin of the
 
05:58:16.558 --> 05:58:17.990 align:start position:0%
the origin of the
e-911

05:58:17.990 --> 05:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
e-911
 
05:58:18.000 --> 05:58:18.788 align:start position:0%
e-911
and

05:58:18.788 --> 05:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:58:20.948 --> 05:58:20.958 align:start position:0%
perhaps discussions about collecting
 
05:58:23.830 --> 05:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
this data and concerns about privacy
 
05:58:26.070 --> 05:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
where their assurance is given that this
 
05:58:27.910 --> 05:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
data would be kept
 
05:58:30.628 --> 05:58:30.638 align:start position:0%
totally within your system at the time
 
05:58:32.390 --> 05:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question and there
 
05:58:34.628 --> 05:58:34.638 align:start position:0%
were we have
 
05:58:36.470 --> 05:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of historical
 
05:58:39.590 --> 05:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
documentation from back in the mid and
 
05:58:42.868 --> 05:58:42.878 align:start position:0%
early 90s when e911 was brought up to
 
05:58:42.878 --> 05:58:44.070 align:start position:0%
early 90s when e911 was brought up to
operation

05:58:44.070 --> 05:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
operation
 
05:58:45.590 --> 05:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the discussion that
 
05:58:47.910 --> 05:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
happened from the then director to a lot
 
05:58:50.868 --> 05:58:50.878 align:start position:0%
of the city and town councils and town
 
05:58:52.150 --> 05:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
fathers and
 
05:58:53.830 --> 05:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
managers and mayors in these cities that
 
05:58:56.070 --> 05:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
we went to to talk to
 
05:58:57.910 --> 05:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
public safety entities and local
 
05:59:00.150 --> 05:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions about what 9-1-1 was and
 
05:59:01.590 --> 05:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
the concerns that a lot of folks would
 
05:59:02.708 --> 05:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
have were
 
05:59:04.628 --> 05:59:04.638 align:start position:0%
just that would our confidential
 
05:59:06.470 --> 05:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
information about our addresses and like
 
05:59:06.480 --> 05:59:07.190 align:start position:0%
information about our addresses and like
be

05:59:07.190 --> 05:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:59:09.190 --> 05:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
disclosed and how are we going to
 
05:59:11.510 --> 05:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
collect that information a lot of work
 
05:59:13.270 --> 05:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
went into making sure that people were
 
05:59:15.270 --> 05:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
aware in the various towns and cities
 
05:59:17.750 --> 05:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
the 200 plus that we visited around the
 
05:59:20.150 --> 05:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
state back in the early 90s to make sure
 
05:59:21.510 --> 05:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
that they were aware that was going to
 
05:59:23.270 --> 05:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
be coming and what the reasons were
 
05:59:25.270 --> 05:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
behind what it was that we were doing so
 
05:59:27.110 --> 05:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
much so that in the event that there
 
05:59:30.070 --> 05:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
were questions our personnel our field
 
05:59:31.990 --> 05:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
representatives our address collection
 
05:59:34.470 --> 05:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
team uh we're told that
 
05:59:36.548 --> 05:59:36.558 align:start position:0%
you would maybe needed to have a police
 
05:59:38.948 --> 05:59:38.958 align:start position:0%
escort because people do not trust maybe
 
05:59:40.708 --> 05:59:40.718 align:start position:0%
government coming onto their property or
 
05:59:42.548 --> 05:59:42.558 align:start position:0%
an unknown vehicle driving up their
 
05:59:44.548 --> 05:59:44.558 align:start position:0%
driveway and the like we made sure that
 
05:59:45.910 --> 05:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
the vehicles that they were all using
 
05:59:47.510 --> 05:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
were marked accordingly had a yellow
 
05:59:49.350 --> 05:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
light on the roof where white had giant
 
05:59:51.110 --> 05:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
door seals on the side representing who
 
05:59:52.788 --> 05:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
they were representing that they were
 
05:59:54.708 --> 05:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
from the department of safety so we
 
05:59:56.310 --> 05:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
worked a lot on making sure that the
 
05:59:57.750 --> 05:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
messaging that was appropriate to the
 
05:59:59.510 --> 05:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
job that we were undertaking was out
 
06:00:01.990 --> 06:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
there so folks would have the ability to
 
06:00:03.670 --> 06:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
know it ahead of time
 
06:00:05.030 --> 06:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
and know that the information that we're
 
06:00:06.548 --> 06:00:06.558 align:start position:0%
collecting because of the meetings that
 
06:00:07.590 --> 06:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
we held
 
06:00:11.510 --> 06:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:13.750 --> 06:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
yes you can follow up
 
06:00:13.760 --> 06:00:15.110 align:start position:0%
yes you can follow up
so

06:00:15.110 --> 06:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:00:17.670 --> 06:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
if i go back in my memory to the
 
06:00:19.670 --> 06:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
early 90s
 
06:00:22.230 --> 06:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
gps was
 
06:00:24.868 --> 06:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
kind of newish for the consumer level
 
06:00:28.070 --> 06:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
and telephone technology was
 
06:00:31.590 --> 06:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:33.910 --> 06:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
i can't imagine or can you tell me what
 
06:00:36.310 --> 06:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
what people envisioned at that time as
 
06:00:39.430 --> 06:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
far as this technology going forward
 
06:00:44.470 --> 06:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:46.708 --> 06:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
i think the short answer is i wasn't at
 
06:00:48.788 --> 06:00:48.798 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 then i've been the director since
 
06:00:51.190 --> 06:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh 2017 but i worked in the first
 
06:00:52.868 --> 06:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
responder community
 
06:00:55.430 --> 06:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement for the previous 32
 
06:00:57.190 --> 06:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
years before that and i can tell you
 
06:00:57.200 --> 06:00:58.390 align:start position:0%
years before that and i can tell you
that

06:00:58.390 --> 06:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:01:00.390 --> 06:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
then what we thought was going to be on
 
06:01:02.230 --> 06:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
the horizon isn't close to where it
 
06:01:04.310 --> 06:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
ended up being on the horizon
 
06:01:05.750 --> 06:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's always this vision of where you
 
06:01:07.350 --> 06:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
think that technology is going to go and
 
06:01:09.750 --> 06:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
how it's going to drive your response as
 
06:01:11.750 --> 06:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
a first responder and as first
 
06:01:13.190 --> 06:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
responders went and we're available you
 
06:01:14.310 --> 06:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
always try to take advantage of the
 
06:01:15.910 --> 06:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
latest and greatest technology to make
 
06:01:17.750 --> 06:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
sure that again you're providing that
 
06:01:20.150 --> 06:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
level of service that you need to and
 
06:01:22.628 --> 06:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
that your citizens expect you to 911 is
 
06:01:24.708 --> 06:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
part of that equation too and what we
 
06:01:26.070 --> 06:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure was when we're
 
06:01:28.230 --> 06:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
looking forward how would 9-1-1 play
 
06:01:30.230 --> 06:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
into that so when it came to longitude
 
06:01:32.708 --> 06:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
latitude when it came to tr point
 
06:01:36.548 --> 06:01:36.558 align:start position:0%
gps capabilities and gps capabilities
 
06:01:38.708 --> 06:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
were rough then
 
06:01:41.190 --> 06:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
they're very good now
 
06:01:42.868 --> 06:01:42.878 align:start position:0%
but there's always room for improvement
 
06:01:45.590 --> 06:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
and we knew that having gps capabilities
 
06:01:47.590 --> 06:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
accessible to us whether it was in the
 
06:01:49.990 --> 06:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
car in the fire truck in the ambulance
 
06:01:51.270 --> 06:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
or whether it was going to be available
 
06:01:53.430 --> 06:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
because 911 was giving it to us was
 
06:01:55.190 --> 06:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
something we would certainly be wanting
 
06:01:56.788 --> 06:01:56.798 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of and we have been
 
06:01:58.310 --> 06:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
able to i mean
 
06:02:00.390 --> 06:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
if need be i can give you dozens of
 
06:02:02.628 --> 06:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
stories about how gps location has
 
06:02:04.948 --> 06:02:04.958 align:start position:0%
helped people around the state from car
 
06:02:06.470 --> 06:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
accidents to where they don't know where
 
06:02:08.390 --> 06:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
they are to wilderness rescues etc
 
06:02:10.390 --> 06:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of information
 
06:02:12.390 --> 06:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
that goes into that gps talk technology
 
06:02:15.430 --> 06:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
that we take advantage of we map
 
06:02:17.830 --> 06:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
though and we layer over that gps
 
06:02:19.990 --> 06:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
technology the maps and the addresses
 
06:02:22.310 --> 06:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
that we verify and create for the entire
 
06:02:24.948 --> 06:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
state and that's where that 9-1-1 piece
 
06:02:28.070 --> 06:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:30.390 --> 06:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
so back to the previous question
 
06:02:32.070 --> 06:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
06:02:34.150 --> 06:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
it was it was
 
06:02:36.150 --> 06:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of confidence placed in
 
06:02:36.160 --> 06:02:36.948 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of confidence placed in
your

06:02:36.948 --> 06:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
your
 
06:02:39.830 --> 06:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
you're keeping this data private
 
06:02:41.590 --> 06:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
does this
 
06:02:44.628 --> 06:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:46.548 --> 06:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
in your mind seem to be uh kind of
 
06:02:48.788 --> 06:02:48.798 align:start position:0%
contrary to the the promises that were
 
06:02:48.798 --> 06:02:49.990 align:start position:0%
contrary to the the promises that were
made

06:02:49.990 --> 06:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
made
 
06:02:52.948 --> 06:02:52.958 align:start position:0%
in the in one instance it does in one
 
06:02:54.390 --> 06:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
instance it doesn't depending upon the
 
06:02:55.750 --> 06:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
type of data that
 
06:02:57.430 --> 06:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
anybody might be looking for we talk
 
06:02:59.110 --> 06:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
about centerline data that's one thing
 
06:03:00.310 --> 06:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's stuff that's out there in the
 
06:03:02.070 --> 06:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
public domain and even
 
06:03:03.670 --> 06:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
address information is out there in the
 
06:03:04.948 --> 06:03:04.958 align:start position:0%
public domain if you know where to look
 
06:03:06.390 --> 06:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
for it if you can go on to
 
06:03:08.310 --> 06:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
assessing sites around the state gis
 
06:03:09.510 --> 06:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
sites around the state for local
 
06:03:11.590 --> 06:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions with a little work you can
 
06:03:13.270 --> 06:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
dig deep and to find out where people
 
06:03:14.628 --> 06:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
live and what their addresses are and
 
06:03:16.070 --> 06:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
what kind of house they're living in and
 
06:03:17.590 --> 06:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
what the appraisal is and those kinds of
 
06:03:17.600 --> 06:03:18.470 align:start position:0%
what the appraisal is and those kinds of
things

06:03:18.470 --> 06:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:03:19.910 --> 06:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
and maybe even to the degree that you
 
06:03:21.190 --> 06:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
might be able to see
 
06:03:23.110 --> 06:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh blueprints of homes or buildings i
 
06:03:25.110 --> 06:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
mean some some towns may offer that up
 
06:03:27.190 --> 06:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
as well but it would require a little
 
06:03:28.948 --> 06:03:28.958 align:start position:0%
bit of investigation a little bit more
 
06:03:31.030 --> 06:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
work than what we're currently being
 
06:03:33.430 --> 06:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
able to provide to our
 
06:03:35.350 --> 06:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
our public safety stakeholders which is
 
06:03:37.190 --> 06:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
the entire state map right out of the
 
06:03:42.150 --> 06:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:44.070 --> 06:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
we don't want to be in a position where
 
06:03:45.750 --> 06:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
to your point
 
06:03:48.628 --> 06:03:48.638 align:start position:0%
we've made assurances and promises all
 
06:03:48.638 --> 06:03:49.590 align:start position:0%
we've made assurances and promises all
along

06:03:49.590 --> 06:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
along
 
06:03:50.948 --> 06:03:50.958 align:start position:0%
to let folks know that there's
 
06:03:52.868 --> 06:03:52.878 align:start position:0%
confidentiality associated with the work
 
06:03:54.470 --> 06:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
that we have done
 
06:03:56.310 --> 06:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
and then go back on that by saying well
 
06:03:57.110 --> 06:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to provision that
 
06:03:59.270 --> 06:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
information only but to the other matter
 
06:04:00.628 --> 06:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
is that when we talk about that center
 
06:04:02.948 --> 06:04:02.958 align:start position:0%
line data that's just very basic data
 
06:04:04.788 --> 06:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
information dots on a map that you
 
06:04:06.548 --> 06:04:06.558 align:start position:0%
already heard from
 
06:04:09.110 --> 06:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
mr harris at des talk a little bit about
 
06:04:10.310 --> 06:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's something that we could provide
 
06:04:12.470 --> 06:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
automatically that doesn't release any
 
06:04:14.470 --> 06:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
of that confidentiality that we made
 
06:04:16.788 --> 06:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
assurances of before
 
06:04:19.110 --> 06:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:04:22.708 --> 06:04:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:25.430 --> 06:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is have you seen the
 
06:04:27.510 --> 06:04:27.520 align:start position:0%

the one reference to line 14
 
06:04:33.440 --> 06:04:34.390 align:start position:0%

and
 
06:04:39.430 --> 06:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
i guess the question is is that
 
06:04:41.030 --> 06:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
acceptable to you
 
06:04:44.070 --> 06:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
it is
 
06:04:44.080 --> 06:04:45.270 align:start position:0%
it is
and

06:04:45.270 --> 06:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:04:48.310 --> 06:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
if i could just follow up on that the
 
06:04:51.110 --> 06:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
this replaces what was previously in
 
06:04:52.948 --> 06:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
part b
 
06:04:54.868 --> 06:04:54.878 align:start position:0%

of that paragraph
and

and
 
06:04:59.350 --> 06:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
where it previously referenced that
 
06:05:01.510 --> 06:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
the data not be
 
06:05:01.520 --> 06:05:02.548 align:start position:0%

06:05:09.430 --> 06:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
objection if that provision was added in
 
06:05:13.910 --> 06:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:17.670 --> 06:05:17.680 align:start position:0%

you're not going to repeat go over the
 
06:05:36.070 --> 06:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
same things you said before if you have
 
06:05:46.310 --> 06:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:48.310 --> 06:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um a couple things
 
06:05:50.948 --> 06:05:50.958 align:start position:0%
i wanted to bring up real quickly was
 
06:05:53.510 --> 06:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
so where i live in new hampshire auburn
 
06:05:55.990 --> 06:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of addresses that are
 
06:05:58.070 --> 06:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
right on the border one being winchester
 
06:06:00.070 --> 06:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
terrace ones being winchester
 
06:06:00.080 --> 06:06:01.030 align:start position:0%
terrace ones being winchester
away

06:06:01.030 --> 06:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
away
 
06:06:02.548 --> 06:06:02.558 align:start position:0%
if you were to plug that into your gps
 
06:06:04.390 --> 06:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
today it would ask you which direction
 
06:06:06.070 --> 06:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
you want to go winchester terrace or
 
06:06:08.150 --> 06:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
winchester ave
 
06:06:11.270 --> 06:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
winchester uh avenue or a winchester way
 
06:06:12.310 --> 06:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
is on
 
06:06:13.990 --> 06:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
in out in auburn whereas winchester
 
06:06:15.590 --> 06:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
terrace is in
 
06:06:15.600 --> 06:06:16.788 align:start position:0%
terrace is in
derry

06:06:16.788 --> 06:06:16.798 align:start position:0%
derry
 
06:06:17.990 --> 06:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
if you were to if you were having a
 
06:06:19.510 --> 06:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
pizza delivered to your house it would
 
06:06:20.868 --> 06:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
be delivered to
 
06:06:23.030 --> 06:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
right now to terrace because the address
 
06:06:25.510 --> 06:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
of winchester way is not in the database
 
06:06:27.510 --> 06:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't for my work with tomtom
 
06:06:29.030 --> 06:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
that address would not be in most
 
06:06:31.350 --> 06:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
navigation systems today
 
06:06:33.350 --> 06:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
the other example i will give in regards
 
06:06:36.230 --> 06:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
to address points data is
 
06:06:37.590 --> 06:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
i've been with the company obviously for
 
06:06:39.590 --> 06:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
18 years and one of the examples i can
 
06:06:40.788 --> 06:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
give you is
 
06:06:42.470 --> 06:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
i dealt with virginia for the longest
 
06:06:42.480 --> 06:06:43.990 align:start position:0%
i dealt with virginia for the longest
time

06:06:43.990 --> 06:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:06:45.190 --> 06:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
there's a county in virginia that
 
06:06:48.830 --> 06:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
provided me with everybody's personal
 
06:06:51.030 --> 06:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
information i immediately looked at that
 
06:06:52.470 --> 06:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
information and said
 
06:06:53.750 --> 06:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
this is not right
 
06:06:55.430 --> 06:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
i should not have this information this
 
06:06:57.350 --> 06:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
is the early stages of when gps was just
 
06:06:59.910 --> 06:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
coming out with address information
 
06:07:01.670 --> 06:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
i immediately went to my boss said hey
 
06:07:02.948 --> 06:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
i'm going to contact this county tell
 
06:07:03.990 --> 06:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
them i'm removing that personal
 
06:07:05.990 --> 06:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
information i went in there and deleted
 
06:07:07.190 --> 06:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
all that personal information because i
 
06:07:10.310 --> 06:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
felt that was the right thing to do
 
06:07:12.310 --> 06:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
i know for a fact that if there was
 
06:07:14.310 --> 06:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
personal information in the data that
 
06:07:15.590 --> 06:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
was given to me by the state of new
 
06:07:15.600 --> 06:07:16.470 align:start position:0%
was given to me by the state of new
hampshire

06:07:16.470 --> 06:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:07:19.110 --> 06:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
that we would do the right thing
 
06:07:20.868 --> 06:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
i can tell you right now what i've done
 
06:07:23.590 --> 06:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
in the last probably 10 years is gone to
 
06:07:25.190 --> 06:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
most municipalities in the state of new
 
06:07:27.110 --> 06:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire that have have available
 
06:07:29.430 --> 06:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
partial address data and try to create
 
06:07:31.510 --> 06:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
recreate the wheel
 
06:07:33.350 --> 06:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
taking the personal the property
 
06:07:35.270 --> 06:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
identification number and matching it to
 
06:07:38.230 --> 06:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
the publicly available parcel data
 
06:07:40.548 --> 06:07:40.558 align:start position:0%
that that interest information is not
 
06:07:42.310 --> 06:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
totally accurate
 
06:07:44.470 --> 06:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
because that's putting you at a pinpoint
 
06:07:46.548 --> 06:07:46.558 align:start position:0%
in a property that could be
 
06:07:48.708 --> 06:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
many acres wide
 
06:07:50.310 --> 06:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
when seconds count that's one
 
06:07:53.590 --> 06:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
information that is vitally necessary
 
06:07:55.270 --> 06:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
the address information that the 911
 
06:07:57.270 --> 06:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
would be providing would be able to
 
06:07:58.948 --> 06:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
allow people to be navigated correctly
 
06:08:01.430 --> 06:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
especially first responders
 
06:08:01.440 --> 06:08:02.230 align:start position:0%
especially first responders
so

06:08:02.230 --> 06:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:08:03.990 --> 06:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
i would personally would love to be able
 
06:08:05.110 --> 06:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
to see that address information
 
06:08:05.120 --> 06:08:06.150 align:start position:0%
to see that address information
available

06:08:06.150 --> 06:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
available
 
06:08:08.708 --> 06:08:08.718 align:start position:0%
minus any personal information all i
 
06:08:10.708 --> 06:08:10.718 align:start position:0%
want to know is the latin long and that
 
06:08:12.708 --> 06:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
physical address i don't care who lives
 
06:08:14.150 --> 06:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
there i don't care how much the property
 
06:08:16.470 --> 06:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
is i don't care any anything else
 
06:08:18.788 --> 06:08:18.798 align:start position:0%
if i wanted to i would go into access
 
06:08:20.470 --> 06:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
gis or any of the other publicly
 
06:08:23.030 --> 06:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
available parcel databases and utilize
 
06:08:24.310 --> 06:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
that information
 
06:08:28.708 --> 06:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:32.548 --> 06:08:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:34.070 --> 06:08:34.080 align:start position:0%

third
 
06:09:23.110 --> 06:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
for all of the bills that we have heard
 
06:09:25.350 --> 06:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
so far
 
06:09:28.708 --> 06:09:28.718 align:start position:0%
my intention is to have a
 
06:09:30.708 --> 06:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
caucus at least for
 
06:09:34.470 --> 06:09:34.480 align:start position:0%

but the uh
 
06:09:43.910 --> 06:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
all of the bills that we've heard so far
 
06:09:45.350 --> 06:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
have been scheduled for executive
 
06:09:46.548 --> 06:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
session i hope to go through them
 
06:09:48.070 --> 06:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
there's only one bill that we're
 
06:09:50.230 --> 06:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
required to get out at this point in
 
06:09:52.470 --> 06:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
time because it requires a second
 
06:09:54.708 --> 06:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
committee and we'll hear that bill first
 
06:09:55.910 --> 06:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
when he goes through the executive
 
06:09:57.590 --> 06:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
session and my intent would be to go
 
06:09:59.830 --> 06:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
through the other bills
 
06:10:02.390 --> 06:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
in order
 
06:10:03.750 --> 06:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
lowest first
 
06:10:05.030 --> 06:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
unless somebody
 
06:10:07.830 --> 06:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
has wants to move to hear one of the
 
06:10:10.390 --> 06:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
other bills earlier and dispose of it
 
06:10:12.390 --> 06:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
and then we could do that and
 
06:10:14.548 --> 06:10:14.558 align:start position:0%
if at people's request but otherwise
 
06:10:17.270 --> 06:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
we'll just go through them in order
 
06:10:17.280 --> 06:10:18.548 align:start position:0%
we'll just go through them in order
and

06:10:18.548 --> 06:10:18.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:10:20.868 --> 06:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
that's it i guess we're in recess until
 
06:10:22.868 --> 06:10:22.878 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning
 
06:10:29.190 --> 06:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:30.948 --> 06:10:30.958 align:start position:0%

06:10:30.958 --> 06:10:32.070 align:start position:0%
