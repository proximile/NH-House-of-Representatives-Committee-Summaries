working on the amendment
 
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
to this bill is going to be done in a
 
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
separate subcommittee hearing as it is
 
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
as it is a kind of a different topic
 
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
here so
 
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
just as a reminder to everyone this is
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
relative the mental health counseling
 
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.350 align:start position:0%
relative the mental health counseling
compact

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
compact
 
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.110 align:start position:0%
compact
and

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
we did have a public hearing on this
 
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.909 align:start position:0%
we did have a public hearing on this
already

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
we we did entertain several questions in
 
00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 align:start position:0%
reference to the processing of this and
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
how it works
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
in my notes um
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
this would re to freshen everybody back
 
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
up this would require 10 states
 
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
in order for this compact to take effect
 
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
maine maryland alabama louisiana
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
colorado have already enacted this there
 
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
are 15 other states considering this
 
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
compact as well
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
the only other new england state
 
00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
we had a standard series of questions
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
in reference to discipline
 
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
as to which
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
if someone
 
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
commits an act or or there's a problem
 
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
how is that handled we went over that as
 
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.150 align:start position:0%
how is that handled we went over that as
to

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
who gets
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
primary jurisdiction there
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
we were informed the
 
00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
and the board of mental health is well
 
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
today have representative woods with us
 
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
from health and human services who is
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
quite familiar with
 
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
health compacts so i asked him to be on
 
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.749 align:start position:0%
health compacts so i asked him to be on
this

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee as this is a
 
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.070 align:start position:0%
bill that
involves

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
involves
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
health and human services really
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
i will
 
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
entertain any concerns or questions
 
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
anybody has in reference to this
 
00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman i would just like to say
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
that as the vice chairman of the
 
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
telehealth commission we've discussed
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
this at the telehealth commission as
 
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.110 align:start position:0%
this at the telehealth commission as
well

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
and it would certainly make our life a
 
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
lot easier in resolving interstate
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.189 align:start position:0%
 
excellent

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and the other question that
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
was brought up that i brought up that we
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
seem to have a little bit difficulty in
 
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
in getting processed was
 
00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
you know this is a this is a
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
transitional piece of legislation as we
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
are going to be leaving a compact and
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
entering into a different compact
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
and in reference to the processing of
 
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
that do
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
and for those of you that are familiar
 
00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:01.350 align:start position:0%
and for those of you that are familiar
with

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
well computer programming some other
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
things this is kind of an if then
 
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
scenario whereas we are not going to put
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves on the state of new hampshire
 
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
in limbo exiting a compact without
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
entering into a reformed or new compact
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
that so there's that's not going to
 
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
cause new hampshire to become an island
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
in the sense that
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
we've now we've now just
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
so we didn't looking through my notes we
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
anything in the way of objections i
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
don't recall any testimony to the
 
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
contrary that was
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh in in general um in favor of compacts
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
like this that
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
make licensing issues easier and provide
 
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.829 align:start position:0%
make licensing issues easier and provide
services

00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
a problem and a serious objection though
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
to this particular compact the problem
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
is is there's a difference
 
00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:05.430 align:start position:0%
is is there's a difference
between

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.829 align:start position:0%
between
interstate

00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
interstate
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
compacts um
 
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
well let me put it this way
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
figuratively speaking you can't talk
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
somebody down off a building
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
on the phone
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
sure so there's a lot of things that you
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
can do
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm not sure this is one of them
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
i've um like education i
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
am a firm believer that face to face is
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
very important for this particular
 
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.509 align:start position:0%
very important for this particular
practice

00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
but then there's
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
something in here that's a red flag to
 
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.590 align:start position:0%
something in here that's a red flag to
me

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
that if it stays
 
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
i cannot and will not support this bill
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
and that is if you look at
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page
 
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.550 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page
two

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.870 align:start position:0%
two
under

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
roman numeral one
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
to participate in the compact estate
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
most currently
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
the first few things make sense license
 
00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:05.839 align:start position:0%
and regulate licensed professional
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
counselors require licenses to pass
 
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah require licenses so on
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:16.839 align:start position:0%
orientation and ethical
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
practice and and then we get to number
 
00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:20.870 align:start position:0%
practice and and then we get to number
two

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
well under c it's requiring licensees to
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
have a 60 semester hour 90 quarter
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
hour master's degree and so on and so
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
forth right so help me out here because
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
i don't see that on my you're looking at
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
um you'll need the printer on page four
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
to give page in line okay okay thank you
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
on this it's saying page two but it's
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
oh i see okay so on page four line two
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
part c
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
the requirement for 60 semester hour and
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
night right and the first few make
 
00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
perfect sense to me
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
um or most of them make perfect sense to
 
00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:54.550 align:start position:0%
um or most of them make perfect sense to
me

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
then you get to training in social and
 
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.829 align:start position:0%
then you get to training in social and
cultural

00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%
cultural
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
diversity i cannot will not accept this
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
premise any longer i cannot and will not
 
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.590 align:start position:0%
premise any longer i cannot and will not
support

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
any bill
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
that has this type of terminology in it
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
and it's it's
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
it's a poison pill really because then
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
further down it it makes a very
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
under other circumstances very
 
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.069 align:start position:0%
under other circumstances very
reasonable

00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh requirement under number nine in
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
parentheses it says other areas is
 
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
determined by the commission and that
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
fine it's understandable that they need
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
the flexibility
 
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
to add or take out
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
training requirements
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
except that i know
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
i know
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
it's not misinformation or
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
disinformation or conspiracy theorism
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
i know
 
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.230 align:start position:0%
i know
that

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
that leaves the way wide open
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
for somebody to say okay we'll take out
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
social and cultural diversity and we'll
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
leave in number nine and that means
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
social and cultural diversity goes back
 
00:11:58.399 --> 00:11:59.590 align:start position:0%
social and cultural diversity goes back
in

00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
under another name
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
i've had it with social and cultural
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
diversity proclamations cannot and will
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
not support it
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
sorry about that i really am
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.829 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
i think relevant in this world
 
00:12:25.839 --> 00:12:31.350 align:start position:0%
i think relevant in this world
is

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that folks
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
that have a
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
social work differently
 
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.829 align:start position:0%
social work differently
and

00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
i think that that
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
that element of that is something that
 
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.550 align:start position:0%
that element of that is something that
is

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
well integrated into the profession
 
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.949 align:start position:0%
well integrated into the profession
already

00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:12:58.959 --> 00:13:00.790 align:start position:0%
already
um

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
you know and i don't and i don't
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
i don't look at this as that i
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
i don't look at this in the sense of
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
them trying to manipulate that i think
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's just a matter of
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
there are some cultures that just handle
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
this type of thing
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
differently and
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's something that's going to
 
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.430 align:start position:0%
that's something that's going to
exist

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
in in all aspects of this
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
it pro i would imagine it probably does
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
in the current compact
 
00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:39.430 align:start position:0%
in the current compact
so

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
that i mean if that's if that is the
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
ultimate poison pill for you to
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
agree to enter into this compact then
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
i think that you're there's almost no
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
way around that in this in the mental
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
health profession
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
because we can't the state of new
 
00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:56.790 align:start position:0%
because we can't the state of new
hampshire

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.910 align:start position:0%
hampshire
can't

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
pull that out
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
to enter into the compact it's a go or
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
no-go scenario this is the details of
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
that compact but it would it's a matter
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
of do we accept
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
the conditions set forth in the compact
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire or not as
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
a as a mass so representative woods jump
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
in with their certainly as a someone
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
who's extraordinarily familiar with
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
these well i i completely understand and
 
00:14:22.959 --> 00:14:24.069 align:start position:0%
these well i i completely understand and
appreciate

00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
the difficulty that which uh you
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
mentioned however uh
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
this is part
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
for those who don't know where both of
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
us are physicians and i'm uh
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
was new hampshire's delegate to the ama
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
and listened to and served on uh council
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
on science and public health
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh but part of that debate was cultural
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
diversity awareness
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
for the physician that's embedded in our
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
code of ethics which is how physicians
 
00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:51.189 align:start position:0%
code of ethics which is how physicians
are

00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:14:51.199 --> 00:14:52.790 align:start position:0%
are
judged

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
judged
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not talking about the other
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
ancillary nurses and so forth
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
but embedded in there is
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
awareness of cultural diversity and
 
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's impaired in our essay that we
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
have to follow the american code of
 
00:15:05.839 --> 00:15:07.030 align:start position:0%
have to follow the american code of
ethics

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
and by that has meant awareness of
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes simple things like being aware
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
of getting an appointment and realizing
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
that that may be a major holiday for an
 
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.509 align:start position:0%
that that may be a major holiday for an
individual

00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh that say muslim and it's ramadan
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
or being aware that under some
 
00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.110 align:start position:0%
or being aware that under some
circumstances

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh that a a teenage girl even though she
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
may be 16 or 17 can't have an
 
00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:32.389 align:start position:0%
may be 16 or 17 can't have an
appointment

00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
under some circumstances
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
even for a ch i was a hand surgeon
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
checking out a hand problem without her
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
father being there and being aware of
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
that so
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh i appreciate what you're saying but i
 
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.269 align:start position:0%
uh i appreciate what you're saying but i
think

00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:48.470 align:start position:0%
think
uh

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
again i'm reading how they meant this
 
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.590 align:start position:0%
again i'm reading how they meant this
but

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing that we as physicians
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
and i think that would apply here that
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
that's meant to be aware of
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
that so you can better communicate with
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
that particular individual
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh on a one-to-one and a personal basis
 
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:09.829 align:start position:0%
uh on a one-to-one and a personal basis
but

00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
just to reiterate again the way the
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
compacts work is
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh you can't change them uh you it it's
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
it's all or none uh
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
so but having said that uh and i don't
 
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.509 align:start position:0%
so but having said that uh and i don't
um

00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
part of this was not the enabling um
 
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
piece that goes with this
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
and by what i mean by that there is an
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
enabling uh um
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know what you want to call it a
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation shall we say that
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
the the compact organizers put out
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
and in it uh it states as soon as x
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
number of people in this case 10
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
that it goes into effect
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
now the first i forgot usually is five
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
or six or whatever
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
once that has been formulated then rules
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
can be uh promulgated
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
and the first five six or seven are
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
at the table and then can look at rules
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
and make those changes so if you're
 
00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.669 align:start position:0%
and make those changes so if you're
say

00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
they say the first seven
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
that join will be part of this
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
review committee and that then takes
 
00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:16.710 align:start position:0%
review committee and that then takes
place

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
and some small issues can be addressed
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
and they need to be addressed
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
an example is if you look
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh at page and this i see stuck over
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
from when we considered it i forgot it
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
was two years ago
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
um at least on on the uh uh
 
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
397 as amended on page two
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
line 37 it says home state
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
means the member state that is the
 
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
licensee's private primary state of
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
residence well that should be the
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
primary state of practice
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
because and again example is i live in
 
00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.350 align:start position:0%
because and again example is i live in
vermont

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
but i just cross the river and i
 
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.310 align:start position:0%
but i just cross the river and i
practice

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
at dartmouth hitchcock sure so what you
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
want is so
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
this really creates a bit and it was it
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
was pointed out back i forgot when that
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
was now but that line is still in there
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
so those are the kinds of things
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
that this rules committee has the
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
ability to address if you're the first
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
and again i'd i haven't i've not been
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
privy to the enabling
 
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.950 align:start position:0%
privy to the enabling
um

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
piece that goes along parallel with this
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
and you may have that which i don't
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
so there's a number of factors um since
 
00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:30.549 align:start position:0%
so there's a number of factors um since
i'm

00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:31.590 align:start position:0%
i'm
talking

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh this
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
com the concept of compact is part of a
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
national effort uh to make uniform
 
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.990 align:start position:0%
national effort uh to make uniform
standards

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
um and this is uh evolution uh in terms
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
of standards uh my great-grandfather uh
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
was a self-taught horseback doctor out
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
in the plains of texas
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
uh he didn't have to have a board of
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
medicine anything he just you know i'm
 
00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
here i'm i'm the doc i'm and we've
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
progressed along
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
this came through such that uh finally
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
we come uh for specialty training uh for
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
physicians we have the american board of
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
medical specialties
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh such that there's 26 specialties that
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
are recognized and that avoids a lot of
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
quotes certifying agencies
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
like when i chaired the workers comp
 
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
advisory council we looked at people who
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
could do ime their independent medical
 
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.310 align:start position:0%
could do ime their independent medical
evaluations

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
evaluations
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
well turns out if you were certified to
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
do that you could do them
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
well turns out there's 400 at that time
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
there was 450 or so
 
00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.830 align:start position:0%
there was 450 or so
certifying

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
certifying
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
agencies 130 of them in las vegas
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
so that tells you a little bit what they
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
were certified
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh so i got a piece of legislation
 
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.270 align:start position:0%
uh so i got a piece of legislation
passed

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
passed
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
i wasn't in the legislature at the time
 
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
but as a chair of the workers comp
 
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
council to say that in fact to do this
 
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.590 align:start position:0%
council to say that in fact to do this
particular

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
ime or independent medical evaluation
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
you had to be
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
board certified by the one of the 26
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
american board of medical specialties
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
and that gives you a national standard
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
because these are national tests i did
 
00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:10.470 align:start position:0%
because these are national tests i did
orthopedics

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
orthopedics
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
and everybody in their specialty passes
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
boards that gives a standard
 
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.070 align:start position:0%
boards that gives a standard
okay

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh looking at that particular issue i
 
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.110 align:start position:0%
uh looking at that particular issue i
was

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately sued as a matter of fact
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
because someone who was doing imes
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
didn't have wasn't board certified and
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
that aeg's uh got office got involved
 
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.590 align:start position:0%
that aeg's uh got office got involved
and

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
he said we'll take care of it so i got
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
off the hook
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
but there's been this
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
ongoing from my great grandfather doing
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
it on his home american board of medical
 
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.310 align:start position:0%
it on his home american board of medical
specialties

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
specialties
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
to provide national
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
licensure so a national standard to make
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
it so that as a physician i can move
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
from state to state as a patient
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
you can continue your care
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
on a on a standard basis and i think
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's critically important
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
and uh the fsmb or the americans
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
the federation of state medical boards
 
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
has been advocating for national
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
licenses i'll uh
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
this is an example of a type of
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
national licensing
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh for as long as i've been associated
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
with them for 30 some odd years
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
so i view this as a as a progression
 
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh from my great-grandfather through all
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
the certifying agencies in las vegas to
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
a national standard
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh to enhance uh a patient care
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
and in fact i was up until recently also
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
on the telemedicine commission
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh and we heard testimony where in fact
 
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest uses was
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
and it made a huge i mean we're talking
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
big big time impact and the follow-up
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
data shows
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
that there was it was uh efficacious
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
in that particular setting
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh and in fact there was a significant
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
i've forgotten the numbers but
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
significant numbers that preferred
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
rather than having to come in
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh not that they didn't but
 
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.669 align:start position:0%
uh not that they didn't but
so

00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's that progression of our use
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
of technology it'll finally sort itself
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
out how it's used just like a new drug
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
as soon as the drug hits the market boys
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
the use goes
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
off the charts
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
then it drops down and people and then
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
it stabilizes
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
we're doing the same thing with
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
telehealth it's a technology that is
 
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.029 align:start position:0%
telehealth it's a technology that is
just

00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
asking to be used and i often say that
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
medicine's often on the dull edge
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
of technology
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
but in this in a situation
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh medicine is really responding and
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
making good use of it so i'll stop sorry
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
uh going on but that's uh a few extra
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
comments uh on sidebars as well to to
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
piggyback a little bit
 
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
i sit on the ptsd commission and there
 
00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.470 align:start position:0%
i sit on the ptsd commission and there
are

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
people that specialize in that type of
 
00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.590 align:start position:0%
people that specialize in that type of
thing

00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
and in new hampshire
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
i think we have
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
for first responders we have like two
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
for the entire state and that the
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
commission found out in a hurry
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
that without
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
reaching out across new hampshire's
 
00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:14.630 align:start position:0%
reaching out across new hampshire's
borders

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
borders
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
we got a problem and
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
this this is certainly an area where
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
people specialize
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
in some cases the military has folks
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
that have specialized for years and that
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
that's really more military related
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
but there are certain aspects of mental
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
health where there are folks that focus
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
on certain aspects in new hampshire as
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
we all know is a relatively tiny state
 
00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.669 align:start position:0%
we all know is a relatively tiny state
so

00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
in those cases folks may
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
what they what is most cost effective
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
and most productive for them
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
as far as treatment may really rely or
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
require them to to
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
branch out into some other locations and
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
i think that's what
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately the current compact is
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
attempting to do and certainly this one
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
will do as well so
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
that's just an example of how
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
we can't necessarily handle this
 
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.750 align:start position:0%
we can't necessarily handle this
in-house

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
in-house
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair i just wanted to
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
add a couple things to what
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
representative woods just said uh first
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
of all i just checked the website of the
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
mental health counseling compact it goes
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
into effect when 10 states have adopted
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
it and according to their website right
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
now nine states have adopted so
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
if new hampshire adopts this it goes
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
into effect we don't need to worry about
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
contingencies um the the second thing
 
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
regards to the efficacy
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
of telehealth in addressing
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
various behavioral health issues and in
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
fact to do counseling we've heard a
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of data
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
which has been collected by the federal
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
government on to that effect
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
at the telehealth commission
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
they have postponed making a final
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
decision about parity
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
and audio only because they're still
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
collecting data and i recognize that but
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
one of the things that has come out in
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
the commission is that
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
telehealth in this circumstance is is
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily effective and in many
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
ways more effective than in office
 
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
visits because the practitioner
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
through the medium of telehealth is
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
brought into the home of the person
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
being counseled they can see what
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
conditions they live in they can see
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
what other issues that they're dealing
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
with and and they also have a uh
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
essentially 100 um show rate uh so you
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
don't have people not showing up for
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
appointments and that has made the
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
service hugely more effective and it's
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
made this actually a preferred modality
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh for people practicing this kind of of
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
a medicine so i i i think that we need
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
to recognize that that's what the actual
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
so along with that too the the other
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
thing is
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
you know from a licensing standpoint
 
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
right we've
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
in this committee
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
for quite a while have tried to figure
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
out ways to
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
in a lot of the cases of licensing in
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
we've had discussions in here about you
 
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
know reciprocation versus recognition
 
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.710 align:start position:0%
know reciprocation versus recognition
versus

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
versus
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
compacts you know versus
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
because those are all obviously
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
different avenues as far as
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know is my license that i have in
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
vermont recognized is it an equivalent
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
do i have to get a different one and you
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
know we've gone back and forth on
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
several bills this this term in
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
reference to that from everything from
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
mental health to hairdressers frankly um
 
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.269 align:start position:0%
mental health to hairdressers frankly um
so

00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
you know this is one of the things that
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
i think is appealing
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
in the sense that
 
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require the state of new
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.029 align:start position:0%
 
open

00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
up this one i don't this would probably
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
not fall under well plc is okay with it
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
so i guess maybe this would be going to
 
00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
them but they're not gonna have to add
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
staff they're not gonna you know what
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
i'm saying because we're in the compact
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
now it's just recognized
 
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
you see what i'm saying so
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's just the i know this is a
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know this thing's 20 30 something
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
pages long and
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
and the reality of it is is it's it's
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
the details of of what's being presented
 
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
before us
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
in the sense of
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know it advise it's more advisory i
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
mean we can't like i said we can't we
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
can't amend this we can't pick it apart
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
we're either doing it or not and
 
00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:30.799 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
you know i think that
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
it's not perfect there's no doubt i mean
 
00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:35.990 align:start position:0%
it's not perfect there's no doubt i mean
there's

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
but at least
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
i mean you know you have so a lot of
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
these compacts have incentives
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
to be to get in early right because you
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
have rule making councils and things
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
like that if you get in the door early
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
you get it your seat at the table's a
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
little bit bigger
 
00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.750 align:start position:0%
little bit bigger
and

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
you know that's
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that you know i mean
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
things are moving along when we had the
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
public hearing there were only five
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
states that enacted i mean we're at nine
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
so clearly other legislative bodies are
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
are going through their motions of
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
processing this and
 
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.430 align:start position:0%
processing this and
um

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know this sounds like
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
this sounds like it's going to happen so
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
this thing this thing is going to exist
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that was not asked
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
and i didn't think of it really till now
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
is the is the
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
the now nine states that are just
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
waiting on a tenth state
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
i would presume are going to exit
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
whatever existing compacts they have to
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
get into this now we we don't have
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
representatives from other states here
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
to answer that but the current compact
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
that we're in what happens if half the
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
states that
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
that are in the current compact now
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
leave to join this one
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
the compact that we and we don't the
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
compact that we're now involved in is
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
now smaller less effective
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
and and probably chaotic in the in the
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
sense that it you know you've got
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
you've got act you know members of
 
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
it could be could be members of the
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
rulemaking part or the upper part of the
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
administration of that that have exited
 
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.630 align:start position:0%
administration of that that have exited
so

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
um i didn't think to ask that at the
 
00:29:06.559 --> 00:29:07.909 align:start position:0%
um i didn't think to ask that at the
time

00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
yeah generally when a state leaves one
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
contract and joins another they would do
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
the same thing that we're doing in the
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
second half of this bill where when the
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
contingency is met uh it's a repeal and
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
replace and it replaces no i get that
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
but what i'm saying is is that if if
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
because we're in a current compact so if
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
we're in a compact that's currently with
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
15 states and nine of those states leave
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
the compact and enter this new one
 
00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
now we're in a compact we're not a
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
compact in 15 states anymore we're in a
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
compact with six
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
and now you're talking about
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
the efficiency of the compact that you
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
are having
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that we're in a mental
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
health counseling compact at this point
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
in time because this bill is written to
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
make this a new chapter as opposed to or
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
feeling replaced okay because there was
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
so this am i confusing this then with a
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
different color yes the second half of
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
this is a compact which is repeal and
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
replace that's what it is all right so
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
that's the part we're not talking about
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
today gotcha
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
you see my point though not applicable
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
here we'll deal with that monday but
 
00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:10.630 align:start position:0%
here we'll deal with that monday but
um

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
so yeah so i guess we have nothing
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
if we that's right if we have nothing on
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
the mental health side then
 
00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:18.799 align:start position:0%
which is why we have such a shortage of
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
mental health professionals in the state
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
and like i said the ptsd commission was
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
was specifically addressing that
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
um in reference to the that field the
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.830 align:start position:0%
 
in

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
what the bill the ptsd bill that came
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
out really doesn't doesn't address that
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
because it's waiting on this
 
00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.269 align:start position:0%
because it's waiting on this
so

00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
so the commission the ptsd commission is
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
waiting to figure out what we do with
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
this because now
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
at least in their world this opens it up
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
to 10 states
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
and potentially someone that could now
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
decide to specialize
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
because now they're gonna have a client
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
base that's that's large enough to do so
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
so one of the issues we have in the
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
north country is that the counselors who
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
provide this kind of service don't
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
choose to live in that kind of
 
00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:08.310 align:start position:0%
choose to live in that kind of
environment

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
so prior to the advent of telehealth
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
most of these services were basically
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
unavailable up where i live um and the
 
00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:16.630 align:start position:0%
unavailable up where i live um and the
this

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
the availability of these services
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
through telehealth has hugely increased
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
the availability of this kind of service
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
to my constituents
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
just to
 
00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
feed on that as well
 
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
the reason one of the reasons it's
 
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.549 align:start position:0%
the reason one of the reasons it's
really

00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
been so well utilized
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
let's say that your mother dies in san
 
00:31:37.519 --> 00:31:38.870 align:start position:0%
let's say that your mother dies in san
antonio

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
antonio
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
and you go down there and there's a real
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
all kinds of issues and you're beginning
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
to fall apart you can now call
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
also if you're in the north country
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
and you you're trying to get a job and
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
it takes two hours to get to the office
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
your employer really doesn't like you
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
taking the day off
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
once a week or once every two or one
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
whatever it happens to be
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
you can do it on your lunch hour sure
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
you you you get
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
much higher participation
 
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
very lower much lower dropout
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
employers really like it because their
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
employees are healthier
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
and also letting them to even take a day
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
an hour off in the middle of the
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon shall we say
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
they can do that easily
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
in the most instances and that gives
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
a nice
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh expression of concern to the patient
 
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
as well that yeah i'm an employer but
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead take take an hour and they
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
don't have to take the day off
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
so there's many other watersheds that
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
come when this is put in place
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
so i guess the other thing that i'm i'm
 
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
just thinking in reference mark to your
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
your concerns is that
 
00:32:56.559 --> 00:32:57.990 align:start position:0%
your concerns is that
realistically

00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
realistically
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
as you're aware with most compacts
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
they're fluid right so
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
they're fluid in the sense that there
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
are compacts that the state of new
 
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire has entered into that
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
that you know when these when these
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
boards meet can make changes and
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
modifications and really i mean new
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire has a seat at the table and we
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
can object and
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
and or or support whatever is going on
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
and then ultimately if a compact becomes
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
such that
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire finds it
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
unacceptable our option is to leave i
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
mean that's
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
that's really what exists so
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
um and again i'm referring again you
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned it changing things uh and
 
00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.070 align:start position:0%
mentioned it changing things uh and
again

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's not here and you may have them but
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
uh the uh promulgating documents
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
um and those are the rules by which
 
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
things can be changed and the committee
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
when the full committee wants to make
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
they may want to know well how you know
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
what are we restricted in
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
if we do join
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
what kind of restrictions are
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
are there placed
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
and they may want to have those
 
00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.149 align:start position:0%
and they may want to have those
promulgating

00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
promulgating
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
papers in hand um i i didn't bring i
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
didn't uh
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
i didn't actually look for them from our
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
our previous because we had them
 
00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:11.589 align:start position:0%
our previous because we had them
available

00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
and there be maybe some questions uh
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
arises how you you know how can things
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
be modified and how hard or easy it is
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
and we and we've done that i mean we did
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
this we did it last year that we pulled
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
out of an interstate compact because it
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
just wasn't
 
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
it just wasn't functioning for this for
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
us at all so so the state you know we
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature has done it and they
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
will do it if it's necessary we've
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
clearly shown that so
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
the amendment terms are on page 18 lines
 
00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:40.550 align:start position:0%
the amendment terms are on page 18 lines
31-33

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
31-33
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
the compact committee
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
by the member states and no amendment
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
becomes effective until it's ratified
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
into the laws of all the member states
 
00:34:48.079 --> 00:34:48.790 align:start position:0%
into the laws of all the member states
so

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's the first one the second one
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
starts starts on page 19.
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
so i you know i think that that's kind
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
of just where
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
where we're at here do we ultimately do
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
we think that the state of new hampshire
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
will benefit from entering into
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
or not and that's you know and
 
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.230 align:start position:0%
or not and that's you know and
there's

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
we we didn't really other than other
 
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.310 align:start position:0%
we we didn't really other than other
than

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
that issue
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
um there really hasn't been any anybody
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
that's come forward
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
with other objections yet representative
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
so let me step back a moment and see um
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
what else can be done if there are
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
issues with the compact itself because
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
i'm reading through testimony of the
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
director of the oplc and there was an
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
emergency license for 20 20 and 21
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
yep that was issued
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
right can we work that angle instead and
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
so explain those licenses
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
so so what you're uh if i'm
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
understanding what you're asking me
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
instead of entering into a compact this
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
we just we have our own basically
 
00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.510 align:start position:0%
we just we have our own basically
reciprocating

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
reciprocating
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
well the emergency order allowed the
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
oplc to issue um sure the licenses
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
as you and i have
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
discussed uh our
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
well actually a lot of us have discussed
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
our displeasure with using emergency
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
orders for to operate anything so
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
um so at that point i mean
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
if you want to set this up in a
 
00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.310 align:start position:0%
if you want to set this up in a
functional

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
functional
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
way that is
 
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.390 align:start position:0%
way that is
not

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
under that
 
00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.630 align:start position:0%
under that
premise

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
premise
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
then you're talking about either getting
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
into a compact or
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
opening the state up with inventing our
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
own in essence because if we if we were
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
to do reciprocating license agreements
 
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.190 align:start position:0%
to do reciprocating license agreements
with

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
other states we're
 
00:36:53.359 --> 00:36:55.030 align:start position:0%
other states we're
inventing

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
inventing
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
another wheel that already that we
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
already have
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the state of massachusetts
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
is not a participant in the compact at
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
this time and the vast majority of the
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
emergency licenses went to the
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
practitioners in the state of
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
massachusetts so we haven't solved that
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
problem yet the legislature in the state
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
of massachusetts could solve it by
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
adopting this contact as well as several
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
other compacts which the state of new
 
00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire is a part of
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
now the other thing that i didn't see in
 
00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.510 align:start position:0%
now the other thing that i didn't see in
here

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
in correct me if i'm wrong but this
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't this doesn't
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
prohibit us from
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
from doing that if we wanted to enter
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
into a reciprocating agree if
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
massachusetts rejected this in its
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
entirety and just we're not doing it
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
this we wouldn't be prohibited from
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
entering into a reciprocating agreement
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
with the state of massachusetts
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
we would not there's nothing in here
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
that says we can't play with other
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
people in the sandbox once we enter this
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
one so
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not sure there was something we
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
were reciprocating
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
um the oplc issued licenses to those who
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
were licensed in other states
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
no matter what their home state was
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
doing to us
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
but by entering into the compact right
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't i don't see that in the
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
testimony no compact has been discussed
 
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.829 align:start position:0%
testimony no compact has been discussed
here

00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:38:07.839 --> 00:38:08.710 align:start position:0%
here
um

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
lindsey courtney's testimony
 
00:38:11.359 --> 00:38:12.150 align:start position:0%
lindsey courtney's testimony
well

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
the opl in specific reference to 397 in
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
my notes i have that
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
oplc um
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
was on board with this
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
with this bill yes yes so i'm talking of
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
a different way which is what they did
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
during the last two years right yeah and
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to have i think we're going
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
to be duking it out over that on on
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
monday when we execute as far as so
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
you're talking about making that the
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
model rather than yeah yeah so we're in
 
00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.390 align:start position:0%
model rather than yeah yeah so we're in
charge

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
because it worked so well in 2021
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
and brought in so many psychologists and
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
family therapists and
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
mental health counselors and they're on
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
the numbers here in the testimony
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so you know an approach like that
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
it would be interesting just to hear the
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
opinions of the oplc director in
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
reference to the state of new hampshire
 
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
creating in essence its own compact
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
versus getting involved in an existing
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
one i think that that's
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
creating your own compact is going to
 
00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.470 align:start position:0%
creating your own compact is going to
require

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
that that you just still throw that down
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
on paper you're talking about you're
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
going to have to have people to manage
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
that you're going to have to have
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
what we can ask them what they did for
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
the last two years so they were quite
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
successful it seems like
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
well and
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
maybe yeah we would have to ask her if
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
if she agrees that she was quite
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
successful do you have anything today
 
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.230 align:start position:0%
successful do you have anything today
representative

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh i just want to say it i recall
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
hearing uh during testimony that the
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
statement was made that basically
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
massachusetts does not join compacts
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
and they are obviously the
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
how shall i say money state of northern
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
new england
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
i think they feel like they can call
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
their own shots
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that new hampshire has that
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
much i'll point out that they did
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
introduce the physician licensing
 
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
compact in march so that may change
 
00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.069 align:start position:0%
compact in march so that may change
oh

00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
yeah in in i mean it's not a big secret
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
right folks in new hampshire that need
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
to see
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
higher level some higher level medical
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
care and specialty work go to boston
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's not a secret boston is a
 
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
substantial worldwide hub for medicine
 
00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.510 align:start position:0%
substantial worldwide hub for medicine
and

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
you know we discussed that
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
in the the other hearing about
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
you know cross-border
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
i mean my stepmother's a physician on a
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
border town in new hampshire
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
you know she she has privileges in both
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
states because the a lot of her
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
folks in her practice go to the hail in
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
hospital in haverhill so
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
i mean there are some things in place
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
right now but that's more she's a
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
physician she's not a mental health
 
00:40:47.599 --> 00:40:49.589 align:start position:0%
physician she's not a mental health
practitioner

00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
oh yeah just addressing the issue i i
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
think if a
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
lplc was able to
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
really have a good program and be very
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
nimble and responsive is one thing but i
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
think the hearings as they you may
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
recall is that was one of the real
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
hang-ups they can't be unless you have
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know 10 more ftes and the reason we
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
can't get people to participate
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
across borders and get a secondary
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
license is it takes forever right
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
to do that uh and as a consequence we
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
lose that nimbleness especially when uh
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
well and also reimbursement issues come
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
into play too for sure right that's
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
another issue but so i think as a
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
committee we i we're obviously gonna
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
when we
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
when we get into executive session we're
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
gonna we're gonna be duking it out over
 
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.349 align:start position:0%
gonna we're gonna be duking it out over
over

00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
both both concepts and i think that
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
at least in my mind having oplc in the
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire start getting
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
into the compact creation business
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
is is beyond
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
the intention i think of what we were
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
trying to do we were trying to shrink
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
shrink government by creating the oplc i
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
don't see it as a compact model i see
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
i think michael is proposing
 
00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.030 align:start position:0%
i think michael is proposing
um

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
just licensing people from out of state
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
what's more nimble than that
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
you got a license in your state you can
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
practice in our state yeah i mean if
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
you're talking about full like
 
00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.950 align:start position:0%
you're talking about full like
reciprocation

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
reciprocation
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what they did in the last two
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
years yeah for the last two years yeah
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
just yep
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
just making it permanent yeah i think
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's a discussion that we'll have to
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh that we'll have to have with the full
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
committee certainly
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
and that would i think that's going to
 
00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
require we invite
 
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
little plc back here to
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
talk to them about what that
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
the what that would realistically look
 
00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.270 align:start position:0%
the what that would realistically look
like

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
because i i don't know exactly what that
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
would realistically look like but they
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
would be the ones that's the agency that
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
would manage it if it existed so
 
00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.510 align:start position:0%
would manage it if it existed so
um

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
and they've already done so
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
yeah they would know exactly what we're
 
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
talking about they would know exactly so
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
that i mean
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a that's a significant
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
certainly a paul of a legitimate policy
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
other than that i think that you know
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of where we are with
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
this type with this type of bill you
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
know we're not
 
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
unlike other bills you know we're not
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
getting until you know page 15 and
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
trying to strike out a line or anything
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
this is just the recipe for the brownies
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
that we're either going to eat or not
 
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:17.990 align:start position:0%
that we're either going to eat or not
eat

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
eat
 
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.109 align:start position:0%
eat
and

00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:19.119 --> 00:43:20.150 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
and i guess you know we'll
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
we'll duke it out so
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
as far as the technical aspects of a
 
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.349 align:start position:0%
as far as the technical aspects of a
subcommittee

00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:43:27.359 --> 00:43:29.750 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
um

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
i mean subcommittees technically
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
can make recommendations i i would think
 
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.190 align:start position:0%
can make recommendations i i would think
that

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
the recommendation at this point would
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
be to discuss the the really the two
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
the two options
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
the two models at at the full committee
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily decide whether you
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
know the subcommittee is going to vote
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
yes or no on this particular piece of
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
legislation because i think that
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
if we're gonna if we're gonna come up
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
with two concepts
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
then we need to discuss them both at
 
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
we're gonna continue to remain an island
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a problem we can't
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
continue to remain an island agreed i i
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
just like to say you know i'm really
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
sorry that i'm
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
being a stick in the mud on this
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
but here's the truth of the matter
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room knows that no
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
rules committee is going to modify
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
that item
 
00:44:25.839 --> 00:44:28.390 align:start position:0%
that item
uh

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's a political
 
00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.510 align:start position:0%
it's it's a political
pill

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
pill
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
that's embedded in there
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
and no rules committee is going to
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
change that a rules committee rightfully
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
will change rules that actually make the
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
compact work better technically and
 
00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.230 align:start position:0%
compact work better technically and
medically

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
medically
 
00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.030 align:start position:0%
medically
um

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
so if this were an issue of of a
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
technical issue
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even arisen have arisen in my
 
00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.510 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even arisen have arisen in my
mind

00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
because i know it can be fixed
 
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:01.750 align:start position:0%
because i know it can be fixed
uh

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
i still remain unconvinced about the
 
00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
relative value of
 
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
telemedicine for
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
psychological counseling
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
i too have a little bit of experience
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
in medical research
 
00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
interpreting it reviewing it analyzing
 
00:45:18.319 --> 00:45:19.750 align:start position:0%
interpreting it reviewing it analyzing
it

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm underwhelmed
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
by what i've seen over the past 35 years
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm also quite cognizant
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
that if you ask a
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
a podiatrist
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
if uh
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know everybody should see a
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
podiatrist every 48 hours
 
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
well they'd say yes
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
okay and there's research to support it
 
00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.190 align:start position:0%
okay and there's research to support it
so

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.309 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
with all due respect i'm not convinced
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:45:49.359 --> 00:45:50.710 align:start position:0%
that um
telemedicine

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
telemedicine
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
for for this kind of thing is
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
is um the best choice
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
and number two i just know
 
00:45:59.910 --> 00:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
that this political pill will not be
 
00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.150 align:start position:0%
that this political pill will not be
corrected

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
corrected
 
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.030 align:start position:0%
corrected
and

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh thanks to
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
rep yakubovich here
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
he's given us
 
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.470 align:start position:0%
he's given us
another

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
i think very good model to consider
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
so we can still fix the problem
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
be happy to hear any other you know
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
i i i think i
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
i tried to understand what your point of
 
00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:33.829 align:start position:0%
i tried to understand what your point of
view

00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
view
 
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh but i think it's it's uh as just to
 
00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:37.990 align:start position:0%
uh but i think it's it's uh as just to
reiterate

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
reiterate
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
i think it's there such that as as the
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
ama wants physicians to be aware of
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
cultural differences and i think that is
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
crucially important
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
and i think it was met with that intent
 
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.950 align:start position:0%
and i think it was met with that intent
i

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
again maybe i'm giving credit where
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
credit is due perhaps i'm not sure
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
i wasn't there at the promulgation of it
 
00:46:57.359 --> 00:46:58.870 align:start position:0%
i wasn't there at the promulgation of it
but

00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
i would say that
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
erroring on the side of
 
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.230 align:start position:0%
erroring on the side of
whatever

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
that the intent was not
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
a political statement
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
by having that included and i think it
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
was included and
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh it would be included in anything that
 
00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:15.910 align:start position:0%
uh it would be included in anything that
uh

00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
as a physician
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh i would i would actually expect it to
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
be included
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
and if it were not i would be very
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
surprised and dismayed
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
if it were not included because as our
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
society becomes more diverse
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
we need to be responsive and
 
00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:33.910 align:start position:0%
we need to be responsive and
appreciative

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
appreciative
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
of those differences
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
and if we can do that it gives us better
 
00:47:37.599 --> 00:47:38.790 align:start position:0%
and if we can do that it gives us better
understanding

00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
for people that have a different
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
background and have and sometimes
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
those backgrounds have created part of
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
the problem that brings them to our
 
00:47:47.359 --> 00:47:48.630 align:start position:0%
the problem that brings them to our
attention

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
and that's part of that understanding
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
so in that sense um again
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
i will admit uh there could be wrong but
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
i don't think the intent at all was
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
political i can see where if one were to
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
choose could make that interpretation
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
but my interpretation it again comes
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
from having served with the ama and
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
knowing what we're required to do
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
and the understanding we're supposed to
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
bring to the table when we see a patient
 
00:48:16.079 --> 00:48:16.790 align:start position:0%
bring to the table when we see a patient
and

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
understand that patient in all their
 
00:48:18.319 --> 00:48:21.349 align:start position:0%
understand that patient in all their
dimensions

00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you guys for
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
coming here gorgeous day
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
last place any of us want to be i
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
believe me i uh
 
00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:30.790 align:start position:0%
believe me i uh
so

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
um okay you know i think that that's
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
i think that's i unless some unless
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
somebody really wants to to do some sort
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
of a formal recommendation i think that
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
the reality here is that the
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
um we we kind of have two we have two
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
models on how to handle this and i think
 
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
that we're just going to have to discuss
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
that as a full committee
 
00:48:53.839 --> 00:48:55.510 align:start position:0%
that as a full committee
um

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
as to what
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
we're not choosing between two pieces of
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
legislation let's not forget that right
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
we don't have an alternative piece of
 
00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.349 align:start position:0%
we don't have an alternative piece of
legislation

00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
you know whether we're going internal or
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
compact so let's just let's just
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
understand that we'll just if if 397 is
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
rejected by this committee
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
then let's just make sure that the
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
reasoning for that is well spelled out
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
so can it be handled in a
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
in theory bulk of this you could do that
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
you're talking
 
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
it would be germaine because you're
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
you're talking about just a structural
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
difference between that the topic is
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
still the same so i can i can see that
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
being germaine um but
 
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.510 align:start position:0%
being germaine um but
typically

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
typically the folks that are going to
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
want to weigh in on this the folks that
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
have to actually deliver that are going
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
to want more time i mean we're not
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
really thrilled about the deadlines the
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
senate's given us on some of these
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation to have the
 
00:50:01.589 --> 00:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
director of oplc come in here and give a
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
go no go on on an amendment that
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
modifies that office
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
without a bit of a deep dive is not
