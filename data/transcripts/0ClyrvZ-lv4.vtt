yo for bringing this bill um I I won't
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
take long with my testimony I know that
 
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot about it already um
 
00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
this is something that I do as a as a
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
hobby I just do it for fun uh I've been
 
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
doing it for about seven years now and
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh the reason I do it is that really
 
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
nobody else was doing it nobody else was
 
00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
advocating for the idea that we should
 
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
stop changing the clocks twice a year
 
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
and and the more I looked into it the
 
00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
more I realized how deadly the changing
 
00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
of the clocks is like whether or not you
 
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
like one time or another time uh the
 
00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:24.759 align:start position:0%
actual change of the clocks in the
 
00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 align:start position:0%
spring is really deadly um traff traffic
 
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
accidents go up heart attacks Strokes
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
workplace accidents workplace
 
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
productivity goes down lots of reasons
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh verified by lots of science over lots
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
of different um uh uh areas that make it
 
00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
clear that it's a bad idea to be
 
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
changing the clocks um the uh solution
 
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
that you have before you uh I advocate
 
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
for I understand that there's some
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
opposition to it because there's always
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
a question and this happens in every
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
state I think this is maybe the 11th or
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
12th state I've testified in um and
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
there's always questions that come up
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
about what happens with our neighbors uh
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
especially for broadcasters uh how do we
 
00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
end you know we don't want to have more
 
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
confusion and that's a legitimate issue
 
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
it's why we operate under What's called
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
the uniform time act of 1966 because the
 
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
federal government wanted to make sure
 
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
that individual jurisdictions weren't
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
changing the time every uh you know
 
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
every year or so because there were a
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
couple of dozen states a year between
 
00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
World War II and 1966 that would change
 
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
their time and so now that doesn't
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
happen anymore under the uniform time
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
act uh the problem is that they didn't
 
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
make it so that a state could freeze
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
into permanent daylight time the way
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
that they can in permanent Standard Time
 
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
the way that Arizona Hawaii and Puerto
 
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
Rico do so this is a solution that uh
 
00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:41.479 align:start position:0%
addresses that it's a it's a good
 
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
Regional solution it's not going to go
 
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
unless Massachusetts goes and the
 
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
reality is massachusett isn't going to
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
go unless Connecticut goes and then the
 
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
harder nut to crack is that Connecticut
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
isn't going to go unless New York goes
 
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
so New York for the first time this year
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
has a bill before their legislature uh I
 
00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
would say that overall and then I'm
 
00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:00.759 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions I'll end on
 
00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
overall the actual language of this bill
 
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually matter all that much uh
 
00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:09.639 align:start position:0%
because it's going to need Federal
 
00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
authorization we need the feds to get
 
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
involved and uh when I started this
 
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
there was absolutely no federal interest
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
uh last year there were three bills that
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
went and I talked to the offices of all
 
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
of the sponsors of all those three bills
 
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
and all of them said that the number one
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
way that they could get co-sponsors for
 
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
their bill was to go to the states that
 
00:08:30.749 --> 00:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
had passed something we have 15 states
 
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
now that have passed some kind of
 
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
legislation saying that they want to
 
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
lock the clock in Mo and all of them
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
have the intention of locking into
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
permanent daylight time uh so they would
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
the sponsors for those Federal bills
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
would go to the senators or the
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
representatives from the state that one
 
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
of those 15 states that had passed a
 
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:49.720 align:start position:0%
bill and there are states all over the
 
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
country from Washington to Florida
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
everywhere in between they would go to
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
those States and they would the
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
representatives or senators from those
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
States and say would you be a coast
 
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor of our bill uh you know that
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
this is something the people of your
 
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
state want as expressed by the state
 
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
legislature so uh I would uh uh
 
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
recommend uh humbly that don't get too
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
wrapped up in the particular details of
 
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
what's in this bill passing it is a
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
great way to signal that yes we here in
 
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
the Granite State uh are believers that
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
we should fix that we should lock the
 
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
clock and stop the the barbarism of
 
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
changing the clock twice a year
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh and with that I'm happy to answer any
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you again for
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify remotely I really
 
00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you very much
 
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
represent black us um thank you for
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you madam chair
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
so you said that uh this would require
 
00:09:48.069 --> 00:09:48.079 align:start position:0%
congressional action my understanding
 
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
from previous testimony was that if we
 
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to stay in the Eastern Time Zone
 
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
but stay on daylight savings time that
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
that would be the case but if we wanted
 
00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
to move to Atlantic time zone that would
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
not be required you know for a fact
 
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
which which way it is uh yeah it's just
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
it thank you for your question and thank
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
you madam chair uh the it's slightly
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
different from that if I understand your
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
question right and I'm and I'm sorry if
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
I didn't get it quite right uh it's it's
 
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
legal now for a state to move to
 
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:23.240 align:start position:0%
permanent Standard time so you could
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
lock the clock now into the time zone
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
that you are in now uh that's what
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
Arizona Hawaii and Puerto Rico did
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
um if you um uh wanted to move into
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
Atlantic time that is the theory behind
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
this bill and it's a novel Theory and I
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
support it I have asked the Department
 
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
of Transportation in Washington very
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
specifically about this they have a they
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
have a lawyer that works you know on
 
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
this issue she it's not all she does she
 
00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
does other things but this is a specific
 
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
thing that she works on and I said is
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
this Theory correct if uh New Hampshire
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
passed a law that said they want to move
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
into Atlantic time and then say on
 
00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:01.639 align:start position:0%
Atlantic Standard Time year round would
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
that be legal under uh the Department of
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
Transportation rules under the uniform
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
time act and her response was typical
 
00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
for a DC uh uh employee which was well I
 
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
can't answer a hypothetical uh I'd have
 
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
to see the bill when it comes so uh you
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
know I encourage I I I like the novel
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
approach and I I encourage any progress
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
on doing what we can to lock the clock
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's unclear there there's no clear
 
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
answer to the question of if it would
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
actually be legal to move into Atlantic
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
time as one state and go into Standard
 
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
Time uh it I I would love to see it
 
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:37.240 align:start position:0%
tested I would love to see that
 
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
hypothetical proved out but at this
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
point it's uh not not specifically clear
 
00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
committee I I have a question Madam
 
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
chair yes representative
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
sh thank you madam chair so Mr Yates uh
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
the question I have is do you have an
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
opinion on which time zone is the best
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
for us to be in I I take your other
 
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
arguments at face value uh but the
 
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:07.870 align:start position:0%
arguments at face value uh but the
question

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
is the East this this Zone that we're in
 
00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
currently is very long it goes all the
 
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
way to uh the western edge of Indiana I
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
believe um and uh and
 
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
and the the actual relationship of the
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
time uh to the Sun uh where we are um is
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
the question I have so can you opine on
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
that or is that not the area of your
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
expertise uh thank you very much for
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
your question and thank you madam chair
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh the New Yorker did a story about this
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
effort a few years back and they used
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
the word agnostic they said Scott Yates
 
00:12:50.189 --> 00:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
is agnostic on this question uh and and
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
that's where I am I I don't have a
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
particular opinion I I do think that
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
each state should make an opinion and uh
 
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
and when I bring up the fact that you
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
brought up just now that maybe we should
 
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
look at the geography a little bit when
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
making this decision and not make a
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
blanket decision for every state in the
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
country without respect to where they
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
are in the time zone I think that that
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
is um not not the most helpful it it
 
00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
makes it more complicated and sometimes
 
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
people shy away from complexity but
 
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
you're exactly right I've written on my
 
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
blog a couple of times about the fact
 
00:13:21.189 --> 00:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
that you know Boston is about a thousand
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
miles away from Indianapolis it's crazy
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
that they are both in the same time zone
 
00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959 align:start position:0%
uh uh especially when you look at the
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
fact that Indiana because of some
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
peculiarities of Indiana has a couple of
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
sections of the state that are carved
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
out that are actually in the central
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
time zone so one of the things that
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
could happen if there was Federal
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
legislation saying that we should lock
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
the clock is that Indiana could
 
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
potentially unify and go onto what is
 
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
currently uh Standard time for them they
 
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
would then the whole state would be
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
unified and they would be in the same
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
time zone as Chicago which is more their
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
natural area of Interest my view is
 
00:13:55.949 --> 00:13:55.959 align:start position:0%
that's up to the people of Indiana for
 
00:13:58.269 --> 00:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think that uh it's
 
00:13:59.710 --> 00:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
perfectly appropriate for you to
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
actually be in Atlantic time Atlantic
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
Standard Time in a sense because you are
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
you know along with a lot of New England
 
00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:10.839 align:start position:0%
jutted out into the Atlantic and you are
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
uh geographically positioned east of New
 
00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:16.839 align:start position:0%
York City which is sort of the center of
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
not really it's still on the Eastern
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
edge of the Eastern time zone so it
 
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
would make
 
00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:23.959 align:start position:0%
uh I think
 
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:25.959 align:start position:0%
geographically uh for the State of New
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it would probably make the
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
most sense to be in uh what is now
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
permanent what would what would be
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
called permanent daylight time uh but
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
but I leave that question up to you I've
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
got a lot of resources on my blog uh
 
00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:40.839 align:start position:0%
that can help you sort of look at what
 
00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:42.519 align:start position:0%
uh what the science is on which time
 
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
zone that you would want to be in but um
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh I I think the the and I would say
 
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
just one more thing to answer your
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
question very briefly which is the trend
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
of the states all all of those 15 states
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
that have passed something and nearly
 
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
all of the states that have uh uh
 
00:15:02.749 --> 00:15:02.759 align:start position:0%
something proposed for this year uh have
 
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
proposed moving into daylight time there
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
hasn't been a state yet that has taken
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
any action to move into Standard Time so
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh and that I think is an expression of
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
the constituents of the lawmakers that
 
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
have brought this forward which is they
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
want to see uh their constituents all
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
want to see permanent daylight time
 
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
thank you again for your
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:36.670 align:start position:0%
 
representa

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
representa has a question thank you m
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
Madam chair um Mr Yates you have um
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
there's a long list of states that have
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
passed something although they're you
 
00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
know different and you've been working
 
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
on this for seven years and I know it's
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
been going on longer than that so in all
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
occurred uh thank you for your question
 
00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you madam chair uh no I I I
 
00:16:11.949 --> 00:16:11.959 align:start position:0%
mean this is one of those funny things
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
about momentum um you know when I first
 
00:16:16.269 --> 00:16:16.279 align:start position:0%
started this seven years ago there was a
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
lot of there was talk about it and
 
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
people complained about it but uh there
 
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't any state that had actually
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
passed anything there were there were
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 states that even had a proposed
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
Bill uh uh this year we have
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh well we have 15 states that have
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
passed something so they don't
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily have another bill this year
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
so now we have actually fewer States
 
00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:37.959 align:start position:0%
considering it than we had last year uh
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
because 15 states have passed something
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
but 15 states having passed something uh
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
three Federal bills with lots of uh uh
 
00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
uh co-sponsors from both sides of the
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
aisle like this is one of those things
 
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
where uh nothing has actually happen
 
00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:54.759 align:start position:0%
because the answer is a little bit
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
complicated but uh the momentum toward
 
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
change is clearly there and uh I my
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
impression I testified I guess two weeks
 
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
ago now in Nebraska where I had
 
00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
testified four years previous and when I
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
was there four years ago it w the
 
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
general feeling was we don't want to be
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
the first state of the union to pass
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
something and uh the impression I got
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
when I was there last time was well we
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to be the last state in the
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
country to pass something so I think the
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
momentum is clearly there but you're
 
00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:26.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely right there's uh as of today
 
00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
there haven't been any changes to time
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
zones uh since the energy Act of 2006
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
question there
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
questions right seeing none thank you
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
very much Mr Gates thank you thank you
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
for having me uh Scott
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
spaling good morning Madam chair for the
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
record my name is Scott spradling I am a
 
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
representative and lobbyist government
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
Affairs person for the New Hampshire
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
Association of broadcasters and uh we
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
are here to testify in opposition to
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
this specific bill uh I'd like to sort
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
of just run through a couple of the
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
basic reasons uh why we appear before
 
00:18:05.549 --> 00:18:05.559 align:start position:0%
you this morning I think first and
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
foremost from the broadcasters which is
 
00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
radio and TV in New Hampshire it's
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
important for you to know that we
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
represent more than 96 different
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
stations throughout our small state many
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
of those stations are part of a network
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
that broadcasts and shares content
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
across state lines so while we're having
 
00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
a conversation about geography from our
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
perspective um because the foundation of
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
r entire industry is based on the clock
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
and on time this is more than a
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
geographic conversation for us and
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
that's why we have concerns if I could
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
just take one quick step back Madam
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
chair and and and suggest that you sort
 
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
of take a look at the history of this
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
conversation over a number of years that
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
it's uh been a a little different almost
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
every time we've had a conversation
 
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
about dumping daylight savings entering
 
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
the Atlantic time zone and jumping ahead
 
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
jumping ahead without daylight savings
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
jumping ahead with daylight savings
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
jumping with a coalition of States uh
 
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
the Coalition changes so every few years
 
00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:02.919 align:start position:0%
or so the conversation itself has
 
00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
seemingly shifted in its details and
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
from a broadcaster's perspective where
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
even the move of one hour could make a
 
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
tremendous difference it's concerning to
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
us um we believe right out of the gate
 
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
it's important for you to understand
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
from our association's perspective we
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
don't dispute the merits of this
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
conversation what Scott mentioned before
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
what the prime sponsor has talked about
 
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of the benefits uh what
 
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz who's a
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor um we we understand that
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
conversation um what we are simply
 
00:19:34.149 --> 00:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
saying is that a state-by-state approach
 
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
is a very dangerous one for our industry
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
and we would urge you to try to find a
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
way to have this conversation at the
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
federal level and not try to do this
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
peac meal I had a lengthy conversation
 
00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:45.559 align:start position:0%
with the prime sponsor with
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative yella who's impassionate
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
about the idea and it was asking me to
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
go back to our various State
 
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
associations to try to figure out if
 
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
there's a Tipping Point like what Scott
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
just talked about building momentum are
 
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
there 10 states in a coalition 15 and
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
what I found was that um like he almost
 
00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:08.799 align:start position:0%
explained uh in his testimony whereas
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is connected to Maine and
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Massachusetts is connected
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
to Connecticut which is connected to uh
 
00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
New York you almost start doing the you
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
know Them Bones song where everything's
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
connected to everything and that's kind
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
of our point the broadcasters don't want
 
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:25.240 align:start position:0%
to do a coalition they absolutely
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
believe it needs to be done at a federal
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
level and there's a very strong economic
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
reason why so this bill would
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
essentially create for the continental
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
US a fifth time zone and in listening to
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
the testimony I understand the
 
00:20:40.029 --> 00:20:40.039 align:start position:0%
geographic side of things and I think my
 
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
clients absolutely would as well but it
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
creates some big challenges New
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
England's a relatively small cluster of
 
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
states in both space and population so
 
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
if we move it ignores the way that the
 
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:53.799 align:start position:0%
broadcast system is set up we broadcast
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
based on a hub so if you think about
 
00:20:59.070 --> 00:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
radio and TV programming our our net of
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
programs that we share with you is a
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
combination of locally produced programs
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
and nationally syndicated programs those
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
syndicated programs are sent out by
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
clock so as all of you know we have
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
Prime Time viewing for television right
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
we've all heard that before the most
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
expensive advertisements are usually
 
00:21:22.269 --> 00:21:22.279 align:start position:0%
between 8 and 11: p.m the best evening
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
shows are during that window and that's
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
because that is the greatest probability
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
of the most eyes on that program the
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
more R you have the more expensive it is
 
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
for Revenue because the greater your
 
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
overall reach when you make that
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
adjustment by even one hour it does a
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
couple of different things it will throw
 
00:21:42.909 --> 00:21:42.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the other states into
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
the Atlantic time zone which would be an
 
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
hour ahead so that as we are having this
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
conversation at uh 10:25 is it would
 
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
actually be 11:25 in the morning right
 
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
now our prime time would be different
 
00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
from our New York hub which is in charge
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
of sending out all of this information
 
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
so the 8:00 TV show that you love would
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
now run at 9 the live sports that you
 
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
enjoy watching would now run an hour
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
later and the struggle for connecting
 
00:22:13.269 --> 00:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
revenues and eyes for the states that
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
are in the Eastern I'm sorry in the
 
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
Atlantic time zone would uh have a
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
massive impact on revenues because those
 
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
are our main revenue streams um I talked
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
to a few of our uh various clients to
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
try to get some kind of an idea of what
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
this means so for example um local news
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
would run an hour later Monday Night
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
Football instead of starting kickoff if
 
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
you're a Patriots fan your kickoff is
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
not at 8:30 it's now at 9:30 which means
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
the game goes until about 1:00 a.m.
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
you've all probably collectively
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
struggled to watch Red Sox starting a
 
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
game first pitch at 10:07 on the west
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
coast when they're playing LA Angels um
 
00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:54.919 align:start position:0%
that is sort of what the commonplace
 
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
time frame would be for um East Coast
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
games if we make this kind of a shift
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
for public TV uh the general manager
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
shared with me that because so much is
 
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799 align:start position:0%
syndicated if local viewers with public
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
television here can find on their cable
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
channels the other public TV stations
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
which right now are side by side they
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
would be able to change the channel and
 
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
essentially not be watching New
 
00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public television which not
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
only misaligns the key syndicated
 
00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:25.240 align:start position:0%
programs they do but it knocks viewers
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
off of the local programming that they
 
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
do as as well um uh Peter Frid is the GM
 
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
over there he said this would be just
 
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
the one hour would be a cataclysmic
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
shift for their ability to raise funds
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
which is often viewer supported in radio
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
to the western side of the state we have
 
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
stations that broadcast in both New
 
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Vermont simultaneously and
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
the question I got from one GM Matt
 
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
Housman who runs a number of stations
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
along the Vermont border he said how do
 
00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
I schedule my morning show which is live
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
broadcast locally and then mix in the
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
syndicated program which would start at
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
a completely different time than Vermont
 
00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:03.559 align:start position:0%
that would be a nightmare we would lose
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of Revenue we would lose listeners
 
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure how we do it you also
 
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
run a file of am broadcast signal rules
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't want to get too
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
deep into the Technologies because quite
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
frankly I don't know it that well myself
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is the federal
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
government requires AM stations to power
 
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
up and power down based on what time it
 
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
is and the reason why is because am
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
radio waves travel farther than FM radio
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
waves and if you stay powered up at the
 
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
wrong time you're going to interfere
 
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
with other AM stations that are
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
broadcasting similarly on the dial and
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
if you jam if you uh drop down then
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
listeners who are anticipating heing
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
your local broadcasting can't hear it
 
00:24:48.029 --> 00:24:48.039 align:start position:0%
just a one-h hour difference in shifting
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
between the nighttime and and and um and
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
morning hours would again make a huge
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
difference so to do this peace meal is a
 
00:24:59.710 --> 00:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
uh a frighten ing concept for the
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
broadcasters and and Madam chair let me
 
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
just close with a couple of thoughts um
 
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
I I wish representative y um um uh yella
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
was here I don't know if you recall but
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
when we were opening the testimony last
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
week you asked him so what time would it
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
be right now um if you uh if we were
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
having this conversation and he
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
mistakenly said well it would be 9:20
 
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
when instead it would be 11:20 I only
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
rais that this is this is not to
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
criticize him at all I only rais that
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
because one of the points that was made
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
in supporting this is we're going to
 
00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:35.559 align:start position:0%
eliminate a lot of confusion actually no
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
we're not uh not only are we not going
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
to eliminate confusion but if you don't
 
00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
do this from a federal perspective let's
 
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
say the bill passes hypothetically in
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
Maine and Massachusetts do it too and
 
00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:48.039 align:start position:0%
we're the three states that Bolt the
 
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
other states around us not only will
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
have different times but they're also
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
recognizing daylight savings so for four
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
months out of the year were different 8
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
months were the same
 
00:26:01.389 --> 00:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
that's not a a resolution to uh the
 
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
confusion of our current situation at
 
00:26:05.549 --> 00:26:05.559 align:start position:0%
least all of us are in this together on
 
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
the Eastern seab board the second point
 
00:26:09.389 --> 00:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
and and I I respectfully share this
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
because a lot of what representative
 
00:26:13.389 --> 00:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
Schultz said in her testimony and
 
00:26:15.389 --> 00:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
support of her bill makes a lot of sense
 
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
to me and I think our broadcasting uh
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
friends and partners would agree with it
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
but um she pointed out that uh from her
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
youth experience and living sort of near
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
the the timeline it wasn't that big a
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
deal there weren't that many um uh you
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
know changes or challenges um but I
 
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
would respectfully submit that look at
 
00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
the history of why we have these time
 
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
zones representative Horgan accurately
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
pointed out that it started because of
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
the railroads in
 
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
1883 that's almost a decade before radio
 
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
was even invented forget becoming
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
commercialized we came well after these
 
00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
time zones everything came after these
 
00:26:55.389 --> 00:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
time zones so for us our industrial
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
analogy to this is you want to rehab the
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
house but you're going to rip the
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
foundation out and then try to keep the
 
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
house intact for us economically this is
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily damaging and that's why
 
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
we oppose the bill and from from there I
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
would uh be happy to take any
 
00:27:14.389 --> 00:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Shu
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
was the
 
00:27:18.909 --> 00:27:18.919 align:start position:0%
first thank you madam chair good morning
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
Scott good morning good to see you nice
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
to see
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
you um I was listening to your testimony
 
00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:28.269 align:start position:0%
you um I was listening to your testimony
and

00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
just want to see if I understood
 
00:27:33.789 --> 00:27:33.799 align:start position:0%
correctly you're basically saying that
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
because uh the states that jut into the
 
00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:40.519 align:start position:0%
Atlantic Maine and New Hampshire are a
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
smaller market for these programs that
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
would put us at a disadvantage both
 
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:50.799 align:start position:0%
economically and trying to negotiate for
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps getting programs sent to us in
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
what we would consider prime time did I
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
get that right yes yes ma'am um so let
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
me we'll sort of explore it this way so
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
um if you watch uh so mu right ABC the
 
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
local station so syndicated programming
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
Ellen degenerous runs at 4:00 um like I
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
said with the prime time the shows that
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
run at 8 and 9 and 10 o'clock before the
 
00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:18.519 align:start position:0%
11 o'clock local mu news kicks in on the
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
ABC channel those would all have to be
 
00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:25.519 align:start position:0%
given to us earlier for our Atlantic
 
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
time zone to be accommodated meaning
 
00:28:30.029 --> 00:28:30.039 align:start position:0%
they would have to send a different
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
syndicated feed to our states and allow
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
us to run it an hour ahead of the
 
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
Eastern Time Zone and my GM from wur
 
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
Jeffrey Bartlett has said that's not
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
going to happen they won't do that for
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
three states even with Boston being in
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
that market it's not enough people in
 
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
the population to essentially create
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
this time zone for three states it would
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
have to be done at a federal level with
 
00:28:57.389 --> 00:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
a much larger conversation of how this
 
00:28:59.470 --> 00:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
Network looks like the other practical
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
aspect to this when I talked about the
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
uh the the how we're all connected to
 
00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:06.519 align:start position:0%
this so Connecticut with New York we
 
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
connected with the Pennsylvania
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
Association of broadcasters and they
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
said they would never leave without New
 
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
York and they would uh the Philadelphia
 
00:29:19.149 --> 00:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
and New York City are so close together
 
00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.559 align:start position:0%
and their broadcast schedules overlap
 
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
that's a problem now you're bringing
 
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania into the conversation and
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
now Washington DC becomes a component of
 
00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
the conversation because of how the
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
broadcast markets overlap so it is it's
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
kind of like dominoes with superglue the
 
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
way that the broadcast network ends up
 
00:29:42.909 --> 00:29:42.919 align:start position:0%
working and so for three um oh I'm going
 
00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
to use a terrible word three Rebel
 
00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:46.519 align:start position:0%
states to jump out I love our live free
 
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
and die State and and our broadcasters
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
do too but from an economic and revenue
 
00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:54.039 align:start position:0%
perspective you'd be chasing eyes to
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
other Market broadcasts and with the
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
invention and Advent of of things like
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
Hulu and other things our viewers could
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
stay in the Eastern Time Zone even as
 
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
we're in Atlantic and that would be a
 
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
crushing blow to the revenue streams for
 
00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.710 align:start position:0%
crushing blow to the revenue streams for
our

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
broadcasters thank you very much sure
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam chair Mr uh
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
spradling um longtime listener first
 
00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:23.799 align:start position:0%
time caller here
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to ask you a rhetorical
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
question they do Broadcasting Canada
 
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
right they do yes they do okay Canada
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
has more time zones than the United
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
States does already that's right in
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
Canada they have found a way to handle
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
this yeah okay so so I I this I don't
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
see this as something where you guys are
 
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:45.559 align:start position:0%
going to have to reinvent the wheel here
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
when the Canadians are already in
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
essence doing that now you brought up an
 
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
interesting ORD Hulu but you know I was
 
00:30:56.629 --> 00:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
thinking about a a specific program to
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
use as an example here and I know you're
 
00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
not going to like to hear this but I
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
would be I have no clue what network any
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
of them are on because I watch them all
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
in a DVR I don't watch anything live
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
frankly because I one I don't have the
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
time and two I'm not gonna sit through
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
commercials if I don't have to and I
 
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
know that you know that's your at your
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
bread and butter but that's reality okay
 
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
I I couldn't even tell you what day some
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
of my shows are on they just show up on
 
00:31:21.389 --> 00:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
the DVR and here we go so I think the
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
way that television works now has
 
00:31:26.509 --> 00:31:26.519 align:start position:0%
certainly changed Beyond just the aspect
 
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
of a time zone and a market because we
 
00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:32.519 align:start position:0%
have the ability to to I decide what my
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
time frame is I decide what my timeline
 
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
is and I decide when and how I I choose
 
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
to watch things and you know I I do it
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
through a satellite service that has
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
told me that they have the ability to
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
track what I
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
record case in point with our little our
 
00:31:51.389 --> 00:31:51.399 align:start position:0%
little slip in the Super Bowl years ago
 
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
it was the most rewound thing on a DVR
 
00:31:56.509 --> 00:31:56.519 align:start position:0%
in US history so that we know that they
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
can track that sort of thing so
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
certainly your your base of
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
Revenue off of viewed items can has a
 
00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
correlation to that because it's
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
trackable so so I guess my question for
 
00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:12.039 align:start position:0%
you overall here is you know we already
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
have a state Arizona that doesn't
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily jive with everybody else and
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
that's you guys are finding a way to
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
handle that as well why why would the
 
00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
Hub of New England coming off in the
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
various states that would be tied to to
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
the Boston Market really truly be so
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
devastating when you in fact have two
 
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
Canadian time zones that you have to
 
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
deal with in correlation so I'm trying
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
to I'm trying to buy argument here man
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm having a hard time okay I
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
understand um the the Canadian time
 
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
zones also predate all of us so I think
 
00:32:48.629 --> 00:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
the argument about time zones actually
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
stands from um from our purposes um
 
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
geography also matters because New
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
England is a reasonably relatively small
 
00:32:57.789 --> 00:32:57.799 align:start position:0%
geography compared to to the broader
 
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
expanse of Western States I think the
 
00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:01.799 align:start position:0%
conversation that we're having here it
 
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not so far apart on
 
00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
reasons why why you would have this
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
again our clients my clients our
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
broadcasters don't dispute the merits of
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
having this conversation and we
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
recognize exactly what you're talking
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
about with the geography of this our
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
entire point is that our broadcast clock
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
is connected to the entire Eastern Time
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
Zone and R rgm who is connected to HST
 
00:33:26.399 --> 00:33:27.509 align:start position:0%
Zone and R rgm who is connected to HST
broadcast

00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
broadcast
 
00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
which is the ABC Station in Boston so
 
00:33:32.669 --> 00:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
it's the same family of broadcasting
 
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
stations has connected with the folks in
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
New York City that control the network
 
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
broadcast syndicated programs and they
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
have so much as said that no it would
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
not be enough for those three states to
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
go Rogue if you will and for us to be
 
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
able to change our broadcast time clock
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
in a way that wouldn't be damaging so
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
again this is that mix of syndicated
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
broadcast and when you get it at what
 
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
time and the local broadcasting that
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
goes on around it and so to make this
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
move the indication we have and the only
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
advice that we're really giving is
 
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
please talk about this at the federal
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
level and try to do this in a broader
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
context because then that way everybody
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
is at the table at once in fact I I
 
00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:16.839 align:start position:0%
would certainly encourage the the prime
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
sponsor and the supporters of this bill
 
00:34:20.589 --> 00:34:20.599 align:start position:0%
to talk to lawmakers at the legislative
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
level at the state level in all of these
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
states and come up with one coherent
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
approach to doing something like this
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
because coherence is what we are looking
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
for that thank you thank you madam chair
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
programmingsoftware or I'm watching The
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
Big Bang Theory I'm watching whatever
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
those are in the can man you know those
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
aren't this isn't the days of Desi Ares
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
running over and I Love Lucy and doing a
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
cigarette commercial and then running
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
back and continuing the show so I I find
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
it I don't I just don't see how that
 
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
would be difficult to be sending a a
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
feed to to the New England Affiliates to
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
show a program that isn't live it's
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
already something that they're going to
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
be beaming over to everybody else at a
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
different time and clearly you're
 
00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
already handling East Coast West Coast I
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
I went to college in
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma there was a transition growing
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
up in New England and me looking at the
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
TV going ah Central Time central time
 
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
Central Time right because I was not
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
accustomed to that but I became
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
accustomed to it so if you could focus
 
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
your questions represent par thank you
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to understand that
 
00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
with the syndication part of it the
 
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
beaming of a show why why is that
 
00:35:52.119 --> 00:35:54.349 align:start position:0%
beaming of a show why why is that
specifically

00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
difficult to do when you're
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
already sending syndicated programs
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
across multiple time zones sure um
 
00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
because there's also a great deal high
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
percentage of live broadcasts that
 
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
happen and you're ignoring the dozens
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
upon dozens of of radio stations in New
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that have to balance a great
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
deal of local live broadcasting along
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
with its syndicated programming don't
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
forget too that you're also knocking out
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
at least for New Hampshire all of the
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
local programming that is done live
 
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
you're right the syndication windows are
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
preset and they are not necessarily a
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
live broadcast although the syndicated
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
time that New York shares that uh that
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
broadcast time everybody's picking it up
 
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
in that exact hour so uh you know you're
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
you're a big fan of the movie of the
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
show blind spot on uh I think it's on
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
ABC and it runs every uh Thursday from
 
00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
9: until 10: that's when New York City
 
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
will will Syndicate and broadcast the
 
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
newest um updated times so you'd be
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
watching it at 9:00 in Vermont and 10:00
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh and please don't
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
overlook the impact on that live local
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
broadcast so your six o'clock news for
 
00:37:11.309 --> 00:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
Mu would run at 7 when the six o'clock
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
news would run at six in the states that
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
have not moved to the Atlantic time zone
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
morning radio if you're a fan for
 
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
example of um uh Greg in the morning
 
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
buzz on WB and wgir that runs from 6
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
till 10: now it would be from 7 until
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
11: but you have syndicated programming
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
that is supposed to start at 10:00 a.m.
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
or other live broadcast shows that back
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
that up the talk show networks would be
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
thrown into some turmoil with this as
 
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
well um you've got someone like Jack
 
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
Heath who runs from 9 in the morning
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
until noon on live broadcasts
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
immediately following live broadcasts
 
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
and then noon goes to a syndicated
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
program on the beny radio stations it is
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
a uh very big Challenge and there is
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
potential Revenue lost when you are
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
throwing us off an hour from the rest of
 
00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:05.829 align:start position:0%
throwing us off an hour from the rest of
the

00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
region thank you thank you thanks for
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
the question uh there's plenty more
 
00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.510 align:start position:0%
the question uh there's plenty more
representative

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
Roy thank you can you hear me yes I can
 
00:38:21.309 --> 00:38:21.319 align:start position:0%
great um my question really simple is we
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
talked about if we went it would only
 
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
happen if Massachusetts went the
 
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts will only of Connecticut
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
goes and Connecticut will go of New York
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
goes so really if that dominoes to use
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
your analogy happens would that not
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
alleviate all of your problems once New
 
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
York went so um technically sure if New
 
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
York were to join with and we were in
 
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
the same broadcast time zone as New York
 
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
City was that certainly alleviates the
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
pragmatic problems at the at the
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
national broadcast level the local
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
broadcasting challenges would still
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
apply especially with radio but um I I
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
think you're representative Roy you're
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
on to something and it is exactly why
 
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
from our perspective it's why we don't
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
we simply don't oppose the spill on its
 
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
merits it's only to try to figure out
 
00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:10.839 align:start position:0%
how to do this at the federal level so
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
that Congress can figure out who what
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
and how and do it in a way that doesn't
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
do damage to our sort of broadcast
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
Nets followup thank you so just a real
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
quick followup
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
question isn't that way though that we
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
get Federal legislators to move is by
 
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
doing things like that so if we do this
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
and ours doesn't really take effect
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
practically unless New York does now
 
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
you've got the actual Geographic not
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
just the saying we're changing well that
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
would certainly be an impetus for the
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
federal legislators to take action kind
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
of like the Supreme Court doesn't act
 
00:39:52.309 --> 00:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
unless different courts are have
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
different different decisions so I just
 
00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
feel like if if no ever does it it's not
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:40:02.589 --> 00:40:02.599 align:start position:0%
happen so um super fair question
 
00:40:04.109 --> 00:40:04.119 align:start position:0%
representative and I appreciate it and I
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
think that the only way that I can I I
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
can answer it is um we're looking at
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
this from the terms of potential risk so
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
if we were to follow that argument
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
forward and we did do something like
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
that the risk to us because of this
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
shift of just one hour is um double
 
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
digit risk of revenue losses so I guess
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
I would I would suggest to you that if
 
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
there was an Al alternative way meaning
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
if there was um not to give
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative yella a a a homework
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
assignment but if he were able to cycle
 
00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
this idea to States up and down the
 
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:40.839 align:start position:0%
Eastern seab board and do it as a
 
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
resolution and an something that doesn't
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
have the teeth to it that could allow a
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
potential for this to actually become
 
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
law that we're looking at it from the
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
perspective of risk why ask this
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
industry to absorb the potential
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
Financial Risk of this thing happening
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
in this process when there's another way
 
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
to do it that doesn't have the same kind
 
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
of a risk and I think that's what we're
 
00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
looking at here in in our argument if
 
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
that makes
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
veroda I think you're still on
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
mute I'm sorry thank you that's okay I
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
think Mr Mr SP spradling and answer my
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
question it seemed that um we needed
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
some clarification on how syndicated um
 
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
radio and television um worked together
 
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
and he answered the question thank you
 
00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
so much you're welcome right thank you
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh there any other questions
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
repres thank
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
you so there's going to be a negative
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
economic impact in broadcast
 
00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
Industries U but we've also heard
 
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
testimony that there's going to be
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
economic uh gain in much in a much
 
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
broader sector so my question is is uh
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
given that there's a growing
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
constituency that uh to use the popular
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
term has cut the cable period how do we
 
00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
justify to them the interests of one or
 
00:42:16.589 --> 00:42:16.599 align:start position:0%
two industries versus the much broader
 
00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
impacts um that we'll see in in other
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
areas thank you sure it's a fair
 
00:42:23.309 --> 00:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
question and for people that are okay
 
00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:25.839 align:start position:0%
robbing Peter to pay Paul or uh take
 
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
making it a nonzero sum game um that's
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
fine you're picking winners and losers
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
by doing that approach and that's why
 
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
from the association perspective and the
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
um associations from across the region
 
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
and different states the National
 
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
Association of broadcasters has taken
 
00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:44.839 align:start position:0%
the same advice to say let the federal
 
00:42:46.829 --> 00:42:46.839 align:start position:0%
government do this so I think our
 
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
perspective would be there's just a
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
better way to have this conversation
 
00:42:52.109 --> 00:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
than doing this peace Meal which brings
 
00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:55.079 align:start position:0%
forward a Financial Risk to our industry
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
we don't dispute the those claims about
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
there being benefits economically that
 
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
could be very broad but I think that
 
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
you're damaging one to create
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for another when I don't
 
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
think you have to do it that way thank
 
00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative goalie you
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
had a
 
00:43:14.549 --> 00:43:14.559 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:16.839 align:start position:0%
you Scott for taking my question good to
 
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
see you good to see you uh real quick
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
question we talk about going from Maine
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire to Massachusetts the
 
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
leap frog going down to Connecticut into
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
New York uh my question is as we talk
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
about those States isn't the Hampshire's
 
00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
legislation a little different in going
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
with the Atlantic time zone versus these
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
other states are going elsewhere in the
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
time zone yes sir that's part of the
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
challenge I think Scott Yates who
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
testified before um gave a good
 
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
cross-section you have like I said at
 
00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
the beginning of my testimony you have
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
different approaches to this
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
conversation some like ours are looking
 
00:43:55.549 --> 00:43:55.559 align:start position:0%
at moving to the Atlantic time zone
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
other St states have multiple proposals
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
in front of them to talk about just
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
eliminating daylight savings which would
 
00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
keep them in the Eastern Time Zone and
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
not do the shift and I think from the um
 
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
anti-c confusion side of the
 
00:44:10.829 --> 00:44:10.839 align:start position:0%
conversation I think that's another
 
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
reason why it's better to have this from
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
a macro conversation to avoid the com
 
00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
the the confusion of uh the potential in
 
00:44:20.589 --> 00:44:20.599 align:start position:0%
in this particular scenario of having
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
Maine Massachusetts and New Hampshire an
 
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
hour ahead of Connecticut Ro Rhode
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
Island Vermont and New York unless New
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
York and Connecticut go with which
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
leaves Rhode Island and Vermont out but
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
what about Pennsylvania like it can get
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
dizzyingly confusing especially when not
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
all of the states are going to recognize
 
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
the fallback spring forward concept of
 
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
daylight savings but some will so that
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
is why we're just suggesting that this
 
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
is a conversation best advised at the
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
top level and have a macro approach to
 
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
this um our our perspective is you know
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
pick your lane and just stay in the lane
 
00:44:59.470 --> 00:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
but do it from a big Regional
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
perspective Eastern Seaboard perspective
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
Federal perspective thank you sir thank
 
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair I I think I
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
lowered my hand again I decided that um
 
00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for my question has kind
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
of gone
 
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
P thank you representative sitec I can't
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
help uh good morning Mr Spradley I can't
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
help of your idea of using State
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
initiatives to pressure the federal
 
00:45:34.589 --> 00:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
government and marijuana comes to mind
 
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
but that's not my question this is a
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
fast irrelevant question does China have
 
00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
just one time zone I don't know yes they
 
00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
thought fair enough and and I I do I do
 
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate that representative yella has
 
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
that that sort of sense of frustration
 
00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
and limited faith in the malleability
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
and quick response of the federal
 
00:46:00.549 --> 00:46:00.559 align:start position:0%
government to jump in and do something
 
00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:02.839 align:start position:0%
about this so I completely get that and
 
00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:04.839 align:start position:0%
respect it um we're just worried about
 
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
the economic impact on broadcasters and
 
00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:08.839 align:start position:0%
how it could be damaging thank you
 
00:46:08.839 --> 00:46:10.390 align:start position:0%
how it could be damaging thank you
representative

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
Schultz hello Mr spradling great to see
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
you likewise um great points you
 
00:46:20.109 --> 00:46:20.119 align:start position:0%
probably heard my point uh from last
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
week and I'm just curious since there
 
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
are medium markets that do cover more
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
would cover probably at a Max two time
 
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
zones would that be a way to help
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
understand the best approach for media
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
markets that we deal with Excuse me of
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
Schulz you're co-sponsor you can't ask
 
00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
questions right I am so sorry that's
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
quite all right we will move on we have
 
00:46:52.829 --> 00:46:52.839 align:start position:0%
two other people to
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
testify Mr
 
00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.030 align:start position:0%
testify Mr
mser

00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.349 --> 00:47:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
you uh good morning I'm Tom mser from
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
quinsey Massachusetts uh and before I
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
read my prepared testimony which I
 
00:47:12.549 --> 00:47:12.559 align:start position:0%
promise is very brief I just want to
 
00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
respond to a couple of things that have
 
00:47:17.069 --> 00:47:17.079 align:start position:0%
been discussed thus far in the hearing
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
um um one by representative fellows
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
earlier uh she asked uh Mr Yates um if
 
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
any changes had happened since 2014 and
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe any changes have been
 
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
put into effect since 2014 but I want to
 
00:47:33.549 --> 00:47:33.559 align:start position:0%
remind the her and the committee that
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
the US Department of Transportation has
 
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
made a number of local time zone changes
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
over the past 20 years uh because it's
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
in its jurisdiction to do so for example
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh in 2010 Mercer County North Dakota
 
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
was relocated from Mountain Time to
 
00:47:52.349 --> 00:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
Central Time uh in 2007 when Indiana
 
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
decided to join daylight saving time uh
 
00:47:58.990 --> 00:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
a number of counties uh relocated in
 
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
across central eastern time to to do
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
what they preferred so uh it's it's
 
00:48:05.309 --> 00:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
within the Department's uh purview to
 
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
make these changes if they are
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
petitioned to do so by people who live
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
there uh and and what we're trying to do
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
representative yella and I and and
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
others and Mr Yates uh and you know
 
00:48:17.309 --> 00:48:17.319 align:start position:0%
people in Connecticut and other states
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
are saying if we band together we're
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
bigger than Mercer County North Dakota
 
00:48:22.829 --> 00:48:22.839 align:start position:0%
and we think we have a good argument to
 
00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
make uh nationally that this is what we
 
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
want to do is a community to move
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
forward with this time zone um another
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
point I'd like to make briefly is that
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh Arizona is surrounded by different
 
00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:37.720 align:start position:0%
time zones and eight months a year it is
 
00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
essentially on Advanced Standard time
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
which is basically what Atlantic
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
Standard time would be for New England
 
00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh where it joins California Oregon and
 
00:48:47.069 --> 00:48:47.079 align:start position:0%
Washington State so eight months a year
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's with the West Coast four months a
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
year it's with uh New Mexico and states
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the Mountain Time Zone uh and that's
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
okay I I don't you know I I I haven't
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
spoken to the Arizona broadcasters but I
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
imagine that they are are functioning
 
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
okay but but again this is this is not a
 
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
simple issue this is why we think we
 
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
should uh tread carefully we shouldn't
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
just as they do it did in the 7s we
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't decide you know on short
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
notice to go to daylight saving time all
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
year round you know that would not be a
 
00:49:20.829 --> 00:49:20.839 align:start position:0%
prudent thing to do we should do it
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully and I'm going to talk about
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
the commission we had in Massachusetts a
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
few years ago where we thought about
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
this issue in depth and the conclusions
 
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
we came to okay so thank you for
 
00:49:33.789 --> 00:49:33.799 align:start position:0%
indulging that um I'm here to ask for
 
00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
your support uh for h85 which would
 
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
extend New
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's observance of summertime
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
from eight months a year to year round
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
this Regional move is supported by the
 
00:49:45.309 --> 00:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
conclusion of a special Commission on
 
00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts time zone from
 
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.430 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts time zone from
November

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
November
 
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
2017 my involvement in this issue began
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
in 2014 when I penned a Boston Globe
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
oped titled why Mass should effect from
 
00:49:58.589 --> 00:49:58.599 align:start position:0%
its time zone the column became a topr
 
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
red article in the globe for several
 
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
days after it was published realizing I
 
00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:05.079 align:start position:0%
might have a workable idea on my hands I
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
contacted Massachusetts Senator John
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
Keenan's office and introduced a bill by
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
request to convene a commission to study
 
00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
the idea this is usually where the story
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
ends my understanding is that bills By
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
Request rarely go
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
anywhere so you can imagine my surprise
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
when I learned that the bill was added
 
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
to the 2016 Economic Development bill
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
before I knew it my little Bill that
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
could was a law I was nominated to serve
 
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
on the commission and we met throughout
 
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
2017 our report was issued about three
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
and a half years ago
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
Mr yes we have already received your
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%

you have any of the highlights that you
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%

have you read your testimony sure I
 
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate that uh the commission
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
endorsed the idea by vote of nine to1
 
00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
and said that we should move as a region
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
to Atlantic Standard
 
00:51:00.789 --> 00:51:00.799 align:start position:0%

representative thank you um I I have two
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
questions um one of them was one
 
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
question is the um a bill was introduced
 
00:52:04.349 --> 00:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
well first the first question is wasn't
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
there a
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
contingency in the report that of that
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
study committee that had to do with um
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
children waiting at bus stops in the
 
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
dark and the second question is uh there
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
was a bill Massachusetts Bill two two
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
and a half years ago and didn't seem to
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
go anywhere um did
 
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
it thank you for the question
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
representative fellows uh with the
 
00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
indulgent of the committee I'd like to
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
read the paragraph of my testimony that
 
00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:40.109 align:start position:0%
read the paragraph of my testimony that
addresses

00:52:40.109 --> 00:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
that uh I want to finally I want to
 
00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
address school start times it's true
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
that if we adopt this change in a vacuum
 
00:52:48.309 --> 00:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
we'd have kids walking to school in the
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
dark my wife and I have two children in
 
00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
elementary school I would never suggest
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
making a change that puts them or other
 
00:52:58.270 --> 00:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
children In Harm's Way we learned that
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
Pediatric Sleep Experts including Dr
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
Judith Owens of Boston Children's
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
Hospital who served on the commission
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
recommend that school not start until
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
8:30 a.m. well after an Atlantic
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
Standard Time
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
Sunrise uh your second question
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative fellows we did have a
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
bill last session introduced two years
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
ago uh to to make this change along with
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
three other states your state Maine and
 
00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island uh that bill did not pass
 
00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
so it has been reintroduced in the
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
legislature uh having having worked in
 
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
politics previously uh I'm am no
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
stranger to the legislative process it
 
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
is very very slow I introduced I I wrote
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
the oped seven years ago um and you know
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
we had a commission meet over the course
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
of a year um so this is not again this
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
is not a a short-term fix nor should it
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
nor should it
 
00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
be thank you you representative Schmidt
 
00:53:58.349 --> 00:53:58.359 align:start position:0%
you had a
 
00:54:02.109 --> 00:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair uh so Mr
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
mwell would you opine with regard to
 
00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
where you would recommend with relate
 
00:54:15.069 --> 00:54:15.079 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
suntime that we try to get this cons
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
Consortium the best use of
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
the which time zone should we wind up
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
going to if we can put this all together
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
sure I would recommend we stick with the
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
time that New Hampshire is already on
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
eight months the year and that is we
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
call it now eastern daylight time but in
 
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
a permanent sense we would call it
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
Atlantic Standard Time eight months a
 
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
year there would be no change the only
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
change we'd experience is from early
 
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
November to early March where we would
 
00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:49.910 align:start position:0%
November to early March where we would
not

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
change thank you thank you other
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:05.789 --> 00:55:05.799 align:start position:0%
P mute hello hello good morning um thank
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
you for having me here and it's an honor
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
to be here my name is JP I'm the founder
 
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
of safe Standard Time a nonprofit public
 
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:13.640 align:start position:0%
benefit campaign working throughout
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
North America and I'm here to ask that
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
you oppose this bill
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
hb85 or at least refer it to the
 
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
Committees on children and
 
00:55:23.549 --> 00:55:23.559 align:start position:0%
education and certainly recommend that
 
00:55:26.029 --> 00:55:26.039 align:start position:0%
you amend uh certainly that you
 
00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
recommend its amendment to permanent
 
00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
Eastern Standard Time uh the bill seeks
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
to unclock change which is a good idea
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
but it goes about it the wrong way by
 
00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
seeking Atlantic time Atlantic time is
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
objectively the wrong time zone for New
 
00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's longitude your East West
 
00:55:44.589 --> 00:55:44.599 align:start position:0%
location on the earth is in the Eastern
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
Time Zone Atlantic time coincides with
 
00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:50.839 align:start position:0%
eastern daylight time it is permanent
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
DST by another name it's an extension of
 
00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
DST into the winter and there's a big
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
reason why we don't observe DST in the
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
winter and that's because it makes the
 
00:56:02.349 --> 00:56:02.359 align:start position:0%
sunrise dangerously late currently your
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
latest Sunrise is
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
7:24 a.m. this bill would delay that to
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
8:24 a.m. most school and work days
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
begin around 8 a so for two months late
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
November to early February you would be
 
00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
forcing most people to start school or
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
work in the dark they wouldn't see
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
sunlight until their lunch break or even
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
until the end of the day and that is
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
danger and it's
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
depressing artificially delayed Sunrise
 
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
reduces sleep it reduces immunity it
 
00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
increases illness and accidents clocks
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
are not arbitrary and when we do things
 
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
matters if you were to ask most people
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
would they willingly set their alarm
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
clocks an hour early every day would
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
they wake themselves hours before
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
sunrise in the cold of winter they would
 
00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
say no but that's what permanent DST or
 
00:56:52.589 --> 00:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
Atlantic time in New Hampshire would
 
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
mean for them this this this measure uh
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
this concept this policy permanent DST
 
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
was hugely unpopular in World War II it
 
00:57:02.829 --> 00:57:02.839 align:start position:0%
was again hugely unpopular and it was
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
even lethal when it was tried again in
 
00:57:07.789 --> 00:57:07.799 align:start position:0%
the 1970s oil crisis countries that try
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
permanent DST do not adjust instead they
 
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:13.720 align:start position:0%
sleep less their health suffers and they
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
eventually revert it this policy is
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
opposed by the national PTA the national
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
Safety Council the American Academy of
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
sleep medicine and many more
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
organizations every advocacy group for
 
00:57:27.789 --> 00:57:27.799 align:start position:0%
health safety and children's well-being
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
that has spoken on this issue urges
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
instead for permanent observation of
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
geographically correct Standard Time
 
00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
permanent Eastern Standard Time Keeps
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
your sunrises before 8 am. it saves your
 
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
morning sunlight which doctors tell us
 
00:57:44.349 --> 00:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
is most necessary for our mood our
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
health our safety our learning and our
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
productivity morning sunlight helps you
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
wake naturally it helps you feel good
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
and active and on time it keeps you
 
00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:55.480 align:start position:0%
healthy and alert
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh permanent Eastern Standard Time is
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
also pre-approved by federal law which
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
would make this the quickest and easiest
 
00:58:02.829 --> 00:58:02.839 align:start position:0%
way to end the unpopular clock
 
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
change so I ask that you please listen
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
to scientists and doctors and teachers
 
00:58:09.029 --> 00:58:09.039 align:start position:0%
and parents do not repeat the bad
 
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:11.240 align:start position:0%
history stop this bill until it is
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
amended to permanent Eastern Standard
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
Time and I thank you very much for your
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
time and your
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
service thank you are there any
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
questions from Mr representative
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
Pearson yeah I have I have a question
 
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
about something you just said you said
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
the federal government has already
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
preapproved the dropping of daylight
 
00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
savings time for the East Coast for
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
every state the 1966 uniform time act um
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
requires that you observe uh your your
 
00:58:43.029 --> 00:58:43.039 align:start position:0%
proper time zone and it asks that you
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
change your clocks only on the specified
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
dates or not at all so that's the route
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
that Arizona and Hawaii and all US
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
territories have taken is that they just
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
do not spring forward they do not fall
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
back they stay on their Standard Time so
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
for you in New Hampshire that would be
 
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
staying on Eastern Standard Time and how
 
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
you decide that is is an internal matter
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
state thank you other
 
00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none is there
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to testify on
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
85 okay seeing none thank you all I'm

01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
this issue of uh facial recognition
 
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
software uh to make it clear right off
 
01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
the bat I
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
support the HB 499 as it is as it was
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
submitted I do not support the
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
amendment uh I don't know if the
 
01:01:11.789 --> 01:01:11.799 align:start position:0%
Amendments been introduced or not I
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
wasn't here for the last for the first
 
01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:15.319 align:start position:0%
half of the
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
hearing okay so I oppos that Amendment
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
it was if I refer to it I refer to it
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
generally as the hopper Amendment
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
because that's how to iary referred to
 
01:01:28.349 --> 01:01:28.359 align:start position:0%
it last term when it considered that
 
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment at at some length first of all
 
01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.109 align:start position:0%
Amendment at at some length first of all
my

01:01:32.109 --> 01:01:32.119 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
history uh may be relevant uh at the
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
time I retired I was Vermont senior
 
01:01:42.029 --> 01:01:42.039 align:start position:0%
public defender in terms of uh longevity
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of number of cases handled and
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
the like so I represented criminals
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
alleged criminals as well as uh in
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
Family Court others for 34 years incl
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
including sexual offenders against
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
children and the like which will be
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
relevant today I know how search
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
warrants work arrest warrants work I've
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
handled hundreds if not thousands of of
 
01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:10.279 align:start position:0%
of such documents I've litigated them
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
and the like um I know how sexual
 
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
offenders against children operate how
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
they meet how they find victims and how
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
they use the internet and frankly the
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
internet has been the best thing around
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh from a pedophile's point of
 
01:02:32.589 --> 01:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
view um and as a result of that we have
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
um organizations and um task forces that
 
01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
have uh that are utilized to to fight
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
pedophilia and similar crimes uh
 
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
internet crimes against children task
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
force in fact we fund and uh there's
 
01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
National organizations International
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
organizations such as interpole and the
 
01:03:00.029 --> 01:03:00.039 align:start position:0%
like okay uh in how does facial
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
recognition software uh affect all of
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
this internet recognition software is
 
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.230 align:start position:0%
this internet recognition software is
not

01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
evidence it is a tool it's not admitted
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
into evidence in court it's used by
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
police to develop um leads and to
 
01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.069 align:start position:0%
police to develop um leads and to
develop

01:03:21.069 --> 01:03:21.079 align:start position:0%
develop
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
evidence um it's used for instance
 
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
uh to compare an image of a potential
 
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
child sexual uh victim to known images
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
of of known people to to link them up
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's used to compare a picture taken at
 
01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
a cre crime scene uh to a database of
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
mug shots to identify potential uh
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
suspects uh it's used to um compare a
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
cell phone image of an unconscious
 
01:03:57.269 --> 01:03:57.279 align:start position:0%

01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
or develop
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
leads so let me start with a a simple
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
hypothetical average case the a law
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer legally
 
01:04:14.269 --> 01:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
has um uh a thousand
 
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
images of uh what may be children in
 
01:04:21.549 --> 01:04:21.559 align:start position:0%
sexually suggested poses you don't know
 
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
if it's a child or not because you don't
 
01:04:27.069 --> 01:04:27.079 align:start position:0%
know who that image is of if it's an
 
01:04:29.269 --> 01:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
adult it's not a crime if it's a child
 
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
it could be a very serious crime so the
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer contacts
 
01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
Interpol or other similar organizations
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
that have these huge databases and sees
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
if there's a match and that's what
 
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
facial recognition technology uses and
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
they will go and say Bing we've got a
 
01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
match and that picture there
 
01:04:57.069 --> 01:04:57.079 align:start position:0%
of this unidentified person on this
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
computer matches up with a picture we
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
have in our file and we could tell you
 
01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
that's a picture of Grace Jones and
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
Grace Jones that picture she was 14
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
years old at the time and the picture is
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
uh two years
 
01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
old now the law enforcement officer has
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
evidence probable cause to say a crime
 
01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
has been committed goes to the court
 
01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
gets a warrant and uh and and proceeds
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
from there that's kind of your standard
 
01:05:27.599 --> 01:05:28.750 align:start position:0%
from there that's kind of your standard
operating

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
operating
 
01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
procedure what the amendment does here
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does here is
 
01:05:36.079 --> 01:05:37.589 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does here is
eliminate

01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
that process of developing the probable
 
01:05:45.069 --> 01:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
cause because it would force the law
 
01:05:48.109 --> 01:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer to go to court with
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
just this unidentified picture which may
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
or may not be of an underage child and
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
go to a judge and sayi got a picture
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
here um and it might be evidence of a
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
crime and it might not be and I don't
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
know but I want you to get me a
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
warrant it's not going to
 
01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
happen and that's the problem with the
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
amendment that that we have here so what
 
01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
would be the
 
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
effect well unfortunately pedophiles are
 
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
very knowledgeable about the internet
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
they're very knowledgeable about police
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
techniques they're very knowledgeable
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
about warrant they know how to operate
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
where it's safe and where it's not
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
safe no other state to my knowledge has
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
adopted this amendment so what's going
 
01:06:41.069 --> 01:06:41.079 align:start position:0%
to happen is your pedophiles are going
 
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
to operate at a New
 
01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you may think that's a good
 
01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
thing you may think it's a bad thing I
 
01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
suspect all of you think that would be a
 
01:06:53.269 --> 01:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
bad thing uh pedophiles are mobile they
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
will go to where where their victims are
 
01:06:58.109 --> 01:06:58.119 align:start position:0%
uh which is why folks like detective
 
01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
mlin and Keane spent you know 15 years
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
sitting in front of a computer
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
pretending to be an underage sexually
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
active child and luring people um into
 
01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and arresting them when
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
they've done a bad thing in New
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the pedophiles will go to
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
where their victims go and if New
 
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the only place in the
 
01:07:24.269 --> 01:07:24.279 align:start position:0%
United States the only state in the
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
United States that lacks the ability to
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
effectively go after them um then uh
 
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to come here you can also
 
01:07:37.269 --> 01:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
think of the riots that happened in DC
 
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
at the capol in January
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
6th uh regardless of whether your
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
political beliefs are uh about people
 
01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
joining there or going there there's I
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
think a general belief that a number of
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
people misbehaved inside the inside
 
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
inside the capital identifying those
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
people and charging them is done through
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
facial recognition software by and large
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
everybody was taking pictures of each
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
other and and there's people that show
 
01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
up in the background and things like
 
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
that um and uh facial recognition tech
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
software is used to identify leads then
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
people go to court all right anyway I
 
01:08:24.269 --> 01:08:24.279 align:start position:0%
was contacted by the prime sponsor last
 
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
fall and asked if I could develop a
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
bill that would limit the use of facial
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
recognition software while preserving
 
01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
civil liberties and I said I I would
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
make that effort and that's what the
 
01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill HB 499 is it's based on
 
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
a proposed bipartisan bill that's in the
 
01:08:51.870 --> 01:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
Senate there nothing much is moving in
 
01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate so it's kind of sitting there
 
01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
on one side is Senator Chris Coons and
 
01:08:59.149 --> 01:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
the other co-sponsor on the other side
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
is Mike Lee and they represent you know
 
01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
two different sides of the aisle it's
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
supported by groups such as Americans
 
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.630 align:start position:0%
supported by groups such as Americans
for

01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
Prosperity um and uh HP 499 is based on
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
a couple of principles one New Hampshire
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
should establish appropriate guard rails
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
around the use of facial recognition
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
technology to ensure Granite Staters are
 
01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
safe without infringing civil liberties
 
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
two the persistent and targeted use of
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
this technology should be subject to
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
similar procedural guidelines as other
 
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
investigative techniques that raise
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
comparable privacy concerns so this bill
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
would require law enforcement to obtain
 
01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.070 align:start position:0%
would require law enforcement to obtain
a

01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
warrant to use facial recognition
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
technology to conduct on ongoing
 
01:09:54.719 --> 01:09:57.590 align:start position:0%
technology to conduct on ongoing
targeted

01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
targeted
 
01:10:00.189 --> 01:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
surveillance a warrant based on probable
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
cause would be required to use this
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
technology if you want to surveil an
 
01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
individual for more than 72
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
hours it can only be used under this
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
bill can only be used for surveillance
 
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
of a specific person surveillance of a
 
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
group would require a
 
01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
warrant the facial recognition
 
01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
technology in this bill is
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
barred for use without a warrant after
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
the individual has been
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
identified and there's an escape hatch
 
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
saying if there's an emergency or
 
01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
exigent circumstances it would allow
 
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
surveillance without a
 
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
warrant so what this bill does in short
 
01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:47.430 align:start position:0%
warrant so what this bill does in short
is

01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
balance civil liberties by limiting its
 
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
scope limiting its duration
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
limiting who can be
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
surveilled and still allows the police
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
work necessary to develop the probable
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
cause to go to court to get the
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
warrant so it shouldn't harm decent
 
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
police work and it balances that with
 
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
civil liberties so I urge this committee
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
to adopt the original Bill HB
 
01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
499 and to reject the uh the amendment
 
01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:25.510 align:start position:0%
499 and to reject the uh the amendment
thank

01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
comme repr fellow um yes uh
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
representative Bert I'm just wondering
 
01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
if you think there's any Middle Ground
 
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
amendment the original bill is is really
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
designed to be the middle ground between
 
01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.470 align:start position:0%
designed to be the middle ground between
what

01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
is and and barring facial recognition
 
01:12:06.669 --> 01:12:06.679 align:start position:0%
technology so the original bill is the
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
compromise between the two the pro what
 
01:12:11.629 --> 01:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here and why there
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
really isn't a middle ground is we're
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
talking about at what point do you get
 
01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.430 align:start position:0%
talking about at what point do you get
the

01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
warrant and the the amendment says you
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
get the warrant you have to get the
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
warrant basically at the very very very
 
01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
beginning and warrants just aren't going
 
01:12:30.669 --> 01:12:30.679 align:start position:0%
to be granted
 
01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
then the HB 499 is drafted allows the
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
development of probable cause but puts
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
the restrictions on the technology after
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
the warrant is gotten so that's kind of
 
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
the core difference and I don't see how
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
there thank you other other
 
01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.189 align:start position:0%
there thank you other other
questions

01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for represent thank
 
01:13:06.629 --> 01:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
call good morning Madam chair this is
 
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
jeie hesa I'm going to testify on behalf
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
of the ACLU on this bill if that's
 
01:13:27.149 --> 01:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.189 --> 01:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
got that's that's on the later bill I'm
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
sorry for the confusion but good morning
 
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
my name is Jeanie hesa I'm the political
 
01:13:35.629 --> 01:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
director for the American civil
 
01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
liberties Union of New Hampshire and I I
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
really appreciate this commit uh work on
 
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
facial recognition technology I want to
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
start by saying the ACLU actually
 
01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
supports a ban on this technology we are
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
deeply concerned about how invasive this
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
technology is in terms of privacy rights
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
um and are concerned about the fact that
 
01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
this technology is inaccurate it it is
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
particularly inaccurate and identifying
 
01:14:04.990 --> 01:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
people of color young people and older
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
people it's essentially a good
 
01:14:08.189 --> 01:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
technology if you're trying to identify
 
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
middle-aged white guys but this is not a
 
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
reliable Tech otherwise and so we we
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
actually start from the premise that we
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
should ban it completely um which is
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
actually what this committee did last
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
session um when it passed a bill that
 
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
would have banned the State's use of
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
this Tech um so we oppose the current
 
01:14:28.629 --> 01:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
version of this bill that is being
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
presented this session because hb99 as
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's written is pro- facial recognition
 
01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:37.960 align:start position:0%
it allows unregulated use of this
 
01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
invasive inacurate technology for up to
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
72 hours so in responding to one of the
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
questions previously asked we actually
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
think the amendment that representative
 
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
Smith proposed last week is is the
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
compromise because it it allowing facial
 
01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
recognition technology to be used with
 
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
just a warrant is certainly a compromise
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
from from where we stand in terms of our
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
ideal of prohibiting the tech um but we
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
accept that that compromise may be just
 
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
that it's a way to split the baby and at
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
least require police to get a warrant
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
before using this technology I want to
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
note that facial recognition when it
 
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
when it's inaccurate it's not that it
 
01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:25.719 align:start position:0%
fails to identify you it's that it
 
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
identifies you as the wrong person so
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
there have been multiple instances
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
across the country of people being
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
wrongly identified by facial recognition
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
technology and being arrested for
 
01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
something they didn't do um the police
 
01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
show up on somebody's doorstep and says
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know facial recognition identified
 
01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:47.719 align:start position:0%
you as the person who did this crime
 
01:15:50.669 --> 01:15:50.679 align:start position:0%
when lo and behold it's the wrong person
 
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
and yet somebody's being arrested
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
they're being taken in in um simply
 
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
because this technology wrongly
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
identified them that's a concern that
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
really needs to be safeguarded against
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
and at a minimum at least a warrant is
 
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
some measure of a
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
safeguard um and again I want to note
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
that other jurisdictions in response to
 
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
the representative burch's concerns um
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
about whether criminals would come to
 
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire other jurisdictions are
 
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
Banning this technology there've been a
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
number of cities across the country that
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
have banned this technology um even
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
Amazon has actually imposed a one-year
 
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
moratorium on the use by law enforcement
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
of its facial recognition technology so
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
again the amendment is a compromise the
 
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
amendment is a middle ground between
 
01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
complete unregulated use of this
 
01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
technology um and creating some measure
 
01:16:54.629 --> 01:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
of a safeguard um so I'm happy to answer
 
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
questions um I have submitted lengthy
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
written testimony and I I don't want to
 
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
bore you with it all um but we strongly
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
support the amendment and really
 
01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
encourage this committee to take the
 
01:17:07.470 --> 01:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to build a safeguard um I'll
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
just Note One Last point we are
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
concerned about facial recognition
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
becoming in abundant use and only then
 
01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:17.320 align:start position:0%
having the legislature try and regulate
 
01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
it um I would note GPS tracking
 
01:17:22.629 --> 01:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
technology which is in widespread use
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
right now right by law enforcement by
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
security companies and there are a
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
number of bills every single session
 
01:17:31.629 --> 01:17:31.639 align:start position:0%
that try and and create guard rails
 
01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
after the fact regarding GPS tracking
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
technology and it's simply too hard to
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
put the genie back in the bottle once a
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
technology is in ubiquitous use so this
 
01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity for this committee to
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
be proactive and to build safeguards
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
around a technology before it's in
 
01:17:53.229 --> 01:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous use so your timing is
 
01:17:55.709 --> 01:17:55.719 align:start position:0%
exceptional right now um and with that
 
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer questions thank you
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative Roy thank you mad chair
 
01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um my question is you
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned several jurisdictions across
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
the country that have b this
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
technology share
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
those uh sure I'm just pulling it up on
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
my uh testimony so facial surveillance
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
technology has been banned in San
 
01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
Francisco Oakland Portland Maine and
 
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
several towns in Massachusetts including
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
cluding Boston the Massachusetts
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
legislature actually passed legislation
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
last year that would have banned it um
 
01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
banned this technology by the state um
 
01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
so this part of it is there's been real
 
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
momentum uh to ban this technology since
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
last summer um because of how inaccurate
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
facial recognition is specifically in
 
01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
identifying people of color um and so
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
there's a racial Justice uh lens to this
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
um which again you know uh white men are
 
01:18:58.110 --> 01:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
the ones that tend to be accurately
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
identified um and it's it's people of
 
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
color who tend to be wrongly identified
 
01:19:05.629 --> 01:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
and therefore wrongly arrested um so a
 
01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
lot of these jurisdictions are Banning
 
01:19:10.629 --> 01:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
this technology in response to that um
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
and on that this is one of the reasons I
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
would just note why we supported the
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
prohibition last session is if you ban
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
the technology now you know you allow
 
01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
tech companies to come back to the
 
01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
legislature in two or three years and
 
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
say hey guess what we've improved it
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
we've addressed all the inaccuracies we
 
01:19:28.629 --> 01:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
we fix we fixed the algorithm it's now a
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
great reliable technology and the
 
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
legislature can then allow its use when
 
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's a more reliable Tech but we should
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
start from from the the position of
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
safety and that is at least restricting
 
01:19:45.629 --> 01:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
the use of this technology right
 
01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
now thank are there other questions from
 
01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
algro thank you for making my question
 
01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh m r i I have a question that I've
 
01:19:59.070 --> 01:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
seen they're trying to be made a
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
distinction between
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
um Information Technology surveillance
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
versus regular let let me try to
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
abbreviate this as much as
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
possible often search and seizure or
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
violations of search and seizure um are
 
01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
cases of entering offices or uh forcing
 
01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
someone to reveal the information in
 
01:20:25.709 --> 01:20:25.719 align:start position:0%
their wallet their identification and so
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
forth uh this
 
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
is we wouldn't allow that to develop um
 
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
probable cause you can't break into
 
01:20:37.709 --> 01:20:37.719 align:start position:0%
somebody's office and search their files
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
without a um without a warrant so what
 
01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
distinguishes this from that is this not
 
01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
simply and purely never mind the
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
technology is this not simply and purely
 
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
just a uh allowing uh violation of the
 
01:20:57.870 --> 01:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
fourth amendment to develop uh a
 
01:20:59.830 --> 01:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
probable cause which we do not do under
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
any other circumstances in
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
theory I I want to make sure I'm answer
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding the question are you
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
saying in the absence of this
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
legislation would facial recognition
 
01:21:12.669 --> 01:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
constitute a violation of the fourth
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
amendment I guess the shorter way to ask
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
the question is should there be middle
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
ground that would allow uh law
 
01:21:22.990 --> 01:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement to enter someone's home and
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
search their
 
01:21:24.159 --> 01:21:25.790 align:start position:0%
search their
files

01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
files
 
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh and if not why should there be middle
 
01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
ground for someone to use uh facial
 
01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
technology to facial recognition
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
technology to develop problem cause
 
01:21:39.629 --> 01:21:39.639 align:start position:0%
without a I mean I I think I'm
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
understanding where you're going which
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
is I think where you're coming from is
 
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
where we're coming from which is this
 
01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
technology um is dangerous from the
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
moment you start using it right if you
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
allow 72 hours of use all of the dangers
 
01:21:56.189 --> 01:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
of facial recognition technology will be
 
01:21:59.470 --> 01:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
experienced in those first 72 hours like
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
the the dangers of this Tech don't
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
suddenly multiply at the 72h hour Mark
 
01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
um this technology is invasive in that
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
if it is used to identify you right
 
01:22:15.629 --> 01:22:15.639 align:start position:0%
somebody can run your face through a
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
facial recognition software and produce
 
01:22:21.629 --> 01:22:21.639 align:start position:0%
some me some identity whether it's
 
01:22:23.229 --> 01:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
accurate or not as a question but come
 
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
up with some name very very quickly
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
within minutes potentially that that is
 
01:22:30.910 --> 01:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
still a violation of privacy that they
 
01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
have done that and so there should be a
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
warrant at the onset like before they
 
01:22:39.070 --> 01:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
use the technology there shouldn't be
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
this like 72h hour window where you can
 
01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
do all sorts of surveillance and only at
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
72 hours do we start to regulate
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
it thank you that did answer my question
 
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
even though it wasn't put quite so
 
01:22:55.149 --> 01:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
clearly any
 
01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
question seeing none thank you oh excuse
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
me representative Schmidt has a
 
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair uh good
 
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
morning Jean uh so you heard
 
01:23:09.870 --> 01:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
representative bur's testimony I presume
 
01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
and he says you ain't going to get a
 
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:16.280 align:start position:0%
warrant um under the
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh that the bill
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
foresees uh what is your response to
 
01:23:22.159 --> 01:23:23.510 align:start position:0%
foresees uh what is your response to
that

01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm afraid I'm going to have to
 
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree with
 
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
representative Burch on that I think if
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
you went to a court with a photograph in
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
the instance that he
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
described um where you're where you're
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
simply trying to ID somebody in the
 
01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
photo um I think the court would give a
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
warrant in that instance but again it's
 
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
a case by casee situation I think the
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
struggle with that example is you know
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
police don't stumble a across a photo on
 
01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
the sidewalk and go take it to a j judge
 
01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
there would be some reason that the
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
police would believe that that photo is
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
relevant um so I certainly think that if
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
in that kind of flushed out hypothetical
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
I think a search warrant could be
 
01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
obtained follow up followup thank you
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for your answer
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
Jean so what is your response to the uh
 
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
to the obviously very
 
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
significant uh child uh sexual predator
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh issue that we confront in this
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
country and of course we have it here in
 
01:24:32.270 --> 01:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as well so you could
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm not I mean I I don't want
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
to get into how do we address that issue
 
01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
broadly in terms of facial recognition I
 
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
guess I would say two things um we've
 
01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:46.669 align:start position:0%
guess I would say two things um we've
been

01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
fighting that issue long before facial
 
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
recognition technology came along right
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
there's always these references to the
 
01:24:57.109 --> 01:24:57.119 align:start position:0%
toolbx to the broad number of tools that
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
police have and they still have access
 
01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
to that broad number of tools so I don't
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
think this issue makes or breaks law
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement's ability to address child
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
abuse and child
 
01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:11.800 align:start position:0%
pornography um or child trafficking so I
 
01:25:13.229 --> 01:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
don't think this is going to be the make
 
01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
or break issue and also I don't think
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
requiring a warrant is a hurdle warrants
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
are very standard law enforcement tools
 
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
and they are used exactly in this
 
01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
scenario where you are
 
01:25:31.109 --> 01:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
balancing law enforcements duties and
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities with the civil rights
 
01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
of the public and I think a warrant it
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
is used in so many situations that it's
 
01:25:44.189 --> 01:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
just natural to extend that to this
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
technology thank you thank you other
 
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none oh wait a second
 
01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative fellow
 
01:25:56.669 --> 01:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
um yes I just thank you I just wanted to
 
01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:01.400 align:start position:0%
ask um are there any controls on the FBI
 
01:26:05.229 --> 01:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
or federal agents using um facial
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
recognition and if not are there any
 
01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
proposals out there to do so
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative follows this is New
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have no control over what
 
01:26:19.629 --> 01:26:19.639 align:start position:0%
the FBI does or what they do they accept
 
01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
in federal courts what we have to deal
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
courts yeah we can't the FBI is not
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
under our jurisdiction I'm sorry to
 
01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
say that is right the only thing I would
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
add to that representative is that there
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
are National conversations right now
 
01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
about um the federal government's use of
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
this technology because again the same
 
01:26:48.629 --> 01:26:48.639 align:start position:0%
concerns about the state using it apply
 
01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
to the federal government using it um so
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
the conversation that we're having right
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
now is happening in other states and and
 
01:26:57.550 --> 01:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
is happening in
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh there's someone else
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:30.149 align:start position:0%
 
Eber

01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
you should be able to speak now Mr eirt
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
yourself good morning are you able to
 
01:27:51.310 --> 01:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
hear me now yes thank you I apologize
 
01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
very much for the the delay there uh a
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
little bit of a technical difficulty my
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
name is Joe Ebert I am a captain with
 
01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
the state police I oversee the
 
01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
Investigative Services Bureau and I
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate very much the opportunity to
 
01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
address the committee today I think that
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
there's been a a great deal of
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
discussion about uh uh the usefulness of
 
01:28:14.109 --> 01:28:14.119 align:start position:0%
facial recognition technology and the uh
 
01:28:16.510 --> 01:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
the guard rails that I understandably
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
the there are some that want to put in
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
place I uh am in certainly in agreement
 
01:28:23.709 --> 01:28:23.719 align:start position:0%
with represent of birch that I'm
 
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
concerned that the uh that the amendment
 
01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
as proposed would uh put law enforcement
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
in a position where it would be
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
difficult if not impossible to obtain a
 
01:28:38.189 --> 01:28:38.199 align:start position:0%
a warrant um because I I I'm I'm not
 
01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
certain that we would be able to develop
 
01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:41.719 align:start position:0%
probable cause by the at the point at
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
which it's uh being required I I would
 
01:28:47.229 --> 01:28:47.239 align:start position:0%
say to you that I'm I'm very much uh
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
understanding of the fact that nobody uh
 
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
nobody that I work with and certainly
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
not the division of State Police wants
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
to um wrongly accuse somebody or wrongly
 
01:28:59.189 --> 01:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
Target somebody that is uh uh it should
 
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
go without saying but we are ardly
 
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
against that uh but this is uh we have
 
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
found that facial recognition is uh a
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
part a piece to an investigation
 
01:29:09.430 --> 01:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
investigations that we've done here in
 
01:29:11.709 --> 01:29:11.719 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire um by
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
utilizing outside agencies uh when we
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
have joint
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
investigations and you know I think that
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's very important to highlight that uh
 
01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:24.639 align:start position:0%
facial recognition in and of itself uh
 
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
should not be the only determining
 
01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:29.560 align:start position:0%
Factor as to who an individual is um but
 
01:29:33.390 --> 01:29:33.400 align:start position:0%
to uh prohibit it as a tool to uh
 
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
working toward discovering who an
 
01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
individual is really puts I you know for
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term handcuffs on on
 
01:29:43.149 --> 01:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
law enforcement so I I would just uh
 
01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
encourage you to uh to give
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
consideration give great consideration
 
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
to the fact that uh this is a you know
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
as has been said before this is a tool
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
that we utilize uh you know and we have
 
01:29:58.510 --> 01:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
found uh that even in cases here in the
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh one that comes
 
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
to mind specifically was a a a DMV case
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
an investigation that took place where
 
01:30:09.790 --> 01:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
we utilized uh this uh technology in our
 
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
in accordance with our partners in other
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
states uh and what we found was that
 
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
there were individuals who are
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
fraudulently obtaining driver licenses
 
01:30:19.629 --> 01:30:19.639 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire and
 
01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
again uh you know this was done uh
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
because it was a joint uh Endeavor but
 
01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
it was it what it showed us is we were
 
01:30:30.910 --> 01:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
fallible uh in our DMV system for
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
individuals coming in um and obtaining
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
one or two or three licenses uh because
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
we were not utilizing this technology so
 
01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
again I just wanted to put forward as a
 
01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
a thought that we really and truly
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
believe that uh that this is just one
 
01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
tool um of many and and I I really would
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
look forward to to the opportunity to
 
01:30:54.189 --> 01:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
continue to work on this bill I think
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
there's certainly middle ground that can
 
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
be found so with that I thank you so
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
much for the uh the time to address you
 
01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
this morning and I'm absolutely willing
 
01:31:04.830 --> 01:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
to listen to any uh questions thank you
 
01:31:06.669 --> 01:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
representative Roy has a
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
see um you speak to if you're able to um
 
01:31:19.030 --> 01:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
what the representative from the ACL
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
repr so representative Roy thank you so
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
much for the uh uh the question I uh I
 
01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
really cannot speak to uh the details of
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
of that statement however I'm I'm I'm
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
more than willing to uh research that
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
and provide the committee with uh with
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
what I find what I would uh put forward
 
01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
to you and what I would put forward to
 
01:31:49.149 --> 01:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
the committee is
 
01:31:52.030 --> 01:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
that eyewitness identification is also
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
fall um and in and of itself should not
 
01:31:59.229 --> 01:31:59.239 align:start position:0%
be taken um as one piece of evidence
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
that stand alone so I guess part of me
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
says that I'm not surprised that there
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
is some fallibility to uh digital
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
identification as well which is why
 
01:32:11.470 --> 01:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
digital ident identification uh in and
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
of itself should not be used singularly
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
so I my response to your question is a
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know that research but I'm
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
happy to look into it and B uh I think
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's typical of anything we find
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
one piece of evidence in and of itself
 
01:32:31.109 --> 01:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
is very rarely uh a standalone
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
prosecutable case is built on that it it
 
01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
has to be built on a number of different
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
things um so the fact that there may be
 
01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
an inaccuracy there I certainly hope
 
01:32:42.030 --> 01:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
that the rest of the investigation would
 
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
flesh out uh what that inaccuracy
 
01:32:49.709 --> 01:32:49.719 align:start position:0%
was follow up thank you
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
just would um
 
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
you would you would never apply for a
 
01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
warrant an arrest warrant simply based
 
01:33:01.149 --> 01:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
on a hit faal recognition without doing
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
some further
 
01:33:05.709 --> 01:33:05.719 align:start position:0%
investigation no no so um and that's a
 
01:33:07.229 --> 01:33:07.239 align:start position:0%
great point and I think that that was
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
actually uh brought up uh by a prior uh
 
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
witness which is it's it is a part of an
 
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
investigation but as a standalone piece
 
01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
of evidence I would never uh go to a
 
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
judge and simply say I have this hit
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
that came from this system that we know
 
01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
is not 100% but is very good but we know
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
it's not 100% I would never stand before
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
a judge and say and therefore I need a
 
01:33:33.870 --> 01:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
warrant Lee not an arrest War yeah
 
01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:43.070 align:start position:0%
warrant Lee not an arrest War yeah
representative

01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:48.270 --> 01:33:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:51.310 --> 01:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
muted my apologies thank you Madame
 
01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:52.310 align:start position:0%
muted my apologies thank you Madame
chair

01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
Mr Heber um could you please tell us
 
01:33:58.709 --> 01:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
your how this am this bill and with or
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
without the amendment would change the
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
way um the state police or the law
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement is operating in the United
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
States now and if you can't answer the
 
01:34:11.870 --> 01:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
question could you please get us the
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
information so what my question is how
 
01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
would things change with the bill and
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
how would it change with the bill and
 
01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment can you compare those two
 
01:34:23.790 --> 01:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
to what you're doing now I can try ma'am
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
and I I will uh and I absolutely commit
 
01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
to uh getting you further information on
 
01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
an analysis of that um I think the
 
01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
original bill as it stood when I
 
01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
reviewed that bill my uh my concern with
 
01:34:37.950 --> 01:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
that bill was in the subsection I think
 
01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
was evidence admissible where it talked
 
01:34:43.709 --> 01:34:43.719 align:start position:0%
about uh utilization of an outside uh
 
01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:46.360 align:start position:0%
entity's uh facial recognition system
 
01:34:47.629 --> 01:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
would have to be in compliance with the
 
01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire standards I think that
 
01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
that bill as as I look at that would
 
01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
certainly change the way that um we are
 
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
operating now because it's very hard for
 
01:34:59.550 --> 01:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
uh us to impose on say the federal
 
01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
government or another state our um our
 
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
rules and our regulations uh as it deals
 
01:35:08.189 --> 01:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
with the amendment the amendment is
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
asking for a search warrant to be in
 
01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
place which is not currently uh what is
 
01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
required now so I think the the
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
amendment's a little bit easier um and
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
again my interpretation of the original
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
bill um I I very openly tell you may or
 
01:35:24.109 --> 01:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
may not be accurate but that was my
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
takeaway under that Evans admissible
 
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
portion um that that was what would
 
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
change our operating structure as it
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
stands now I hope that's answered the
 
01:35:36.910 --> 01:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
question yes followup please
 
01:35:39.310 --> 01:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
followup and um but the amendment
 
01:35:40.669 --> 01:35:40.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything doesn't really
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
change anything about the admissible
 
01:35:45.070 --> 01:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
evidence correct uh well I think it does
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
I I and again ma'am I I I I ask you to I
 
01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
I don't have the I have the screen up of
 
01:35:52.990 --> 01:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the hearing and not the uh the
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
bill itself but I would ask you to uh to
 
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
look under that uh admissibility where
 
01:35:59.709 --> 01:35:59.719 align:start position:0%
there was a statement in the original
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
bill which I think said something to the
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
effect of uh utilization of evidence
 
01:36:06.990 --> 01:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
derived from A system that was not
 
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
compliant with the state of New
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's uh would be would not be
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
admissible as opposed to the statement
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
that's in the current Amendment um which
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
actually uh the in the the language in
 
01:36:17.709 --> 01:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
the current amendment is a little bit
 
01:36:19.149 --> 01:36:19.159 align:start position:0%
more agreeable which says the
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
utilization of the the state's own
 
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
utilization of facial recognition so I I
 
01:36:28.030 --> 01:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
think that's the difference yes and I'm
 
01:36:30.189 --> 01:36:30.199 align:start position:0%
sorry I do see that in the bill now and
 
01:36:33.070 --> 01:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment I didn't earlier thank you
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative Schmidt had a
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair um
 
01:36:41.229 --> 01:36:41.239 align:start position:0%
Captain thank you very much for being
 
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
here today uh one of the concerns that
 
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
was raised especially by uh
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative burch's testimony was the
 
01:36:52.669 --> 01:36:52.679 align:start position:0%
the issue of uh child sex sexual
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
predators uh and that uh that if we were
 
01:37:00.629 --> 01:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
to uh pass the bill as amended the with
 
01:37:03.550 --> 01:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment that is to say uh
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
that this would uh you know handicap
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
police and actually act as a magnet for
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh for SE child sexual Prejudice who are
 
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
using online resources uh who are mobile
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
and and who are willing to move uh and
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
it would it would put New Hampshire
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
especially you know in the crosshairs of
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
such criminals so can you comment on
 
01:37:36.030 --> 01:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
that aspect I can in a a general sense
 
01:37:38.189 --> 01:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
represent Schmid um and and here's what
 
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
I can tell you from my um my experience
 
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
the representative bur I listened to his
 
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
testimony very closely when he talked
 
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
about the the sexual predators and their
 
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
um their ability to keenly be aware of
 
01:37:55.149 --> 01:37:55.159 align:start position:0%
the laws in each state so uh the extent
 
01:37:59.070 --> 01:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
to which this would uh open a a portal
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
or or create a loophole or make more
 
01:38:05.149 --> 01:38:05.159 align:start position:0%
difficult the uh the investigation into
 
01:38:08.189 --> 01:38:08.199 align:start position:0%
sexual predators um you know I can see
 
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
certainly where he's coming from on that
 
01:38:11.589 --> 01:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
and I I have some level of agreement
 
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
with that as well whether or not that
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
would attract people to the state of New
 
01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's a much more difficult
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
question for me to to truly give an
 
01:38:21.310 --> 01:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
answer to but anecdotally I will tell
 
01:38:23.470 --> 01:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
you that it's been my experience that
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
individuals especially those uh who are
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
sexual offenders gravitate toward the
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
states uh that have the lightest sexual
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
offender uh requirements so I I I do
 
01:38:37.709 --> 01:38:37.719 align:start position:0%
think do I do I think it would be a mass
 
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh movement all at once upon passage of
 
01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
the bill no but I do think unfortunately
 
01:38:44.589 --> 01:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
this information is shared in the forums
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
in which they visit um and could very
 
01:38:49.870 --> 01:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
well lead to uh more Predators uh
 
01:38:51.149 --> 01:38:51.159 align:start position:0%
visiting the state of New Hampshire
 
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
based upon a notion that they believe
 
01:38:55.870 --> 01:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
that it is safer to operate within the
 
01:38:57.629 --> 01:38:57.639 align:start position:0%
uh the boundaries of the
 
01:39:00.109 --> 01:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
state thank you very much I'm I'm
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
reminded of the case of Jeffrey Curley
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you are there other
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
I see that Professor Sher wishes to
 
01:39:16.199 --> 01:39:20.030 align:start position:0%
I see that Professor Sher wishes to
speak

01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
again

01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:26.480 align:start position:0%

Sher

01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%

preface what I'm about to say with this
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh I have the utmost of respect for
 
01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
representative bur uh he and I have
 
01:40:20.589 --> 01:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
worked together on any number of bills
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh and I uh I have great respect for his
 
01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
judgment uh that said he's just wrong
 
01:40:30.910 --> 01:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
here if the police as to the sexual
 
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
offender uh uh issue uh and the the
 
01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
sexual predators issue if the police
 
01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
have a photograph or an online video of
 
01:40:46.350 --> 01:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
an individual engaging in sexual conduct
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
with somebody who may be
 
01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:51.910 align:start position:0%
with somebody who may be
underage

01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
underage
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
every judge I ever practiced in in New
 
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and all the judges I've
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
talked to and trained and all the
 
01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
students I've had who are now judges if
 
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
they had a police officer come to them
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
and say we have a picture of this sexual
 
01:41:14.310 --> 01:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
conduct occurring the the person in
 
01:41:17.790 --> 01:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
there may well be underage appears to be
 
01:41:21.070 --> 01:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
underage I'm not certain about that I
 
01:41:23.550 --> 01:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
want a search warrant to use facial
 
01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:25.070 align:start position:0%
want a search warrant to use facial
recognition

01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
recognition
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
technology uh at interpole or wherever
 
01:41:32.109 --> 01:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
every judge I have ever trained or ever
 
01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
taught or ever appeared in front of will
 
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
issue that search warrant you do not
 
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
need to be certain that the individual
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
is underage the victim is underage in
 
01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:47.639 align:start position:0%
order to get a search warrant a search
 
01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
warrant is based on probable cause it's
 
01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
not based on
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
certainty um number two um
 
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative bur said you know the
 
01:42:06.589 --> 01:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
original 499 requires uh uh the court
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
issue a warrant once after 72 hours it
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that the word warrant is
 
01:42:14.109 --> 01:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
never issued in the original never used
 
01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
in the original 499 it talks about a
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
court order it doesn't say whether
 
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
there's probable cause needed for the
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
court order Reasonable Suspicion needed
 
01:42:24.910 --> 01:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
for the court order none of that is
 
01:42:29.070 --> 01:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh uh finally I refer uh the
 
01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
committee to uh my written statement as
 
01:42:35.870 --> 01:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
to the reliability issue uh and refer uh
 
01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
very briefly back to axon corporation
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
which is the leading provider of of uh
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
devices to uh law enforcement including
 
01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
body camps it's the leading purveyor
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
body camps they have chosen under advice
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
of a independent Ethics Committee not to
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
use facial recognition technology BEC
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
with their body cams because they don't
 
01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
feel certain about it so um I uh more
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
than willing to entertain questions and
 
01:43:07.950 --> 01:43:07.960 align:start position:0%

over to lay though would it not be
 
01:43:32.430 --> 01:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
accurate description problem just say
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
that means more likely than
 
01:43:35.119 --> 01:43:36.790 align:start position:0%
that means more likely than
not

01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%

going to give you two answers yes to a
 
01:43:48.910 --> 01:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
Layman it sounds like more likely than
 
01:43:51.870 --> 01:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
not but uh the body of case law out
 
01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
there interpreting what probable cause
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
is is closer to something like I have
 
01:44:00.669 --> 01:44:00.679 align:start position:0%
reason to believe a crime may be
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
committed and if I get this search
 
01:44:05.629 --> 01:44:05.639 align:start position:0%
warrant uh I will have an opportunity to
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
figure out whether that's the case or
 
01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:10.719 align:start position:0%
not so it actually is not viewed under
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
the law as more likely than not it's
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
just I have reason to believe that there
 
01:44:19.950 --> 01:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
may be based on these hard facts that
 
01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
I've articul ated out loud I have reason
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
to believe based on these hard facts
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
there might be a crime committed so in
 
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
in representative burch's example there
 
01:44:32.350 --> 01:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
is a picture sexual conduct is or a
 
01:44:35.589 --> 01:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
video sexual conduct is occurring the K
 
01:44:37.870 --> 01:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
the victim of sure looks like they may
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
be underage or may well be underage and
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
it I've gotten this from a website that
 
01:44:47.470 --> 01:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
traffics in that kind of that kind of
 
01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
victim um give me a search warrant so
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
that I have reason to believe they're
 
01:44:54.510 --> 01:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
underage I can get a search warn in that
 
01:44:56.669 --> 01:44:56.679 align:start position:0%
case because there's all the elements of
 
01:45:00.669 --> 01:45:00.679 align:start position:0%
the crime other than some uncertainty as
 
01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
as to the age of the victim and and I'll
 
01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative Schmid you
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
have a brief
 
01:45:15.189 --> 01:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
question I have a question Madame chair
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh so Professor Sher uh the
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
element of speed uh is has been
 
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
referenced here uh and I'm wondering
 
01:45:30.910 --> 01:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
whether uh there's any additional delay
 
01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh with the amendment procedure uh Visa
 
01:45:39.589 --> 01:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
uh without uh given the given the the
 
01:45:42.189 --> 01:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
benefits of Technology uh modern
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
technology in the certainly in the 21st
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
century it is not difficult to get a
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
warrant very quickly certainly in the
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
Circ circumstance that uh that
 
01:45:54.910 --> 01:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
representative Burch indicated it's it's
 
01:45:57.709 --> 01:45:57.719 align:start position:0%
pretty easy to get a search warrant so
 
01:45:59.950 --> 01:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
the delay particularly since we're not
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
talking about an incident that is
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
occurring as we speak the delay would be
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
you know minimal less than an hour uh in
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
most circumstances in my experience in
 
01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire thank you are there other
 
01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
questions for Professor
 
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
shower great thank you thank you thank
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
you very much um for taking my testimony
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
and um I I want to um address I think
 
01:46:46.350 --> 01:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
that we're only talking right now and
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong Madam chair
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
about the amendment
 
01:46:53.189 --> 01:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the base bill but
 
01:46:56.109 --> 01:46:56.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment is also being discussed
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
because it was presented at the hearing
 
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh the first part of the hearing okay
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you that that that helps
 
01:47:08.189 --> 01:47:08.199 align:start position:0%
um I understand that there are a number
 
01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
of people who have some very very strong
 
01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
feelings about the use of facial
 
01:47:15.550 --> 01:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
recognition technology and that there
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
are a myriad of instances in which this
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
could be perceived as being wildly
 
01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and I would just like to
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
draw your attention to um back to some
 
01:47:29.709 --> 01:47:29.719 align:start position:0%
of the testimony that representative
 
01:47:32.830 --> 01:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
Burch gave and can ask the committee to
 
01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:33.950 align:start position:0%
Burch gave and can ask the committee to
please

01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
consider um if there is a will to go
 
01:47:40.030 --> 01:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
forward with any kind of legislation
 
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
like this that you consider putting in a
 
01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:43.830 align:start position:0%
like this that you consider putting in a
carv

01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
carv
 
01:47:47.470 --> 01:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
out for the use of
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
identifying um children and seniors
 
01:47:54.109 --> 01:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
years this legislation as written and as
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
amended will actually impede the
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
identification of missing persons who
 
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
are subject to both Amber Alerts and
 
01:48:06.669 --> 01:48:06.679 align:start position:0%
silver alerts um and we have had a
 
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
number of those here in New Hampshire
 
01:48:13.390 --> 01:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
and I would submit to you that while
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
Professor Sher seems incredibly
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
confident to the point of cavalier in
 
01:48:22.109 --> 01:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
his ability to secure search warrants
 
01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
time is of the essence when searching
 
01:48:27.189 --> 01:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
for a missing child when searching for a
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
missing senior representative Al Schuler
 
01:48:32.669 --> 01:48:32.679 align:start position:0%
please do not insult the other
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
continue my apologies madam chair I will
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
um so I will I will say that in my
 
01:48:58.990 --> 01:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
opinion uh Professor Sher is wrong and
 
01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
um the acquisition of a search warrant
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
to use um cameras while searching for a
 
01:49:09.870 --> 01:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
missing child through an Amber Alert
 
01:49:12.669 --> 01:49:12.679 align:start position:0%
missing senior through a silver alert
 
01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
and a child um who is in transit with um
 
01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
with somebody who is subject to um an
 
01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
alert through the national Center for
 
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
missing and exploiting CH exploited
 
01:49:29.149 --> 01:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
children we know that in those three
 
01:49:32.750 --> 01:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
instances time is of the essence and
 
01:49:36.510 --> 01:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully I ask you to make sure that
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
there is a carve out if the committee
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
insists on going forward with this for
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
um for those instances um our internet
 
01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
crimes against children task force needs
 
01:49:54.910 --> 01:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
that our um Child Abuse Prevention
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
Advocates request that and our children
 
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
who go missing in New Hampshire need
 
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
that um and I thank you for your time
 
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:15.669 --> 01:50:15.679 align:start position:0%
aler uh representative sitech carve out
 
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:21.390 --> 01:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
sense uh thank you thank you very much
 
01:50:25.709 --> 01:50:25.719 align:start position:0%
representative scitec um when this bill
 
01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
first came around uh when this bill came
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
around in the last session it um was
 
01:50:36.990 --> 01:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
amended to include a carve out or an
 
01:50:41.430 --> 01:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
exception for the use um in the cases of
 
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
child U missing children um and child
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
exploitation I'm respectfully requesting
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
that we also add in silver alerts um
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
because you know that is of a con that
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
is of a new concern um and that be added
 
01:51:00.750 --> 01:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
into um the legislation should this
 
01:51:02.430 --> 01:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
legislation go
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
forward be assured my intention is that
 
01:51:07.149 --> 01:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
I don't think this legislation should go
 
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
forward at all um but if it does
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
respectfully put in a an exception for
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
the use in those
 
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
instances thank you representative algro
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
and then repres of SM quick question for
 
01:51:25.629 --> 01:51:25.639 align:start position:0%
Amber Alerts and silver alerts should we
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
build in a carve out uh allowing police
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
to kick in the door of an office without
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
a warrant to gain information in a
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
hurry I I don't understand the
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
connection I'm sorry question repres
 
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
please don't argue with the witness no
 
01:51:44.589 --> 01:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm actually asking let me I'll try
 
01:51:47.069 --> 01:51:47.079 align:start position:0%
to rephrase it thank you uh we have the
 
01:51:49.950 --> 01:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
same situation if a child was missing or
 
01:51:53.950 --> 01:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
or a u an elder is missing uh and the
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
police believe the law enforcement
 
01:51:58.189 --> 01:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
believes that there's information in
 
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
someone's office uh that they need in a
 
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
hurry and so my question is should we
 
01:52:10.030 --> 01:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
um should we allow violations of the
 
01:52:12.109 --> 01:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
fourth uh Amendment under those
 
01:52:15.629 --> 01:52:15.639 align:start position:0%
circumstances as well I hope I ask that
 
01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
in a a better
 
01:52:20.790 --> 01:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
format um well I
 
01:52:23.310 --> 01:52:23.320 align:start position:0%
specifically and I'm sorry who am I
 
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.360 align:start position:0%

of people who are in the
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
lob um uh it's it's my understanding

01:52:39.790 --> 01:52:39.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:42.750 --> 01:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
specifically House Bill 499 and House
 
01:52:47.229 --> 01:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
Bill 499 um as amended um the the
 
01:52:50.790 --> 01:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
instance of kicking indoors or
 
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
move moving into physical spaces is
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
actually not addressed and this bill
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
specifically addresses the use of facial
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
recognition technology to identify
 
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
people um and my request is that when
 
01:53:09.510 --> 01:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
we're looking to identify children um
 
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
who are being are exploited children who
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
are missing seniors who are missing that
 
01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
if we can make that an easier task to do
 
01:53:23.229 --> 01:53:23.239 align:start position:0%
so that we can protect the public safety
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
for those people that we allow for that
 
01:53:29.229 --> 01:53:29.239 align:start position:0%
to that technology to be used and not
 
01:53:32.669 --> 01:53:32.679 align:start position:0%
have New Hampshire become um kind of a
 
01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
technological dead zone for being able
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
to use that technology I certainly would
 
01:53:42.270 --> 01:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
be um distressed to have a child cross
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
through the tolls at Route 95 who is who
 
01:53:48.910 --> 01:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
has been um kidnapped and is being
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
exploited and is the subject of an amber
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
alert um and be able to be transported
 
01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
all around the state and we can't we
 
01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
can't identify them because you know
 
01:54:01.950 --> 01:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
we're working with a
 
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
72-hour probable Co cause search warrant
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
um when we might be able to see them at
 
01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
A T at a toll um we might be able to see
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
them at a gas station um so when we're
 
01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:16.719 align:start position:0%
looking for senior citizens who
 
01:54:20.109 --> 01:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
have you know who are in danger and are
 
01:54:22.229 --> 01:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
the subject of silver alerts I'd like to
 
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
see all tools be able to be used to get
 
01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
them home safe thank you thank you rep
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
Schmidt do you have a brief question I
 
01:54:35.709 --> 01:54:35.719 align:start position:0%
do thank you madam chair uh so
 
01:54:38.109 --> 01:54:38.119 align:start position:0%
representative aler uh do you have
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
proposed language or an amendment to uh
 
01:54:43.390 --> 01:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
effectuate the carat you've
 
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
referenced um I would be happy to
 
01:54:47.550 --> 01:54:47.560 align:start position:0%
provide that to you representative
 
01:54:49.629 --> 01:54:49.639 align:start position:0%
Schmidt I only became aware of the amend
 
01:54:54.750 --> 01:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
m m um a short while ago so um I did not
 
01:54:57.910 --> 01:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
realize I am coming to you on the quick
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
but I would be happy to provide that
 
01:55:02.430 --> 01:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
carve out if that is something that you
 
01:55:04.229 --> 01:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
would be interested in
 
01:55:06.629 --> 01:55:06.639 align:start position:0%
proposing thank you very much you're
 
01:55:09.149 --> 01:55:09.159 align:start position:0%
welcome is there anyone else who wish
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
other questions from represent all
 
01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
Scher seeing none thank you very much is
 
01:55:16.159 --> 01:55:17.229 align:start position:0%
Scher seeing none thank you very much is
there

01:55:17.229 --> 01:55:17.239 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:36.109 --> 01:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:48.589 --> 01:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:48.599 --> 01:55:50.350 align:start position:0%
 
Connelly

01:55:50.350 --> 01:55:50.360 align:start position:0%
Connelly
 
01:55:57.550 --> 01:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:59.950 --> 01:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
yourself hello Madam chair can you hear
 
01:56:04.069 --> 01:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
me yes thank you apologies took a little
 
01:56:07.229 --> 01:56:07.239 align:start position:0%
bit to transfer into the Matrix there uh
 
01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:09.679 align:start position:0%
so uh for the record my name is Ross
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
Connelly I'm I'm the deputy state
 
01:56:13.069 --> 01:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
director for Americans for Prosperity
 
01:56:15.629 --> 01:56:15.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'm here to voice our
 
01:56:17.669 --> 01:56:17.679 align:start position:0%
support for HB
 
01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
499 uh I'll be pretty brief here we
 
01:56:23.229 --> 01:56:23.239 align:start position:0%
believe that uh fed facial recognition
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
technology as has been pointed out can
 
01:56:28.910 --> 01:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
be a powerful tool to identify suspects
 
01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
find missing persons and solve crimes
 
01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
but in a number of cases the technology
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
has been used improperly by law
 
01:56:37.470 --> 01:56:37.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement and other
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions like being used as a sole
 
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
rationale for an arrest or without
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
meaningful human review uh this
 
01:56:47.550 --> 01:56:47.560 align:start position:0%
technology also raises the possibility
 
01:56:50.629 --> 01:56:50.639 align:start position:0%
of creating a panopticon of continuous
 
01:56:53.109 --> 01:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
surveillance of individuals or groups in
 
01:56:56.510 --> 01:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
public spaces and HB 499 strikes the
 
01:56:58.870 --> 01:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
right regulatory balance by allowing
 
01:57:01.629 --> 01:57:01.639 align:start position:0%
state law enforcement to access this
 
01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:04.360 align:start position:0%
emerging technology but it requires them
 
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
to receive a court order before they
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
engage in ongoing surveillance which has
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
been pointed out is a Time greater than
 
01:57:15.030 --> 01:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
72 hours uh this the legislation also
 
01:57:16.990 --> 01:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
allows law enforcement to use this
 
01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
technology if there are emerging
 
01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:20.750 align:start position:0%
technology if there are emerging
emergency

01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh which is a natural
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
extension of existing evidentiary common
 
01:57:28.430 --> 01:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
law uh which I believe would address
 
01:57:30.109 --> 01:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns from uh
 
01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
representative Al Schiller uh an HB 499
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
would be an important first step in and
 
01:57:39.790 --> 01:57:39.800 align:start position:0%
I'll point out first step in creating a
 
01:57:43.470 --> 01:57:43.480 align:start position:0%
a proper guard rails of overuse of this
 
01:57:46.390 --> 01:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
technology uh there is more to be done
 
01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
obviously on this issue uh with with any
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
new techn technology state and local law
 
01:57:53.709 --> 01:57:53.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement should create and publish
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines for how they should use this
 
01:57:58.229 --> 01:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
technology and circumstances not
 
01:58:00.990 --> 01:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
considered by this legislation to ensure
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's non-discriminatory
 
01:58:06.669 --> 01:58:06.679 align:start position:0%
and absolutely not the sole basis uh for
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
arrest so for those reasons we urge the
 
01:58:13.629 --> 01:58:13.639 align:start position:0%
committee to move HB 499 out to pass and
 
01:58:15.790 --> 01:58:15.800 align:start position:0%
I I'd be happy to take any questions if
 
01:58:18.189 --> 01:58:18.199 align:start position:0%
there are any thank you representative
 
01:58:21.069 --> 01:58:21.079 align:start position:0%
leus uh um so are you speaking on the
 
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
bill as originally introduced on the
 
01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
amendment or if on the bill what's your
 
01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
view on the
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
amendment uh so I I I thank you for the
 
01:58:32.069 --> 01:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
question representative uh I I have not
 
01:58:35.069 --> 01:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
seen the full text of the amendment um
 
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
from what I can tell uh we we wouldn't
 
01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
be opposed to the amendment certainly um
 
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
and uh but we do support the bill as it
 
01:58:46.990 --> 01:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
as it's written as well so uh you know
 
01:58:49.550 --> 01:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for is creating those
 
01:58:51.550 --> 01:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
those guidelines and some restrictions
 
01:58:54.910 --> 01:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
on overuse of this technology uh and we
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
think the the bill as written takes a
 
01:58:59.709 --> 01:58:59.719 align:start position:0%
great first step uh the amendment would
 
01:59:03.310 --> 01:59:03.320 align:start position:0%
would create uh some some e even more
 
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
stringent uh guard rails for it and and
 
01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
we certainly support that as well um but
 
01:59:12.310 --> 01:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know either way it's it's a good
 
01:59:15.870 --> 01:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
first step towards uh reigning in this
 
01:59:18.990 --> 01:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
technology thank you are there other
 
01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none is there anyone
 
01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
else who wishes to testify thank you
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
time seeing none in that case I will
 
01:59:38.550 --> 01:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
 
01:59:43.550 --> 01:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
499 the committee should know that there
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
was an opening for next Friday and so I
 
01:59:48.750 --> 01:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
have scheduled an exact session for
 
01:59:50.069 --> 01:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
house bill Bill
 
01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
499 and House Bill
 
01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
211 and also any other bills we may get
 
01:59:58.830 --> 01:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
to which is going to include most of the
 
02:00:01.189 --> 02:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
ones we we I thought we would have time
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
for today so on that's on Friday the
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:14.629 --> 02:00:14.639 align:start position:0%
o'clock that will give us time to talk
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
about and think about these
 
02:00:19.950 --> 02:00:19.960 align:start position:0%
bills um
 
02:00:24.910 --> 02:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
the hearing for 5:44 resumes at
 
02:00:28.990 --> 02:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
1:30 so I would like to with your
 
02:00:32.069 --> 02:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
permission exec aail or to before we go
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
lunch representative scitec you're
 
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
stepping out for a moment that's
 
02:00:47.069 --> 02:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
fine M chair I'd like to um make a
 
02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
motion to um up I to pass on the
 
02:00:53.229 --> 02:00:53.239 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill
 
02:01:02.189 --> 02:01:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry madam chair what was the
 
02:01:08.189 --> 02:01:08.199 align:start position:0%
motion I just missed it I'm sorry ought
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:24.229 align:start position:0%
 
034

02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your motion
 
02:01:28.109 --> 02:01:28.119 align:start position:0%

basically um ratifies the um amendments
 
02:01:38.589 --> 02:01:38.599 align:start position:0%
to the building codes that have occurred
 
02:01:40.589 --> 02:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
since the last
 
02:01:43.790 --> 02:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
um for a while and the
 
02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:45.350 align:start position:0%
um for a while and the
amendment

02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:01:48.510 --> 02:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
um essentially just includes the some of
 
02:01:50.430 --> 02:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
the ones that weren't in the original
 
02:01:52.830 --> 02:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
bill that have happened since
 
02:01:55.149 --> 02:01:55.159 align:start position:0%
then I sort of said that a little
 
02:01:57.550 --> 02:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
backwards I hope people
 
02:01:59.950 --> 02:01:59.960 align:start position:0%

02:02:13.830 --> 02:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
any roll calls if
 
02:02:16.910 --> 02:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
necessary we get that
 
02:02:21.990 --> 02:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
far sorry uh the motion I'd like to
 
02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
speak to my second and say that the
 
02:02:26.910 --> 02:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
amendment was a request of the Fire
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
Marshall and it includes things like
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
amending the fire code
 
02:02:36.669 --> 02:02:36.679 align:start position:0%
to enforce the new that um sprinklers
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
are not required in one or two one or
 
02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
two family houses that the historic
 
02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:45.950 align:start position:0%
two family houses that the historic
houses

02:02:45.950 --> 02:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
houses
 
02:02:48.629 --> 02:02:48.639 align:start position:0%
um code should be used rather than the
 
02:02:52.109 --> 02:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
basic um new house code for a lot of the
 
02:02:55.589 --> 02:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
fire code issues and and in other ways
 
02:02:58.109 --> 02:02:58.119 align:start position:0%
makes the fire code more appropriate for
 
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it was passed by the board
 
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
of Fire
 
02:03:08.270 --> 02:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
Control in 19 sometime it was rep passed
 
02:03:11.910 --> 02:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
in December of 2020 because
 
02:03:15.390 --> 02:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
it the fire code amendments expire if
 
02:03:19.149 --> 02:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
not authorized by the legislature so we
 
02:03:20.229 --> 02:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
are I
 
02:03:23.470 --> 02:03:23.480 align:start position:0%
added um I added these after the bill
 
02:03:25.629 --> 02:03:25.639 align:start position:0%
was drafted and
 
02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:38.520 align:start position:0%

House Bill 72 um includes the
 
02:06:24.669 --> 02:06:24.679 align:start position:0%
ratification of amendments that have
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
been made by state building codes and
 
02:06:29.229 --> 02:06:29.239 align:start position:0%
State Fire codes this is a bill that
 
02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
passed last year and um did not make it
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
through the house I mean made it through
 
02:06:36.549 --> 02:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
the house but didn't make it back um
 
02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
based on an Omnibus Bill so and I think
 
02:06:42.350 --> 02:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
that this bill will bring New Hampshire
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
up to um current code in
 
02:06:49.549 --> 02:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
law thank you
 
02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
anyone represent lus yeah either for
 
02:06:55.990 --> 02:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative grer or for you just give
 
02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
me some idea the nature of the changes
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
this uh I mentioned the
 
02:07:10.149 --> 02:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:15.149 --> 02:07:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:19.229 --> 02:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
speaking actually get the vaccine that's
 
02:07:20.589 --> 02:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
I don't know who's
 
02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:28.549 --> 02:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
either yes if you're not speaking keep
 
02:07:32.589 --> 02:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
yourself muted the building code changes
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
include things like alternate methods of
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh building structures and and
 
02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
reinforcing floors for fireproofing or
 
02:07:46.470 --> 02:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
actually access to
 
02:07:50.750 --> 02:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
firemen uh they limit some of the
 
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
extremes of the energy code to address
 
02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have a lot of houses
 
02:07:58.830 --> 02:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
that don't have mechanical
 
02:08:00.910 --> 02:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
ventilation uh those are the ones I
 
02:08:04.189 --> 02:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
remember but there are other
 
02:08:07.229 --> 02:08:07.239 align:start position:0%
uh yeah but most of them are
 
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
simplifications or cost savings for
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
building okay and they've been
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
exhaustively fought over by the building
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
code review board which includes the
 
02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
Architects the office of and planning
 
02:08:24.270 --> 02:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:27.229 --> 02:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
etc I agree with that it also involves
 
02:08:27.239 --> 02:08:28.709 align:start position:0%
etc I agree with that it also involves
thermal

02:08:28.709 --> 02:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
thermal
 
02:08:31.229 --> 02:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
values and
 
02:08:33.950 --> 02:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
um having to do with the construction of
 
02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
homes that are built in this this
 
02:08:40.950 --> 02:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
certain climate zone and um relative to
 
02:08:43.229 --> 02:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
um our
 
02:08:47.229 --> 02:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
values the yes the other thing is that
 
02:08:50.109 --> 02:08:50.119 align:start position:0%
these are changes to the
 
02:08:52.669 --> 02:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
2015 building code which is what the
 
02:08:55.589 --> 02:08:55.599 align:start position:0%
state is at we have not yet adopted the
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
2018 building code which is
 
02:09:03.030 --> 02:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
the C version more or less but we will
 
02:09:05.950 --> 02:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
probably consider doing so next year
 
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
when it's uh when the bugs have shaken
 
02:09:11.790 --> 02:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
out if I might add I think this
 
02:09:13.950 --> 02:09:13.960 align:start position:0%
committee discussed that and the
 
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
agreement was that we would adopt the
 
02:09:18.589 --> 02:09:18.599 align:start position:0%
codes two to three years after the been
 
02:09:18.599 --> 02:09:19.350 align:start position:0%
codes two to three years after the been
in

02:09:19.350 --> 02:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
effect yes there's always some
 
02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
U errors and omissions in the code that
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:38.510 --> 02:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
speak that case U the motion is ought to
 
02:09:41.549 --> 02:09:41.559 align:start position:0%
pass with Amendment on House Bill 72 and
 
02:09:44.589 --> 02:09:44.599 align:start position:0%

02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
3 that was the bill relative to um
 
02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
Administration by the retirement system
 
02:12:01.629 --> 02:12:01.639 align:start position:0%

second when did we hear that that was
 
02:12:11.830 --> 02:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
the issue as to um whose deductions
 
02:12:14.470 --> 02:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
should be taken out of a retiree's
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
benefits first the retirement system or
 
02:12:22.189 --> 02:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
Das uh after hearing the testimony and
 
02:12:26.069 --> 02:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
examining um the question it's my
 
02:12:28.589 --> 02:12:28.599 align:start position:0%
feeling that uh the position of the
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
retirement system should come first in
 
02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:39.149 --> 02:12:39.159 align:start position:0%
deductions all right uh representative
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
Schultz do you wish to speak to your a
 
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
second no I think rep Shu did it very
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
well okay do that anyone else wish to
 
02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
speak representative Pearson you were
 
02:12:54.589 --> 02:12:54.599 align:start position:0%
saying no I uh no I think that she did a
 
02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
excellent job that's uh I
 
02:13:02.069 --> 02:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
agree um I actually was convinced by Das
 
02:13:04.430 --> 02:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
that they had the better case but I've
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
asked them to provide us with an
 
02:13:08.270 --> 02:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that say presents their case
 
02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
and they
 
02:13:13.149 --> 02:13:13.159 align:start position:0%
haven't so that's a concern does anyone
 
02:13:16.350 --> 02:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
else have a a
 
02:13:28.669 --> 02:13:28.679 align:start position:0%

02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
important thing is that we settle the

sponsor um we when we heard the bill we

between what we saw in the bill and what
 
02:16:08.830 --> 02:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
the sponsor thought it said and also the

02:20:13.469 --> 02:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
the chair is it not true that uh if the

02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
subst stantial changes that he can
 
02:20:22.590 --> 02:20:22.600 align:start position:0%

clarification as long or present it to
 
02:20:34.990 --> 02:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate to start there but it's uh
 
02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
the things that he that need to be
 
02:20:39.270 --> 02:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
addressed would make that bill
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:52.950 --> 02:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:55.670 --> 02:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
else well in that case let's break for
 
02:20:59.349 --> 02:20:59.359 align:start position:0%

02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%

lunch break for lunch we will resume
 
02:21:09.910 --> 02:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
back here at 1:30 to continue the
 
02:21:11.790 --> 02:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
02:21:14.630 --> 02:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
544 I think there's something like 26
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
people who wanted to wanted to sign up
 
02:21:18.030 --> 02:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
02:21:20.590 --> 02:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
so I would suggest to keep the questions
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
to a
 
02:21:24.190 --> 02:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
minimum someone else will probably come
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
along later and answer the questions
 
02:21:29.870 --> 02:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
also the first half of this hearing was
 
02:21:33.190 --> 02:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
a little bit intense and somewhat
 
02:21:35.550 --> 02:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
confrontational which may be okay when
 
02:21:39.070 --> 02:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
you're talking to the sponsor but these
 
02:21:42.270 --> 02:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
are all me members of the public so
 
02:21:44.670 --> 02:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
please let them Express their opinions
 
02:21:46.750 --> 02:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
however wrong they are and not argue
 
02:21:49.110 --> 02:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
with them
 
02:21:52.190 --> 02:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
yes what's
 
02:21:55.309 --> 02:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
that uh that's a very good question I
 
02:21:57.349 --> 02:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
will think about I'll announce it before
 
02:21:59.830 --> 02:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
we start the hearing because some people
 
02:22:03.389 --> 02:22:03.399 align:start position:0%
tend to uh drag on what was the question
 
02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I couldn't hear him whether we
 
02:22:06.790 --> 02:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
should limit the amount of time each
 
02:22:10.349 --> 02:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
person speaks okay yeah I think that's
 
02:22:10.359 --> 02:22:11.309 align:start position:0%
person speaks okay yeah I think that's
worth

02:22:11.309 --> 02:22:11.319 align:start position:0%
worth
 
02:22:14.950 --> 02:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
considering okay I I am considering even
 
02:22:18.469 --> 02:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
as we speak all right in that case don't
 
02:22:22.990 --> 02:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:27.070 --> 02:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
yeser that is Rich so get somebody's
 
02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
attention even if you're gabbling them
 
02:22:34.510 --> 02:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
down so we will announce the time limit
 
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
early uh thank you all and we will see
 
02:22:41.469 --> 02:22:41.479 align:start position:0%
you back here and the hearing will open
 
02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:47.790 --> 02:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
sharp I think is a
 
02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not the only one that goes
 
02:22:54.190 --> 02:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
on it's possible them and then right
 
02:22:56.190 --> 02:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
away I think problem is if they're still
 
02:22:58.429 --> 02:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
talking they can't hear you but if
 
02:22:58.439 --> 02:23:16.070 align:start position:0%
talking they can't hear you but if
they're

02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:16.080 --> 03:25:54.469 align:start position:0%
 
m

03:25:54.469 --> 03:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:56.110 --> 03:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
I just
 
03:26:10.389 --> 03:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:10.399 --> 03:30:08.750 align:start position:0%
 
now

03:30:08.750 --> 03:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:10.710 --> 03:30:10.720 align:start position:0%

03:31:36.830 --> 03:31:36.840 align:start position:0%

people here wishing to testify I would
 
03:32:43.790 --> 03:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
like we're going to try and limit the
 
03:32:46.950 --> 03:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
amount of time we give to each person so
 
03:32:49.870 --> 03:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
that every person will have a chance to
 
03:32:53.269 --> 03:32:53.279 align:start position:0%

03:32:59.389 --> 03:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
cut you short if
 
03:33:02.389 --> 03:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
necessary in in uh in support of that I
 
03:33:04.790 --> 03:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
will mention that it has been it's a
 
03:33:06.710 --> 03:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
well-known fact that if you've been
 
03:33:09.469 --> 03:33:09.479 align:start position:0%

03:33:11.429 --> 03:33:11.439 align:start position:0%

I represent straford County District Six
 
03:35:02.710 --> 03:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
which is the towns of Durham and Madbury
 
03:35:05.229 --> 03:35:05.239 align:start position:0%
so Durham is a home of un8 so this is
 
03:35:07.229 --> 03:35:07.239 align:start position:0%
particularly large problem if this bill
 
03:35:09.710 --> 03:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
was passed for a university given that
 
03:35:11.229 --> 03:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
frankly there's a lot of things in there
 
03:35:13.790 --> 03:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
they're inimical to its values and also
 
03:35:16.750 --> 03:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
just playing false but anyway um I'm
 
03:35:19.269 --> 03:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
opposed HB 544 for many reasons main to
 
03:35:21.070 --> 03:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
being the fact is racist and anti-free
 
03:35:23.309 --> 03:35:23.319 align:start position:0%
speech Yes I did say this is a racist
 
03:35:26.229 --> 03:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
Bill and yes I am virtue signaling but I
 
03:35:27.670 --> 03:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
have the right to Virtue signal it's
 
03:35:29.750 --> 03:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
still a free country
 
03:35:32.750 --> 03:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
um anur sponsors themselves like well
 
03:35:34.150 --> 03:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
like just about anybody F were
 
03:35:36.309 --> 03:35:36.319 align:start position:0%
themselves virtue signaling um normally
 
03:35:37.790 --> 03:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
I lap this bill off but it has to be
 
03:35:40.870 --> 03:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
taken serious you will not impune the
 
03:35:42.630 --> 03:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
motives of
 
03:35:45.590 --> 03:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
anyone to what you believe and what you
 
03:35:48.910 --> 03:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
know but you may not fault or anyone
 
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you I would uh well
 
03:35:53.630 --> 03:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
I would just say I this still would have
 
03:35:55.550 --> 03:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
racist effect so I'll leave it at that
 
03:35:57.550 --> 03:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
and I admit that I am virtue signally in
 
03:35:59.710 --> 03:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
case anybody listening wants to impune
 
03:36:02.269 --> 03:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
my motives um I'd laugh this bill off
 
03:36:04.830 --> 03:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
but given you know who majority leaders
 
03:36:07.269 --> 03:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
at co-sponsor um we have to take it
 
03:36:11.349 --> 03:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
seriously um certainly uh racism sexism
 
03:36:13.590 --> 03:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
are no laughing matter racism is theft
 
03:36:15.389 --> 03:36:15.399 align:start position:0%
sexism is also theft they don't just
 
03:36:17.070 --> 03:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
steal people's dignity but they even
 
03:36:18.389 --> 03:36:18.399 align:start position:0%
steal their money because women of
 
03:36:20.070 --> 03:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
minorities are paid less on the average
 
03:36:23.189 --> 03:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
and white males for doing the same work
 
03:36:26.309 --> 03:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
um I I was brought up into Faith which
 
03:36:28.750 --> 03:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
teaches Racial equality
 
03:36:31.309 --> 03:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
uh which I prompted by a comment I heard
 
03:36:32.269 --> 03:36:32.279 align:start position:0%
last week because gu I don't want to
 
03:36:35.429 --> 03:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
impune his motives but um perhaps many
 
03:36:36.630 --> 03:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
the committee some of committee may have
 
03:36:37.990 --> 03:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
heard of it or even belong to it it's a
 
03:36:40.469 --> 03:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
Roman Catholic Church um I never went
 
03:36:42.070 --> 03:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
went to perio school but I did graduate
 
03:36:43.550 --> 03:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
from Christian High School which also
 
03:36:45.269 --> 03:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
taught Racial equality as well as gender
 
03:36:46.950 --> 03:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
equality that' be the northv Mount
 
03:36:50.510 --> 03:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
Herman school so certainly it's possible
 
03:36:52.030 --> 03:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think I'm a racist I hope I'm
 
03:36:54.309 --> 03:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
not I've done unkind things said and
 
03:36:55.910 --> 03:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
done unkind things which I now know to
 
03:36:58.790 --> 03:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
be wrong but um it's certainly possible
 
03:37:00.830 --> 03:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
for me racist both my church community
 
03:37:02.710 --> 03:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
and my school Community both had and
 
03:37:05.269 --> 03:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
still have racist within their ranks so
 
03:37:07.790 --> 03:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh my high school is in another state it
 
03:37:09.269 --> 03:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
probably did a little of any business
 
03:37:10.950 --> 03:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
with the state of New Hampshire I
 
03:37:12.550 --> 03:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
haven't checked transparency to go to
 
03:37:15.189 --> 03:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
see if that's true but I I doubt it does
 
03:37:17.309 --> 03:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
although if there are similar schools
 
03:37:18.830 --> 03:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire do do business
 
03:37:20.429 --> 03:37:20.439 align:start position:0%
with state of Hampshire the dasis of
 
03:37:22.550 --> 03:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester does lots of business with
 
03:37:24.469 --> 03:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
the state they would do even more if
 
03:37:27.309 --> 03:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
certain bills are passed which are not
 
03:37:28.590 --> 03:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
passing this year they do lots of
 
03:37:30.950 --> 03:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
business with the state and I'd say most
 
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
probably all of the stipulation HB 544
 
03:37:35.469 --> 03:37:35.479 align:start position:0%
are incompatible with the church's value
 
03:37:38.189 --> 03:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
in fact I think uh I think the
 
03:37:40.910 --> 03:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
stipulations HB 54 are incompatible the
 
03:37:42.550 --> 03:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
values of just about every institution
 
03:37:43.830 --> 03:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire including
 
03:37:46.910 --> 03:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
the business community and um also as I
 
03:37:49.870 --> 03:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
said and I guess and um I guess also
 
03:37:51.870 --> 03:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
aside the fact that there's lots of
 
03:37:53.429 --> 03:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
incorrect facts here in the beginning of
 
03:37:56.229 --> 03:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
the bill um and it's also probably
 
03:37:58.389 --> 03:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
totally unenforceable like it because
 
03:38:01.469 --> 03:38:01.479 align:start position:0%
there's really no way for the state to
 
03:38:04.510 --> 03:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
know what what sort of interal Personnel
 
03:38:07.990 --> 03:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
practices um any even a nonprofit or
 
03:38:09.670 --> 03:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
Corporation or even a business that they
 
03:38:12.229 --> 03:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
do with and would like and they this
 
03:38:14.309 --> 03:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
would force them to medal in the Affairs
 
03:38:16.950 --> 03:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
at just about every every institution
 
03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
including private businesses that has
 
03:38:19.990 --> 03:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
any contact with state government
 
03:38:21.910 --> 03:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
whatsoever so it's uh
 
03:38:24.150 --> 03:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
it's the lck the other hand there's also
 
03:38:26.510 --> 03:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
no enforcement mechanism there's no fine
 
03:38:29.710 --> 03:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
or anything so anyway this is a uh very
 
03:38:31.750 --> 03:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
bad Bill so I'm sure I'm not the only
 
03:38:33.229 --> 03:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
person who going to say that so I would
 
03:38:37.630 --> 03:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
like uh I would urge you to uh itl it as
 
03:38:39.630 --> 03:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
soon as you know itl it as soon as
 
03:38:41.630 --> 03:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
possible so thank you if you have to
 
03:38:43.349 --> 03:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
take any questions should anyone have
 
03:38:45.630 --> 03:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
them thank you are there questions for
 
03:38:45.640 --> 03:38:49.030 align:start position:0%
them thank you are there questions for
representative

03:38:49.030 --> 03:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:52.910 --> 03:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hy seeing none I call Jim
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:09.239 --> 03:39:21.070 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:39:21.070 --> 03:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:24.269 --> 03:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
Mr Lindley hello sorry I was uh figuring
 
03:39:26.550 --> 03:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
out zoom on my phone for the first time
 
03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
oh okay I unfortunately I'm joining you
 
03:39:31.590 --> 03:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
from a hotel in Los Angeles today my
 
03:39:33.670 --> 03:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
name is James Lindsay I
 
03:39:37.150 --> 03:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
am um an expert in critical race theory
 
03:39:39.110 --> 03:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
in fact I'm one of the very few experts
 
03:39:40.870 --> 03:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
in critical race theory that does not
 
03:39:43.550 --> 03:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
subscribe to the ideology underlying
 
03:39:45.349 --> 03:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
critical race Theory and I wanted to
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
testify in support of this bill I think
 
03:39:50.429 --> 03:39:50.439 align:start position:0%
this bill is a crucial maneuver for
 
03:39:52.469 --> 03:39:52.479 align:start position:0%
essentially every state especially since
 
03:39:54.110 --> 03:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
there was an executive order of this
 
03:39:56.229 --> 03:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
type federally that then was rescinded
 
03:39:58.389 --> 03:39:58.399 align:start position:0%
by the current sitting president I want
 
03:40:00.229 --> 03:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
to kind of start my testimony I'll try
 
03:40:02.910 --> 03:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
to stay brief by saying that I reive
 
03:40:04.990 --> 03:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
thousands of messages from people all
 
03:40:07.990 --> 03:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
over the country because I am recognized
 
03:40:10.750 --> 03:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
as a kind of World level expert in
 
03:40:13.429 --> 03:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
critical race Theory from parents of
 
03:40:16.110 --> 03:40:16.120 align:start position:0%
students in schools people in workplaces
 
03:40:19.349 --> 03:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
begging me for solutions that they can
 
03:40:21.150 --> 03:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
bring to their workplaces to their
 
03:40:23.469 --> 03:40:23.479 align:start position:0%
children's schools to try to deal with
 
03:40:24.990 --> 03:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
the problems that follow from this
 
03:40:26.670 --> 03:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
ideology a lot of people don't
 
03:40:28.349 --> 03:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
understand critical race Theory and we
 
03:40:29.950 --> 03:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
can talk about that briefly in a moment
 
03:40:31.990 --> 03:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
but I want to talk about the bill itself
 
03:40:33.469 --> 03:40:33.479 align:start position:0%
first as it's modeled after the
 
03:40:35.630 --> 03:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
executive order that President Trump
 
03:40:38.189 --> 03:40:38.199 align:start position:0%
issued in September and it doesn't even
 
03:40:39.790 --> 03:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
technically ban critical race Theory
 
03:40:41.469 --> 03:40:41.479 align:start position:0%
it's certainly doesn't ban the teaching
 
03:40:43.349 --> 03:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
of critical race Theory it certainly
 
03:40:46.150 --> 03:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't ban diversity or anti-racist or
 
03:40:47.710 --> 03:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
racial sensitivity training and people
 
03:40:50.510 --> 03:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
should be clear about that uh so it's
 
03:40:52.630 --> 03:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
not shutting down the ability to have
 
03:40:54.790 --> 03:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
diversity training or education or to
 
03:40:56.349 --> 03:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
cover these subjects in an academic
 
03:40:57.830 --> 03:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
manner in school so it should be made
 
03:40:59.830 --> 03:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
clear on the other hand it does ban
 
03:41:01.469 --> 03:41:01.479 align:start position:0%
things that are Central to the United
 
03:41:05.830 --> 03:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
States it bans uh or Central to the
 
03:41:06.950 --> 03:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
opposite of them is Central to the
 
03:41:08.469 --> 03:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
United States it bans racial
 
03:41:10.830 --> 03:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
scapegoating it bans racial stereotyping
 
03:41:12.910 --> 03:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
it bans racial discrimination it bans
 
03:41:16.070 --> 03:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
naming the uh country or state in this
 
03:41:19.070 --> 03:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
case as being intrinsically evil or
 
03:41:21.070 --> 03:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
racist or sexist it banss the same
 
03:41:24.149 --> 03:41:24.159 align:start position:0%
things for sex and race um racial
 
03:41:26.070 --> 03:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
scapegoating sex scapegoating racial
 
03:41:28.229 --> 03:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
stereotyping sex stereotyping and
 
03:41:31.149 --> 03:41:31.159 align:start position:0%
discrimination for both uh these are not
 
03:41:32.590 --> 03:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
things that we really want to try to
 
03:41:34.910 --> 03:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
bring back into this country we spent a
 
03:41:36.550 --> 03:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
long time getting away from them the
 
03:41:38.469 --> 03:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
ideology of critical race Theory begins
 
03:41:40.229 --> 03:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
from the first assumption that it makes
 
03:41:41.389 --> 03:41:41.399 align:start position:0%
this is written in all of their
 
03:41:43.469 --> 03:41:43.479 align:start position:0%
literature you can read it for yourself
 
03:41:45.429 --> 03:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
for example in Delgado and Stan's
 
03:41:46.950 --> 03:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
critical race Theory and introduction
 
03:41:48.510 --> 03:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
which is a standard text book in the
 
03:41:50.269 --> 03:41:50.279 align:start position:0%
subject it says that it begins from the
 
03:41:51.870 --> 03:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
assumption that racism and it would be
 
03:41:54.229 --> 03:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
parallel for sexism is the ordinary
 
03:41:56.750 --> 03:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
State of Affairs in society it is the
 
03:41:59.070 --> 03:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
normal science of society it's not an
 
03:42:01.670 --> 03:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
aberration that boils down in the name
 
03:42:04.510 --> 03:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
in the words of other Scholars to uh the
 
03:42:06.670 --> 03:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
question is no longer did racism take
 
03:42:09.309 --> 03:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
place but rather how did racism manifest
 
03:42:11.189 --> 03:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
in that situation the people who are
 
03:42:13.389 --> 03:42:13.399 align:start position:0%
equipped to find the racism that's
 
03:42:15.189 --> 03:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
apparently hidden in every possible
 
03:42:18.070 --> 03:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
situation every interaction every uh
 
03:42:20.590 --> 03:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
student teacher interaction every
 
03:42:22.630 --> 03:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
employee interaction every boss employee
 
03:42:24.710 --> 03:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
interaction every single one of those
 
03:42:26.269 --> 03:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
has racism in it the people equipped to
 
03:42:27.550 --> 03:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
find it are called critical race
 
03:42:30.269 --> 03:42:30.279 align:start position:0%
theorists what this training or what
 
03:42:32.510 --> 03:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
this this bill is supposed to ban is
 
03:42:35.469 --> 03:42:35.479 align:start position:0%
training people to think this way and
 
03:42:37.349 --> 03:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
mandating them in their workplaces and
 
03:42:39.189 --> 03:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
their schools to have to think this way
 
03:42:40.950 --> 03:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
this is a device
 
03:42:44.070 --> 03:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh dangerous way to reintroduce race
 
03:42:47.269 --> 03:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
sance and sex sance into our
 
03:42:49.950 --> 03:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
institutions it's from the thousands of
 
03:42:52.590 --> 03:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
messages I reive from from panicked
 
03:42:54.189 --> 03:42:54.199 align:start position:0%
parents and employees all over the
 
03:42:56.990 --> 03:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
country all the time uh it causes
 
03:42:59.349 --> 03:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
division it causes hostile working and
 
03:43:00.870 --> 03:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
learning environments it will set
 
03:43:04.110 --> 03:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
schools and workplaces up for um
 
03:43:06.389 --> 03:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
lawsuits where they have created
 
03:43:08.830 --> 03:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination and they have created uh
 
03:43:10.710 --> 03:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
hostile working environment
 
03:43:12.990 --> 03:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
and it's virtually certain also that it
 
03:43:15.590 --> 03:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
will open the door to the people that
 
03:43:17.349 --> 03:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
are providing these trainings from for
 
03:43:19.349 --> 03:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
being sued for providing a fraudulent
 
03:43:21.349 --> 03:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
product that does not provide uh what it
 
03:43:23.349 --> 03:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
claims to provide uh there are already
 
03:43:25.110 --> 03:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
Attorneys General in some states looking
 
03:43:27.229 --> 03:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
into how to do that because the evidence
 
03:43:29.990 --> 03:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
is on is opposite of what these training
 
03:43:32.670 --> 03:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
materials say that they do so in in that
 
03:43:34.790 --> 03:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
regard I'll wrap up I think that this is
 
03:43:37.269 --> 03:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
a very dangerous situation that we find
 
03:43:39.149 --> 03:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
ourselves in in the United States and in
 
03:43:40.189 --> 03:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire I'm sure
 
03:43:43.110 --> 03:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
right now and I think that it is in the
 
03:43:45.229 --> 03:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
best interest of every state possible to
 
03:43:46.910 --> 03:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
make a stand on this and say no we are
 
03:43:49.630 --> 03:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
not going to reintroduce race and sex
 
03:43:52.269 --> 03:43:52.279 align:start position:0%
scapegoating stereotyping discrimination
 
03:43:54.830 --> 03:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
or billing our nation or states or
 
03:43:56.469 --> 03:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
institutions as intrinsically evil
 
03:43:59.950 --> 03:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
racist or sexist so I have to support uh
 
03:44:02.309 --> 03:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
this bill as I supported um the
 
03:44:03.750 --> 03:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
executive order that President Trump
 
03:44:04.990 --> 03:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
issued in
 
03:44:07.990 --> 03:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
September thank you thank you are there
 
03:44:10.910 --> 03:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
03:44:10.920 --> 03:44:14.269 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
representative

03:44:14.269 --> 03:44:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:16.349 --> 03:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you for take thank you
 
03:44:17.910 --> 03:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:44:22.110 --> 03:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
question um historically worldwide has
 
03:44:25.630 --> 03:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
there ever been a nation that has taught
 
03:44:27.830 --> 03:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
critical race Theory to its people and
 
03:44:30.389 --> 03:44:30.399 align:start position:0%
has there and if so what were the
 
03:44:33.630 --> 03:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
effects of that if you're aware of
 
03:44:36.070 --> 03:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
any thank you for your question um the
 
03:44:38.070 --> 03:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
answer to that question is no critical
 
03:44:41.189 --> 03:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
race theory was be began in the 1970s
 
03:44:43.590 --> 03:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
but it really was developed in the 1990s
 
03:44:45.269 --> 03:44:45.279 align:start position:0%
and has only come to prominence in the
 
03:44:47.229 --> 03:44:47.239 align:start position:0%
in the last decade and it is almost a
 
03:44:49.269 --> 03:44:49.279 align:start position:0%
holy American invention it was developed
 
03:44:51.469 --> 03:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
at Harvard Law by Derek Bell and
 
03:44:54.149 --> 03:44:54.159 align:start position:0%
Kimberly khaw who you can check out the
 
03:44:55.510 --> 03:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
their scholarship if you want for
 
03:44:59.229 --> 03:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
yourself and the closest parallel to
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
what critical race Theory teaches and
 
03:45:01.910 --> 03:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
preaches it's been installed at the
 
03:45:03.710 --> 03:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
governmental level is the governor of
 
03:45:06.030 --> 03:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
South Africa you've seen if you want you
 
03:45:08.790 --> 03:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
can look up the equity task force that
 
03:45:11.110 --> 03:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
Governor Insley Washington installated
 
03:45:15.149 --> 03:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
installed in the um in about a year ago
 
03:45:16.550 --> 03:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
a little over a year ago in the state of
 
03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
Washington and they have an entire
 
03:45:21.269 --> 03:45:21.279 align:start position:0%
section in which they speak that part of
 
03:45:22.950 --> 03:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
the goal of their task force which is
 
03:45:25.309 --> 03:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
using the same ideology is to move the
 
03:45:26.550 --> 03:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
government of Washington in the
 
03:45:27.950 --> 03:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
direction of the government of South
 
03:45:29.510 --> 03:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
Africa so if you can look at what's
 
03:45:31.030 --> 03:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
going on in South Africa right now and
 
03:45:32.670 --> 03:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
think this is the direction that for my
 
03:45:34.229 --> 03:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
state this is the direction for the
 
03:45:36.389 --> 03:45:36.399 align:start position:0%
United States uh that's the closest
 
03:45:37.710 --> 03:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
parallel that you'll find the critical
 
03:45:39.870 --> 03:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
race theory is is an American invention
 
03:45:42.469 --> 03:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's quite new and uh it has not
 
03:45:46.149 --> 03:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
yet been installed uh except that it has
 
03:45:48.149 --> 03:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
kind of taken over in places in the
 
03:45:49.910 --> 03:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
United States over the past I don't know
 
03:45:52.269 --> 03:45:52.279 align:start position:0%
eight months or so pretty significantly
 
03:45:55.469 --> 03:45:55.479 align:start position:0%
leading to president Trump issuing that
 
03:45:57.990 --> 03:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
order thank you representative Schulz
 
03:46:01.870 --> 03:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
you had a question yes Madam chair um
 
03:46:03.710 --> 03:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I think
 
03:46:06.469 --> 03:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
I know who you are are you the same
 
03:46:09.750 --> 03:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
James Lindsay that is on Twitter as
 
03:46:09.760 --> 03:46:11.189 align:start position:0%
James Lindsay that is on Twitter as
conceptual

03:46:11.189 --> 03:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
conceptual
 
03:46:14.389 --> 03:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
James yes that's me okay Madam chair I
 
03:46:15.910 --> 03:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
know that this is going to be a
 
03:46:17.830 --> 03:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
difficult question but I'm asking it
 
03:46:20.750 --> 03:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
since he claims to be a national expert
 
03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
and mean no offense to the committee in
 
03:46:26.950 --> 03:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
in my question but U Mr Lindsay isn't it
 
03:46:29.670 --> 03:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
true that you have been
 
03:46:29.680 --> 03:46:31.910 align:start position:0%
true that you have been
um

03:46:31.910 --> 03:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:35.469 --> 03:46:35.479 align:start position:0%
uh I guess examined as someone who has
 
03:46:37.590 --> 03:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
issued death threats against the Jewish
 
03:46:41.070 --> 03:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
community in prominent Jewish activists
 
03:46:44.110 --> 03:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
that is not relevant to this bill and I
 
03:46:45.750 --> 03:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
mean I'll speak to that because it's
 
03:46:48.149 --> 03:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
false and my name is Dr Lindsay if you
 
03:46:51.149 --> 03:46:51.159 align:start position:0%
don't mind and you're a math professor
 
03:46:54.110 --> 03:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
correct not a sociology Professor I am a
 
03:46:56.070 --> 03:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
PhD in mathematics who's been studying
 
03:46:57.630 --> 03:46:57.640 align:start position:0%
the relevant academic literature
 
03:47:00.030 --> 03:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
full-time 16 hours a day most days of
 
03:47:02.429 --> 03:47:02.439 align:start position:0%
the week for the past three years and
 
03:47:04.510 --> 03:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
isn't it true you're affiliated with a
 
03:47:04.520 --> 03:47:06.189 align:start position:0%
isn't it true you're affiliated with a
national

03:47:06.189 --> 03:47:06.199 align:start position:0%
national
 
03:47:08.910 --> 03:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
wh representative Schultz I've muted you
 
03:47:08.920 --> 03:47:10.229 align:start position:0%
wh representative Schultz I've muted you
that

03:47:10.229 --> 03:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:47:12.110 --> 03:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
that question the answer to that
 
03:47:14.910 --> 03:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
question is also no I am affiliated with
 
03:47:17.149 --> 03:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing of the sort I can
 
03:47:18.910 --> 03:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
name the organization she's probably
 
03:47:21.670 --> 03:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
trying to uh insinuate bad things about
 
03:47:24.269 --> 03:47:24.279 align:start position:0%
to try to impune my motives but that
 
03:47:26.670 --> 03:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
organization is neither white nor
 
03:47:28.870 --> 03:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
nationalist it's fact run by a half
 
03:47:31.630 --> 03:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
Cuban and half of its board is Asian
 
03:47:35.389 --> 03:47:35.399 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to say that
 
03:47:37.910 --> 03:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
because many of the oppon or many of the
 
03:47:40.429 --> 03:47:40.439 align:start position:0%
proponents of this bill are claiming
 
03:47:43.110 --> 03:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
that those who oppose this are racist
 
03:47:46.149 --> 03:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
isn't it important to understand since
 
03:47:49.110 --> 03:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
this is all ideologically driven if
 
03:47:51.269 --> 03:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
someone is actually affiliated with a
 
03:47:52.950 --> 03:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
group that is believed to be by the
 
03:47:55.030 --> 03:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
Southern Poverty Law Center a white
 
03:47:58.149 --> 03:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
supremacist group representative Schultz
 
03:48:02.349 --> 03:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
not necessarily and I think we will not
 
03:48:03.910 --> 03:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that either the
 
03:48:05.670 --> 03:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
supporters or the proponents of this
 
03:48:09.750 --> 03:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
bill are racist and I wouldn't not make
 
03:48:12.790 --> 03:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
that assumption thank you very much may
 
03:48:14.469 --> 03:48:14.479 align:start position:0%
I have one moment to say something about
 
03:48:16.189 --> 03:48:16.199 align:start position:0%
that because it is
 
03:48:18.070 --> 03:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
Germaine it's
 
03:48:20.790 --> 03:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
Germaine uh yes so it is important to
 
03:48:22.469 --> 03:48:22.479 align:start position:0%
understand that one of the one of the
 
03:48:24.030 --> 03:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
beliefs of critical race theory is that
 
03:48:25.670 --> 03:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
all criticism of critical race Theory
 
03:48:27.469 --> 03:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
comes from a place of racism or white
 
03:48:29.469 --> 03:48:29.479 align:start position:0%
supremacy whether that's intentional or
 
03:48:30.950 --> 03:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
unintentional when it's unintentional
 
03:48:33.710 --> 03:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
they call it willful ignorance uh they
 
03:48:36.429 --> 03:48:36.439 align:start position:0%
they suggest and I can give you a list
 
03:48:36.439 --> 03:48:37.189 align:start position:0%
they suggest and I can give you a list
of

03:48:37.189 --> 03:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:48:39.590 --> 03:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
citations a mile long we could talk
 
03:48:41.110 --> 03:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
about Barbara Appel bong's being white
 
03:48:42.510 --> 03:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
being good we could talk about Robin
 
03:48:44.830 --> 03:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
D'Angelo's white fragility we could talk
 
03:48:48.550 --> 03:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
about uh Allison Bailey's paper about
 
03:48:50.550 --> 03:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
privilege preserving epistemic push back
 
03:48:51.990 --> 03:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
the belief in critical race theory is
 
03:48:53.429 --> 03:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
that any disagreement with critical race
 
03:48:56.030 --> 03:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
Theory must come from motives that uh
 
03:48:58.710 --> 03:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
wish to support uh white supremacy and
 
03:49:00.429 --> 03:49:00.439 align:start position:0%
racism and in fact they say that people
 
03:49:02.710 --> 03:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
who benefit from that by virtue of the
 
03:49:04.389 --> 03:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
color of their skin or because they are
 
03:49:06.910 --> 03:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
selling out if they races other than say
 
03:49:09.149 --> 03:49:09.159 align:start position:0%
white or what they term white adjacent
 
03:49:09.159 --> 03:49:09.870 align:start position:0%
white or what they term white adjacent
um

03:49:09.870 --> 03:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:12.750 --> 03:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
have have uh little motivation to
 
03:49:14.710 --> 03:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
disrupt their own racial Comfort that's
 
03:49:18.030 --> 03:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
their words and therefore have uh strong
 
03:49:19.510 --> 03:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
motivation to oppose critical race
 
03:49:21.389 --> 03:49:21.399 align:start position:0%
theory for self- beneficial ultimately
 
03:49:24.189 --> 03:49:24.199 align:start position:0%
racist reasons that help to uphold that
 
03:49:27.389 --> 03:49:27.399 align:start position:0%
alleged racist white supremacy uh system
 
03:49:28.870 --> 03:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
that they claim as the ordinary
 
03:49:30.950 --> 03:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
operating system of society so it's very
 
03:49:32.189 --> 03:49:32.199 align:start position:0%
important to understand that it's
 
03:49:34.149 --> 03:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
impossible to disagree with critical
 
03:49:36.550 --> 03:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
race Theory uh without being accused of
 
03:49:38.429 --> 03:49:38.439 align:start position:0%
being a racist or a white supremacist
 
03:49:40.630 --> 03:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
and you get used to it after a
 
03:49:44.110 --> 03:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
while thank you we will attempt not to
 
03:49:47.710 --> 03:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
insult anyone at this hearing and to all
 
03:49:49.710 --> 03:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
the participants who are here raising
 
03:49:52.870 --> 03:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
their hands I have a list of 26 people
 
03:49:55.630 --> 03:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
who have signed up to speak I will be
 
03:49:58.469 --> 03:49:58.479 align:start position:0%
calling on them and then I will be
 
03:50:00.830 --> 03:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
asking for other people who didn't get a
 
03:50:04.870 --> 03:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
chance only raise your hand if
 
03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
you're if your name is called and we're
 
03:50:10.030 --> 03:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
having trouble finding you thank thank
 
03:50:18.149 --> 03:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:21.389 --> 03:50:21.399 align:start position:0%
Barnes Mr Ken Barnes yes I'm I'm trying
 
03:50:24.189 --> 03:50:24.199 align:start position:0%
to unmute and uh make myself visible to
 
03:50:26.630 --> 03:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you madam chair I
 
03:50:29.429 --> 03:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak here
 
03:50:33.790 --> 03:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
um I want to oppose this
 
03:50:37.790 --> 03:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
bill and I certainly agree with the
 
03:50:40.269 --> 03:50:40.279 align:start position:0%
chair I do not want to insult anyone and
 
03:50:45.269 --> 03:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
I will try my best not to um I have to
 
03:50:47.790 --> 03:50:47.800 align:start position:0%
say uh just with respect to the previous
 
03:50:49.830 --> 03:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
speaker Mr Dr
 
03:50:52.790 --> 03:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
Lindsay um I'm not sure what relevance
 
03:50:56.070 --> 03:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
it really has to even go into a
 
03:50:59.950 --> 03:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
dissertation about uh what what he
 
03:51:03.189 --> 03:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
thinks most critical race theorists uh
 
03:51:03.199 --> 03:51:04.149 align:start position:0%
thinks most critical race theorists uh
think

03:51:04.149 --> 03:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:51:09.429 --> 03:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
or or say uh I don't think the committ
 
03:51:13.429 --> 03:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
should should consider what any analysis
 
03:51:16.110 --> 03:51:16.120 align:start position:0%
of critical race Theory the bill as
 
03:51:20.550 --> 03:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
proposed does not directly uh challenge
 
03:51:23.149 --> 03:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
the theory of critical race the the
 
03:51:26.309 --> 03:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
issue is whether people who someone
 
03:51:28.469 --> 03:51:28.479 align:start position:0%
thinks uh
 
03:51:31.950 --> 03:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
propagate is is trying to propagate uh
 
03:51:37.149 --> 03:51:37.159 align:start position:0%
un unacceptable uh positions is going to
 
03:51:42.910 --> 03:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
be uh somehow punished or excluded and I
 
03:51:46.429 --> 03:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
think that's a very dangerous concept
 
03:51:49.830 --> 03:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's dangerous both from a free speech
 
03:51:52.189 --> 03:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
point of view a democracy point of view
 
03:51:55.510 --> 03:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
because who knows uh well who's even
 
03:51:58.910 --> 03:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
deciding if the views being propagated
 
03:52:03.110 --> 03:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh fall into the category of uh being
 
03:52:06.349 --> 03:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
offensive enough to Warrant uh to to
 
03:52:10.110 --> 03:52:10.120 align:start position:0%
fall under the the uh orbit of this Bill
 
03:52:13.590 --> 03:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
and uh who's who's how are the speakers
 
03:52:16.309 --> 03:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
supposed to know what they can say and
 
03:52:18.870 --> 03:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
what they can't say without falling
 
03:52:22.189 --> 03:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
within the Ambit of this bill and uh
 
03:52:24.510 --> 03:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
that is the essence of what First
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment Juris Prudence uh refers to as
 
03:52:31.550 --> 03:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
a chilling effect on uh American free
 
03:52:35.830 --> 03:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
speech rights you don't you you chill
 
03:52:38.469 --> 03:52:38.479 align:start position:0%
you you chill your own speech you you
 
03:52:40.870 --> 03:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
censor your own self because you don't
 
03:52:43.269 --> 03:52:43.279 align:start position:0%
want to say anything that's going to be
 
03:52:46.990 --> 03:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
perceived by the powers that be as uh
 
03:52:51.870 --> 03:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
being illegal or not not appropriate and
 
03:52:56.030 --> 03:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
so uh the the full and fair full and
 
03:52:59.990 --> 03:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
free uh conversation about public issues
 
03:53:03.229 --> 03:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
and the substance of public issues uh we
 
03:53:05.030 --> 03:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
don't get to have that full and free
 
03:53:08.349 --> 03:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
debate because people are self-censoring
 
03:53:11.189 --> 03:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
and afraid to say things because
 
03:53:14.750 --> 03:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
somebody might find it offensive uh and
 
03:53:16.030 --> 03:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
the Supreme
 
03:53:19.189 --> 03:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
Court and the Very Constitution of the
 
03:53:22.389 --> 03:53:22.399 align:start position:0%
United States I think takes the position
 
03:53:25.149 --> 03:53:25.159 align:start position:0%
that we want the most robust discussions
 
03:53:29.429 --> 03:53:29.439 align:start position:0%
of public issues that we can have and uh
 
03:53:32.830 --> 03:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
that uh it's left to what some people
 
03:53:34.030 --> 03:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
some Scholars have called The
 
03:53:37.950 --> 03:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
Marketplace of ideas to sort out which
 
03:53:41.550 --> 03:53:41.560 align:start position:0%
ideas were going to listen to uh and and
 
03:53:42.870 --> 03:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
not not so much listen to We should
 
03:53:44.990 --> 03:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
listen to everybody I think we should
 
03:53:48.630 --> 03:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
all respect each other and listen uh
 
03:53:52.110 --> 03:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
with open open minds to what other folks
 
03:53:56.790 --> 03:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
have to say um and then we assess what
 
03:53:58.550 --> 03:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
they what they say and what everybody
 
03:54:00.870 --> 03:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
else has to say on on the merits on the
 
03:54:03.149 --> 03:54:03.159 align:start position:0%
substance of what they're discussing and
 
03:54:06.510 --> 03:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
we don't write anybody off for being you
 
03:54:09.870 --> 03:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
know too far uh in appropriate too far
 
03:54:12.710 --> 03:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
out out there to consider what they have
 
03:54:14.830 --> 03:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
to say and the only limits that the
 
03:54:17.469 --> 03:54:17.479 align:start position:0%
constitution imposes on the on Free
 
03:54:20.590 --> 03:54:20.600 align:start position:0%
Speech are the equivalent of shouting
 
03:54:22.309 --> 03:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
fire in crowded theater if you're going
 
03:54:25.550 --> 03:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
to be a clear and present present as in
 
03:54:30.309 --> 03:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
imminent danger of uh causing violence
 
03:54:34.229 --> 03:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
or Insurrection or something like that
 
03:54:38.070 --> 03:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
so uh I think the bill is uh again to
 
03:54:40.429 --> 03:54:40.439 align:start position:0%
use a legal term I'm sorry to use a
 
03:54:44.670 --> 03:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
legal term but it's over Brad and it's
 
03:54:46.750 --> 03:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh vague and both of those are reasons
 
03:54:48.590 --> 03:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
why the courts of the United States for
 
03:54:50.670 --> 03:54:50.680 align:start position:0%
200 and some years have been striking
 
03:54:54.309 --> 03:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
down uh such statutes thank you very
 
03:54:57.710 --> 03:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
much and I urge you to uh itl this Bill
 
03:55:02.030 --> 03:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative life laus um
 
03:55:04.070 --> 03:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering I'm I'm reading the
 
03:55:06.469 --> 03:55:06.479 align:start position:0%
bill I don't see where it prohibits
 
03:55:09.870 --> 03:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
anybody saying anything other than when
 
03:55:12.469 --> 03:55:12.479 align:start position:0%
they're using uh State money or you know
 
03:55:15.349 --> 03:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
State and political subdivision money to
 
03:55:17.950 --> 03:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
promote it so is there somewhere in the
 
03:55:20.950 --> 03:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
bill where you believe that U you know
 
03:55:22.710 --> 03:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
General speech or even teaching about
 
03:55:26.269 --> 03:55:26.279 align:start position:0%
these uh things in a general sense is
 
03:55:29.910 --> 03:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
prohibited well the bill um to the
 
03:55:32.950 --> 03:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
extent that it uh cuts off State money
 
03:55:36.550 --> 03:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
to people who run a foul of the bill and
 
03:55:38.550 --> 03:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
that means if a teacher in a school
 
03:55:40.389 --> 03:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
system system and the school system is
 
03:55:43.469 --> 03:55:43.479 align:start position:0%
is getting State money they lose their
 
03:55:46.870 --> 03:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
lose the state money if somebody and
 
03:55:49.070 --> 03:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
it's not clear really who I I think from
 
03:55:52.189 --> 03:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
the bill um
 
03:55:54.110 --> 03:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
propagates uh
 
03:55:57.110 --> 03:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
these ideas that someone thinks are
 
03:56:01.149 --> 03:56:01.159 align:start position:0%
inappropriate so uh that's if you lose
 
03:56:03.950 --> 03:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
your funding it if you're threatened
 
03:56:05.950 --> 03:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
like if you're put in jail you you don't
 
03:56:08.030 --> 03:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
you can still uh exercise your Free
 
03:56:09.870 --> 03:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
Speech but you're going to put in jail
 
03:56:12.510 --> 03:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
if you uh exercise your free speech and
 
03:56:14.309 --> 03:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to lose your funding and
 
03:56:16.110 --> 03:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
the school system relies on its funding
 
03:56:20.830 --> 03:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
to educate children then that uh that
 
03:56:23.429 --> 03:56:23.439 align:start position:0%
that t them out to a
 
03:56:25.750 --> 03:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
Prohibition you don't want to do things
 
03:56:29.110 --> 03:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh somebody's gonna uh slap you down put
 
03:56:31.149 --> 03:56:31.159 align:start position:0%
you in jail or cut off your
 
03:56:34.950 --> 03:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
money thank you represent alra can
 
03:56:37.750 --> 03:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
institutions lose their Public Funding
 
03:56:39.990 --> 03:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
now for
 
03:56:45.349 --> 03:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:49.030 --> 03:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
inappropriate you asking me I take it uh
 
03:56:54.630 --> 03:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
I uh don't think so um not that I know
 
03:56:56.149 --> 03:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
of I'd be happy
 
03:56:59.349 --> 03:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
to entertain the idea of something that
 
03:57:01.349 --> 03:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
you think might do that but I don't
 
03:57:03.910 --> 03:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
think uh saying something inappropriate
 
03:57:07.309 --> 03:57:07.319 align:start position:0%

testifying today in strong support of HB
 
03:57:37.830 --> 03:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
544 after last week's hearing
 
03:57:39.710 --> 03:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative CHR Chris Schultz tweeted
 
03:57:41.950 --> 03:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
the following a bunch of racists in New
 
03:57:44.269 --> 03:57:44.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are promoting a racist bill
 
03:57:45.910 --> 03:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
that says we should stop pointing out
 
03:57:48.790 --> 03:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
how dank white supremacy is she also
 
03:57:50.590 --> 03:57:50.600 align:start position:0%
publicly insinuated that anyone who
 
03:57:52.790 --> 03:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
disagrees with her
 
03:57:56.950 --> 03:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
Miss Dr bco I've muted you please do not
 
03:57:59.189 --> 03:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
attack members of the committee do not
 
03:58:07.510 --> 03:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:07.520 --> 03:58:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:58:10.790 --> 03:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:12.269 --> 03:58:12.279 align:start position:0%
she can send us copies of that tweet
 
03:58:14.870 --> 03:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
though if she wants what's that she can
 
03:58:16.950 --> 03:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
send us copies of that tweet by email if
 
03:58:18.710 --> 03:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
she want thank
 
03:58:20.830 --> 03:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
youy I'm not sure if I was off mute
 
03:58:22.590 --> 03:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
there but I will say I'm not imputing
 
03:58:24.710 --> 03:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
her motives I am saying that this she
 
03:58:26.149 --> 03:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
has made public statements in this
 
03:58:27.910 --> 03:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
regard and I'm bringing it up to
 
03:58:30.030 --> 03:58:30.040 align:start position:0%
articulate that nothing is further from
 
03:58:33.590 --> 03:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
the truth about this bill those are lies
 
03:58:36.750 --> 03:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
this bill opposes racism it does
 
03:58:38.269 --> 03:58:38.279 align:start position:0%
precisely the opposite of what people
 
03:58:39.710 --> 03:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
like representative Schultz are trying
 
03:58:41.870 --> 03:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
to get you to believe now you just heard
 
03:58:43.950 --> 03:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
from Dr Lindsay so I won't repeat what
 
03:58:46.070 --> 03:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
he said about critical race Theory but I
 
03:58:48.030 --> 03:58:48.040 align:start position:0%
have been working non-stop to understand
 
03:58:49.830 --> 03:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
this ideology and its impact on
 
03:58:52.070 --> 03:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
organizations and individuals for the
 
03:58:54.309 --> 03:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
last two years and here are the
 
03:58:56.229 --> 03:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
conclusions that I've come to critical
 
03:58:59.070 --> 03:58:59.080 align:start position:0%
race theory is dangerous and toxic it
 
03:59:01.389 --> 03:59:01.399 align:start position:0%
teaches people to hate themselves and
 
03:59:04.110 --> 03:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
inflicts tremendous pain and guilt for
 
03:59:06.950 --> 03:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
things they are not responsible for let
 
03:59:08.950 --> 03:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
me be really blun
 
03:59:11.469 --> 03:59:11.479 align:start position:0%
critical race Theory teaches people that
 
03:59:14.590 --> 03:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
if you were born white you are
 
03:59:17.189 --> 03:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
inherently racist and yes representative
 
03:59:19.269 --> 03:59:19.279 align:start position:0%
Schultz that even includes you the
 
03:59:20.990 --> 03:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
best-selling book White fragility is one
 
03:59:22.750 --> 03:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
of the Bibles of critical race Theory
 
03:59:25.309 --> 03:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
and in it author Robin D'Angelo herself
 
03:59:27.670 --> 03:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
a white woman confesses that she has
 
03:59:30.229 --> 03:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
been racist since the womb has been
 
03:59:32.510 --> 03:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
racist her entire life and will always
 
03:59:35.429 --> 03:59:35.439 align:start position:0%
be a racist simply because she is born
 
03:59:37.630 --> 03:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
white it is not a question of if you are
 
03:59:40.149 --> 03:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
a racist it is is assumed and the only
 
03:59:42.950 --> 03:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
question is how your racism manifest HB
 
03:59:45.550 --> 03:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
544 would specifically ban these ideas
 
03:59:47.429 --> 03:59:47.439 align:start position:0%
from entering into state agencies and
 
03:59:50.030 --> 03:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
state contractors under the guise of
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
diversity training now I'm an
 
03:59:53.670 --> 03:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
organizational psychologist I do
 
03:59:56.389 --> 03:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
corporate training for a living not all
 
03:59:58.389 --> 03:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
diversity training is based on critical
 
04:00:00.149 --> 04:00:00.159 align:start position:0%
race Theory there are wonderful
 
04:00:01.990 --> 04:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
diversity training programs out there
 
04:00:03.349 --> 04:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
that have nothing to do with this
 
04:00:06.070 --> 04:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
ideology and would not be impacted by
 
04:00:07.950 --> 04:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
this bill the Democrats who are telling
 
04:00:09.429 --> 04:00:09.439 align:start position:0%
people that this bill would ban
 
04:00:11.950 --> 04:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
diversity training are lying to you the
 
04:00:14.469 --> 04:00:14.479 align:start position:0%
bill only addresses trainings that teach
 
04:00:16.349 --> 04:00:16.359 align:start position:0%
people they are racist because of how
 
04:00:18.429 --> 04:00:18.439 align:start position:0%
they were born let me tell you how this
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
training manifests in organizations they
 
04:00:23.710 --> 04:00:23.720 align:start position:0%
start off by segregating the white
 
04:00:25.710 --> 04:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
employees from all of the non-white
 
04:00:28.309 --> 04:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
employees yes under critical race Theory
 
04:00:31.630 --> 04:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
segregation is a good thing then they
 
04:00:33.670 --> 04:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
make the white employees confess to
 
04:00:35.670 --> 04:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
their racism and sometimes even write
 
04:00:37.389 --> 04:00:37.399 align:start position:0%
letters of apology to non-white
 
04:00:39.790 --> 04:00:39.800 align:start position:0%
employees even even if their behavior
 
04:00:43.149 --> 04:00:43.159 align:start position:0%
has not been racist in any way remember
 
04:00:45.469 --> 04:00:45.479 align:start position:0%
their racism is assumed because of how
 
04:00:47.389 --> 04:00:47.399 align:start position:0%
they were born and if the white
 
04:00:49.990 --> 04:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
employees push back or refuse or even if
 
04:00:51.750 --> 04:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
they just ask questions about why their
 
04:00:54.110 --> 04:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
organization is making them admit that
 
04:00:56.149 --> 04:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
they're racists they are in very real
 
04:00:58.750 --> 04:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
danger of losing their jobs so that is
 
04:01:00.550 --> 04:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
the choice when this training comes into
 
04:01:02.269 --> 04:01:02.279 align:start position:0%
organizations you either confess that
 
04:01:05.590 --> 04:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
you're a racist or you lose your job
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
that's bad enough but let me give you
 
04:01:09.910 --> 04:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
evidence and a practical reason to
 
04:01:12.309 --> 04:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
support this bill there is absolutely no
 
04:01:14.269 --> 04:01:14.279 align:start position:0%
evidence that training based on critical
 
04:01:17.269 --> 04:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
race theory is effective none zero zilch
 
04:01:19.229 --> 04:01:19.239 align:start position:0%
and I know I've looked as an
 
04:01:20.910 --> 04:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
organizational psychologist if something
 
04:01:22.309 --> 04:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
is effective in the
 
04:01:25.510 --> 04:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
work thank you Miss Verano I think we've
 
04:01:28.349 --> 04:01:28.359 align:start position:0%
we've gotten your testimony is there do
 
04:01:31.030 --> 04:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
you have a few seconds of highlight that
 
04:01:33.830 --> 04:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
you want to add well I think that um
 
04:01:35.630 --> 04:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
there is there is one more thing in that
 
04:01:36.950 --> 04:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
there is you are going to hear no
 
04:01:38.510 --> 04:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
testimony today that says this this
 
04:01:39.870 --> 04:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
training is effective and as a New
 
04:01:41.910 --> 04:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State resident if my tax
 
04:01:43.990 --> 04:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
dollars are being spent on something I
 
04:01:45.429 --> 04:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
want to know that it's actually
 
04:01:47.469 --> 04:01:47.479 align:start position:0%
effective so critical race Theory
 
04:01:50.990 --> 04:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
creates more racism not less it is not
 
04:01:53.070 --> 04:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
going to make organizations fairer more
 
04:01:54.870 --> 04:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
more open more diverse or any of those
 
04:01:56.469 --> 04:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
things is going to do exactly the
 
04:01:58.309 --> 04:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
opposite so I strongly encourage
 
04:01:59.830 --> 04:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
everyone to support this bill and
 
04:02:01.630 --> 04:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
protect the people of New Hampshire from
 
04:02:02.830 --> 04:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
this harmful
 
04:02:07.149 --> 04:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
ideology thank you are there any
 
04:02:07.159 --> 04:02:08.910 align:start position:0%
ideology thank you are there any
questions

04:02:08.910 --> 04:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:02:12.030 --> 04:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair I wasn't
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
going to address the comments she
 
04:02:17.149 --> 04:02:17.159 align:start position:0%
directed at me I did have a genuine
 
04:02:20.950 --> 04:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
question yes if it's a question ask it
 
04:02:23.950 --> 04:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
since this bill also addresses gender
 
04:02:28.189 --> 04:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
and um well gender uh I just wanted to
 
04:02:31.229 --> 04:02:31.239 align:start position:0%
see if you're the same Carolyn borisenko
 
04:02:33.630 --> 04:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
who wrote the article in Forge magazine
 
04:02:36.750 --> 04:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
about the gender pay Gap yes absolutely
 
04:02:39.030 --> 04:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
I am the gender pay Gap is a and I Dr
 
04:02:41.830 --> 04:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
bareno thank
 
04:02:46.229 --> 04:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you that answers the
 
04:02:51.590 --> 04:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:53.590 --> 04:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
Bennett hi thank you to the committee
 
04:02:55.710 --> 04:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
for hearing this testimony in opposition
 
04:02:56.990 --> 04:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
to HB
 
04:02:59.309 --> 04:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
544 my name is Jacob Bennett and I
 
04:03:01.309 --> 04:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
represent myself today uh for the sake
 
04:03:03.070 --> 04:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
of full disclosure I would like to note
 
04:03:05.149 --> 04:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
that I am currently employed as an
 
04:03:07.349 --> 04:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
adjunct in the education department at
 
04:03:07.359 --> 04:03:09.189 align:start position:0%
adjunct in the education department at
unh

04:03:09.189 --> 04:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
unh
 
04:03:12.309 --> 04:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
um HP 544 does not identify critical
 
04:03:14.229 --> 04:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
race theory in its description of
 
04:03:16.590 --> 04:03:16.600 align:start position:0%
divisive Concepts but seems to be a
 
04:03:18.670 --> 04:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
fairly transparent reaction to it and
 
04:03:20.830 --> 04:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
other critical lines of inquiry that
 
04:03:23.030 --> 04:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
seek to identify and dismantle systemic
 
04:03:25.429 --> 04:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
racism sexism ableism and
 
04:03:28.790 --> 04:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
heteronormativity in our society uh and
 
04:03:29.910 --> 04:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
in any case one of the Bill's
 
04:03:32.590 --> 04:03:32.600 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors identified CRT by name when
 
04:03:35.229 --> 04:03:35.239 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill last week as to the
 
04:03:36.590 --> 04:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
text of the bill it appears to
 
04:03:38.550 --> 04:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
misconstrue the premise and and purpose
 
04:03:40.910 --> 04:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
of critical inquiry which does not rely
 
04:03:43.070 --> 04:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
on essentialist Notions of race or sex
 
04:03:45.710 --> 04:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
or gender or ability but instead relies
 
04:03:48.110 --> 04:03:48.120 align:start position:0%

04:03:51.030 --> 04:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
developments and current practice in law
 
04:03:52.309 --> 04:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
and in broader
 
04:03:55.309 --> 04:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
Society um critiques of CRT often
 
04:03:58.110 --> 04:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
indicate that the theory uh is meant to
 
04:04:00.510 --> 04:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
mean that there are sets of essential
 
04:04:02.670 --> 04:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
qualities that inhere in white people or
 
04:04:04.590 --> 04:04:04.600 align:start position:0%
other kinds of people and that those
 
04:04:07.189 --> 04:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
qualities are oppressive and inescapable
 
04:04:09.030 --> 04:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
but a more faith interpretation of the
 
04:04:11.229 --> 04:04:11.239 align:start position:0%
theory is that there is no essential
 
04:04:13.790 --> 04:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
quality inherent to any race only the
 
04:04:15.630 --> 04:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
socially constructed systems of meaning
 
04:04:17.149 --> 04:04:17.159 align:start position:0%
that come to feel true through
 
04:04:19.349 --> 04:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
generational perpetuation and come to
 
04:04:21.389 --> 04:04:21.399 align:start position:0%
feel immutable through establishment of
 
04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
norms expectations and laws the critical
 
04:04:26.309 --> 04:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
theorists need not be concerned with the
 
04:04:28.630 --> 04:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
beliefs or best intentions of white men
 
04:04:30.670 --> 04:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
or people of any background or identity
 
04:04:32.870 --> 04:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
for that matter in order to establish
 
04:04:34.630 --> 04:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
the clear record of racist and
 
04:04:37.149 --> 04:04:37.159 align:start position:0%
misogynist and homophobic brutality that
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
pervades the EST establishment of this
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
country the capitalist system which
 
04:04:42.790 --> 04:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
launched it into Global preeminence and
 
04:04:45.269 --> 04:04:45.279 align:start position:0%
which persists today in many forms
 
04:04:47.550 --> 04:04:47.560 align:start position:0%
current intentions good or bad have
 
04:04:50.149 --> 04:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the systemic problems
 
04:04:52.429 --> 04:04:52.439 align:start position:0%
that are the target of critical inquiry
 
04:04:54.510 --> 04:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
even if overt and clearly articulated
 
04:04:56.910 --> 04:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
bigotry infuses the foundations of those
 
04:04:56.920 --> 04:04:57.870 align:start position:0%
bigotry infuses the foundations of those
historic

04:04:57.870 --> 04:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
historic
 
04:05:00.189 --> 04:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
challenges instead the critical list is
 
04:05:02.189 --> 04:05:02.199 align:start position:0%
focused on disperate outcomes that
 
04:05:04.269 --> 04:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
continue to hinder equity and equal
 
04:05:06.229 --> 04:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
standing in our society for women for
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
people of color for queer folks for our
 
04:05:09.590 --> 04:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
friends and family with different
 
04:05:12.189 --> 04:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
abilities and we see these disparities
 
04:05:13.990 --> 04:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
in educational attainments and college
 
04:05:16.429 --> 04:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
debt burdens as well as in iniquitous
 
04:05:18.469 --> 04:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
distributions of resources leading to
 
04:05:21.030 --> 04:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
short earnings and shaky career ladders
 
04:05:22.790 --> 04:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
even the ability to work remotely and
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
continue earning during this pandemic
 
04:05:27.070 --> 04:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
depends a great deal on economic status
 
04:05:29.229 --> 04:05:29.239 align:start position:0%
and job description as well as race and
 
04:05:31.590 --> 04:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
gender all told every sector in the
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
economy has be tou been touched by these
 
04:05:35.990 --> 04:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
social ills not least of all higher
 
04:05:37.990 --> 04:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
education where I have been working for
 
04:05:40.750 --> 04:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
the last 15 years well-respected leaders
 
04:05:42.510 --> 04:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
in human resources and education have
 
04:05:44.110 --> 04:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
come to what I believe is a consensus
 
04:05:45.630 --> 04:05:45.640 align:start position:0%
that we must consider the equity
 
04:05:48.189 --> 04:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
implications of policy across race sex
 
04:05:49.870 --> 04:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
gender and ability categories and that
 
04:05:51.870 --> 04:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
we must confront those implications
 
04:05:54.429 --> 04:05:54.439 align:start position:0%
headon to do that we must teach each
 
04:05:56.349 --> 04:05:56.359 align:start position:0%
other and learn from each other how to
 
04:05:58.229 --> 04:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
conduct the necessary inquiry and enact
 
04:06:00.670 --> 04:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
the necessary changes required to do so
 
04:06:02.429 --> 04:06:02.439 align:start position:0%
not only in higher education but across
 
04:06:04.269 --> 04:06:04.279 align:start position:0%
all disciplines agencies and social
 
04:06:06.870 --> 04:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
programs this bill suggests that the
 
04:06:09.149 --> 04:06:09.159 align:start position:0%
real evil is the inquiry into the living
 
04:06:11.670 --> 04:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
vestages of historic iniquity rather
 
04:06:14.349 --> 04:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
than the iniquities themselves with this
 
04:06:15.990 --> 04:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
testimony I've included an article by
 
04:06:17.349 --> 04:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
the current chair of the Department of
 
04:06:18.910 --> 04:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
Education studies at Ohio State
 
04:06:21.030 --> 04:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
University which I believe may serve as
 
04:06:23.149 --> 04:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
a proper introduction to the CRT with
 
04:06:25.269 --> 04:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
which I am familiar and hopefully may
 
04:06:27.030 --> 04:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
serve as a corrective against what seem
 
04:06:29.149 --> 04:06:29.159 align:start position:0%
to be misconceptions of the theory and
 
04:06:31.590 --> 04:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
the work it asks us to do in that
 
04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
article Dr Lorie Patton Davis quotes
 
04:06:35.309 --> 04:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
from an earlier collaboration of hers
 
04:06:37.429 --> 04:06:37.439 align:start position:0%
noting that quote the lack of effort to
 
04:06:39.389 --> 04:06:39.399 align:start position:0%
explicit licitly grapple with racism and
 
04:06:42.630 --> 04:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
white Su white supremacy is pers a
 
04:06:44.870 --> 04:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
persistent Trend that is symptomatic of
 
04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
a society that would rather tiptoe
 
04:06:49.030 --> 04:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
around the issue of race than directly
 
04:06:52.149 --> 04:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
address it end quote the point of all of
 
04:06:53.830 --> 04:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
that is to say that this bill doesn't
 
04:06:57.389 --> 04:06:57.399 align:start position:0%
named CRT but it is aimed straight at
 
04:06:59.550 --> 04:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
CRT um but it does so with a
 
04:07:01.389 --> 04:07:01.399 align:start position:0%
misconstrual and a misconception of what
 
04:07:03.830 --> 04:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
that means in addition to my concerns
 
04:07:05.389 --> 04:07:05.399 align:start position:0%
that the bill misconstrues the purpose
 
04:07:07.429 --> 04:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
and practice of CRT I am also deeply
 
04:07:09.469 --> 04:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
concerned ConEd that this bill infringes
 
04:07:11.389 --> 04:07:11.399 align:start position:0%
on the Free Speech rights guaranteed in
 
04:07:12.790 --> 04:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment of the US
 
04:07:14.990 --> 04:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution as well as article 22 of
 
04:07:17.389 --> 04:07:17.399 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution given the
 
04:07:20.110 --> 04:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
similarities between HB 544 and former
 
04:07:22.429 --> 04:07:22.439 align:start position:0%
president Trump's executive order
 
04:07:25.469 --> 04:07:25.479 align:start position:0%
13950 it should be noted that the order
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
that Trump uh put forward in September
 
04:07:29.750 --> 04:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
was blocked from imple implementation by
 
04:07:32.109 --> 04:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
a federal district court injunction on
 
04:07:33.510 --> 04:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
grounds that it appeared to violate
 
04:07:35.149 --> 04:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
First Amendment protections as well as
 
04:07:37.710 --> 04:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
due process rights uh that National
 
04:07:39.309 --> 04:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
conjunction was sustained on several
 
04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
grounds including that plaintiffs had
 
04:07:43.349 --> 04:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
standing to bring pre-enforcement First
 
04:07:45.309 --> 04:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment challenge that plaintiffs were
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
likely to succeed on the merits of their
 
04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
first amendment claim that plaintiffs
 
04:07:50.510 --> 04:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
were likely to succeed on the merits of
 
04:07:52.590 --> 04:07:52.600 align:start position:0%
their due process claim alleging that
 
04:07:54.510 --> 04:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
the executive order was void for
 
04:07:56.950 --> 04:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
vagueness I see no reason why the courts
 
04:07:58.510 --> 04:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
would see this bill any differently in
 
04:08:00.510 --> 04:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
terms of the very real harm it would do
 
04:08:03.469 --> 04:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
to speech and due process rights um I
 
04:08:04.910 --> 04:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
conclude the written testimony which
 
04:08:06.670 --> 04:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
I've submitted to the te the committee
 
04:08:08.429 --> 04:08:08.439 align:start position:0%
with a few rhetorical questions I won't
 
04:08:10.349 --> 04:08:10.359 align:start position:0%
read them out loud here but the basic
 
04:08:13.109 --> 04:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
premise comes down to this um given that
 
04:08:16.109 --> 04:08:16.119 align:start position:0%
there will be political appointees uh
 
04:08:18.630 --> 04:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
under this bill if passed I wonder uh
 
04:08:20.229 --> 04:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
whether they'll be coming to my class to
 
04:08:21.790 --> 04:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that I'm not saying the wrong
 
04:08:23.830 --> 04:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
things and if I do say the wrong things
 
04:08:25.510 --> 04:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
I wonder if they're going to fire me on
 
04:08:28.149 --> 04:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
the spot or just uh start to defund my
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
program or the department or the college
 
04:08:33.710 --> 04:08:33.720 align:start position:0%
or the university that I work for um I
 
04:08:35.309 --> 04:08:35.319 align:start position:0%
don't see how this could F could
 
04:08:37.389 --> 04:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
functionally be enforced um but that's
 
04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
the least of my concerns with it I
 
04:08:41.349 --> 04:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
respectfully register my opposition to
 
04:08:43.229 --> 04:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
this bill I also have a PhD but you can
 
04:08:44.870 --> 04:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
call me Jacob if you have any questions
 
04:08:48.510 --> 04:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take them thank you uh
 
04:08:50.229 --> 04:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
representative Alro do you have a
 
04:08:52.630 --> 04:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
question yes did I understand uh
 
04:08:55.590 --> 04:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
correctly that uh racism is a
 
04:08:58.149 --> 04:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
manifestation of capitalism is that what
 
04:09:00.950 --> 04:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
you said no it's the
 
04:09:02.790 --> 04:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
opposite I
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
I please do not argue with the witness
 
04:09:07.550 --> 04:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just trying to happy to give
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations for texts what's that
 
04:09:11.790 --> 04:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
Gerald B horn wrote a great book on it
 
04:09:14.070 --> 04:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
called the counter uh counter
 
04:09:16.389 --> 04:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
Insurrection would you so then let me
 
04:09:19.590 --> 04:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
ask it this way would you um please
 
04:09:22.870 --> 04:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
rephrase what you said um regarding the
 
04:09:24.510 --> 04:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
relationship between the establishment
 
04:09:27.149 --> 04:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
of capitalism in this country would not
 
04:09:30.710 --> 04:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
have happened without the uh uh hundreds
 
04:09:32.990 --> 04:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
of years of slavery that allowed it to
 
04:09:35.750 --> 04:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
happen that's what I'm saying thank you
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:46.149 --> 04:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:50.269 --> 04:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:53.710 --> 04:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
morning morning I'd like to uh speak uh
 
04:09:55.389 --> 04:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
on behalf of in support of this bill
 
04:09:57.429 --> 04:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
rather um if you look at the language in
 
04:09:59.750 --> 04:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
the bill it's quite clear all it does is
 
04:10:03.109 --> 04:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
say that you can not uh stereotype
 
04:10:05.990 --> 04:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
scapegoat or demean individuals on the
 
04:10:08.309 --> 04:10:08.319 align:start position:0%
basis of race and sex uh this is the
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
basic moral takeaway of the 14th
 
04:10:13.870 --> 04:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment and of the 1964 Civil Rights
 
04:10:16.149 --> 04:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
Act uh critical race Theory as it's
 
04:10:18.990 --> 04:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
implemented in institutions um actually
 
04:10:21.030 --> 04:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
does all of those things it stereotypes
 
04:10:23.309 --> 04:10:23.319 align:start position:0%
scapegoats and demeans it traffics in
 
04:10:25.950 --> 04:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
Notions of race essentialism uh it
 
04:10:27.750 --> 04:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
promotes harmful and divisive
 
04:10:30.109 --> 04:10:30.119 align:start position:0%
stereotypes based on inborn
 
04:10:32.229 --> 04:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
characteristics um it also creates a
 
04:10:33.750 --> 04:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
hostile working environment and would
 
04:10:36.950 --> 04:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
put the state at risk of legal action uh
 
04:10:39.630 --> 04:10:39.640 align:start position:0%
and finally uh I think that it's very
 
04:10:41.830 --> 04:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
clear that these are also violations in
 
04:10:44.030 --> 04:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
many cases of the Civil Rights Act I'm
 
04:10:45.469 --> 04:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
the director of the center on wealth and
 
04:10:47.269 --> 04:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
poverty at Discovery Institute I'm a
 
04:10:49.349 --> 04:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
contributing editor at City Journal
 
04:10:52.389 --> 04:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
magazine um and a visiting fellow this
 
04:10:54.990 --> 04:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
year at the Heritage Foundation uh I've
 
04:10:56.309 --> 04:10:56.319 align:start position:0%
studied critical race Theory I've done
 
04:10:57.550 --> 04:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
the investigative reporting and I'd like
 
04:10:59.189 --> 04:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
to just share a few examples of what
 
04:11:02.189 --> 04:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
happens uh in the real world uh as these
 
04:11:04.510 --> 04:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
programs are implemented that this bill
 
04:11:07.429 --> 04:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
seeks to prevent I reported on um the
 
04:11:09.389 --> 04:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
Sandia National Laboratories which
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
produces designs and produces the
 
04:11:13.670 --> 04:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
nuclear weapons arsenal of the United
 
04:11:16.269 --> 04:11:16.279 align:start position:0%
States government uh they recently took
 
04:11:18.950 --> 04:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
white male Executives uh and then forced
 
04:11:20.950 --> 04:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
them in a training session uh to
 
04:11:23.510 --> 04:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
deconstruct their white male identity it
 
04:11:24.910 --> 04:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
said that being a white male is
 
04:11:27.149 --> 04:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
analogous to the KKK to White
 
04:11:29.670 --> 04:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
supremacists and to lynching and then
 
04:11:32.590 --> 04:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
forc them to apologize uh for their
 
04:11:35.349 --> 04:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
inborn traits uh and write letters of
 
04:11:37.710 --> 04:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
apology uh and in the abstra ract to
 
04:11:40.070 --> 04:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
women and people of color uh for the way
 
04:11:42.750 --> 04:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
that they were born um in education
 
04:11:44.590 --> 04:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
these programs are deeply harmful I've
 
04:11:47.670 --> 04:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
reported on recently a story where first
 
04:11:49.870 --> 04:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
graders in California were forced to
 
04:11:51.429 --> 04:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
deconstruct their racial and sexual
 
04:11:53.349 --> 04:11:53.359 align:start position:0%
identities and then rank themselves
 
04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
according to their power and privilege
 
04:11:56.710 --> 04:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
telling F some first graders that they
 
04:11:58.590 --> 04:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
were the oppressors and some first
 
04:12:00.510 --> 04:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
graders that they were the oppressed
 
04:12:02.910 --> 04:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
I've also reported uh on a story
 
04:12:05.870 --> 04:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
recently in New York City where a public
 
04:12:08.189 --> 04:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
middle and high school sent a email to
 
04:12:10.870 --> 04:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
White parents telling them that uh they
 
04:12:13.670 --> 04:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
had to do white identity work um and
 
04:12:15.870 --> 04:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
that the highest goal as a white person
 
04:12:18.189 --> 04:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
should be to become become a quote white
 
04:12:20.590 --> 04:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
traitor and eventually advocate for
 
04:12:23.590 --> 04:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
quote white abolition uh this is
 
04:12:25.830 --> 04:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
language that applied to any other group
 
04:12:28.750 --> 04:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
would be considered a euphemism for
 
04:12:31.030 --> 04:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
elimination um this kind of rhetoric is
 
04:12:34.309 --> 04:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
deeply divisive it hurts people and and
 
04:12:37.269 --> 04:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
finally uh it's actually in in PR
 
04:12:40.990 --> 04:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
practice deeply uh condescending and and
 
04:12:44.309 --> 04:12:44.319 align:start position:0%
patronizing towards uh people of color
 
04:12:46.389 --> 04:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
um critical race Theory argues in many
 
04:12:47.950 --> 04:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
training sessions that I've documented
 
04:12:50.950 --> 04:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
and reported on that traits of
 
04:12:50.960 --> 04:12:52.590 align:start position:0%
and reported on that traits of
rationalism

04:12:52.590 --> 04:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
rationalism
 
04:12:55.830 --> 04:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
individuality logic and punctuality are
 
04:12:58.149 --> 04:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
manifestations of white supremacy uh
 
04:13:01.670 --> 04:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
implying that uh African-Americans and
 
04:13:04.630 --> 04:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
Latinos Asians and Native Americans are
 
04:13:07.189 --> 04:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
somehow not able to exhibit the
 
04:13:10.349 --> 04:13:10.359 align:start position:0%
qualities of rationality or punctuality
 
04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh or even logic um this kind of
 
04:13:16.990 --> 04:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
ideology is deeply corrosive at its core
 
04:13:20.070 --> 04:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's fundamentally racist and again the
 
04:13:22.510 --> 04:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
language of this bill says you cannot be
 
04:13:25.269 --> 04:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
racist or sexist you cannot degrade
 
04:13:27.149 --> 04:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
demean or stereotype people on the basis
 
04:13:29.710 --> 04:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
of race or sex uh anyone who votes for
 
04:13:32.149 --> 04:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
this bill uh would be basically saying
 
04:13:35.109 --> 04:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
that we support and will will allow uh
 
04:13:36.950 --> 04:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
racism and sexism to proliferate through
 
04:13:39.590 --> 04:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
the institutions um it's a very simple
 
04:13:42.870 --> 04:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
moral question uh don't be uh kind of
 
04:13:46.149 --> 04:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
Taken astray uh by the very verbose
 
04:13:48.349 --> 04:13:48.359 align:start position:0%
academic language of some of my
 
04:13:50.790 --> 04:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
opponents supporting or opposing this
 
04:13:53.429 --> 04:13:53.439 align:start position:0%
bill um it's very simple look what
 
04:13:56.030 --> 04:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
happens in practice um and uh please
 
04:13:58.349 --> 04:13:58.359 align:start position:0%
stand up uh for the right thing in
 
04:14:00.790 --> 04:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
defense of civil rights uh in defense of
 
04:14:03.349 --> 04:14:03.359 align:start position:0%
logic and rationality uh and in defense
 
04:14:05.389 --> 04:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
of treating people equally no matter how
 
04:14:09.109 --> 04:14:09.119 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
04:15:18.790 --> 04:15:18.800 align:start position:0%

on
 
04:16:45.149 --> 04:16:45.159 align:start position:0%
it I keep trying to promote him the

04:17:23.109 --> 04:17:23.119 align:start position:0%

04:17:25.590 --> 04:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
headset can you hear me now yeah we hear
 
04:17:27.510 --> 04:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
you now go ahead thank you uh
 
04:17:29.229 --> 04:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
fundamentally what this bill seeks to
 
04:17:31.149 --> 04:17:31.159 align:start position:0%
prohibit is the mandatory training of
 
04:17:33.630 --> 04:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
critical theory in government I could
 
04:17:35.309 --> 04:17:35.319 align:start position:0%
open with the fact that critical theory
 
04:17:37.550 --> 04:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
is of a Marxist origin that it
 
04:17:39.550 --> 04:17:39.560 align:start position:0%
explicitly rejects the civil rights
 
04:17:42.469 --> 04:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
movement and equality under law I could
 
04:17:44.469 --> 04:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
describe how it is not in the liberal
 
04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
tradition and these things are true
 
04:17:49.830 --> 04:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
however Americans have the right to hold
 
04:17:52.189 --> 04:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
these beliefs and they have the right to
 
04:17:54.269 --> 04:17:54.279 align:start position:0%
espouse them that is their protected
 
04:17:57.030 --> 04:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
First Amendment right what we're here to
 
04:17:58.750 --> 04:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
talk about is workplace
 
04:18:01.269 --> 04:18:01.279 align:start position:0%
training but when people are trained in
 
04:18:04.189 --> 04:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
ideology they are not learning a skill
 
04:18:07.109 --> 04:18:07.119 align:start position:0%
the proper term for training in ideology
 
04:18:07.119 --> 04:18:08.990 align:start position:0%
the proper term for training in ideology
is

04:18:08.990 --> 04:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:18:11.349 --> 04:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
indoctrination while anybody may as is
 
04:18:13.950 --> 04:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
their right hold these views they do not
 
04:18:16.630 --> 04:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
have the right to force others to hold
 
04:18:16.640 --> 04:18:17.349 align:start position:0%
have the right to force others to hold
these

04:18:17.349 --> 04:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:18:19.670 --> 04:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
views they do not have the right to
 
04:18:22.389 --> 04:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
violate others freedoms of speech of
 
04:18:25.630 --> 04:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
Association or of religion by compelling
 
04:18:28.870 --> 04:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
others to pledge fty to their
 
04:18:28.880 --> 04:18:31.189 align:start position:0%
others to pledge fty to their
ideology

04:18:31.189 --> 04:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
ideology
 
04:18:34.750 --> 04:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
or the uh I'm sorry to make confessions
 
04:18:37.469 --> 04:18:37.479 align:start position:0%
to the sinfulness of their their skin
 
04:18:41.109 --> 04:18:41.119 align:start position:0%
color or for America at large make no
 
04:18:42.910 --> 04:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
mistake critical theory trainings are
 
04:18:45.630 --> 04:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
often segregated by skin color and
 
04:18:48.149 --> 04:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
indeed so is the content of these
 
04:18:50.429 --> 04:18:50.439 align:start position:0%
trainings while some segregated groups
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
are often made to confess their own
 
04:18:54.389 --> 04:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
racism other groups are taught of the
 
04:18:57.349 --> 04:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
evils of the other group here are a
 
04:18:58.830 --> 04:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
couple real world
 
04:19:01.269 --> 04:19:01.279 align:start position:0%
examples the US Department of Homeland
 
04:19:02.750 --> 04:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
Security hosted a training on
 
04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
microaggressions micro inequities and
 
04:19:08.149 --> 04:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
micro assaults where employees white
 
04:19:10.510 --> 04:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
employees only were told that they had
 
04:19:13.710 --> 04:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
been socialized into oppressor
 
04:19:16.149 --> 04:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
roles this indoctrination isn't limited
 
04:19:16.159 --> 04:19:17.870 align:start position:0%
roles this indoctrination isn't limited
to

04:19:17.870 --> 04:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:19:21.710 --> 04:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
workplaces in a recent Elementary School
 
04:19:24.910 --> 04:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
in copertino California forced a class
 
04:19:27.269 --> 04:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
of third graders to deconstruct their
 
04:19:30.870 --> 04:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
racial identities then rank themselves
 
04:19:33.990 --> 04:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
according to their power and privilege
 
04:19:36.149 --> 04:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
again they forc third graders to rank
 
04:19:38.590 --> 04:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
themselves B based on skin
 
04:19:40.950 --> 04:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
color there are countless more examples
 
04:19:44.590 --> 04:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
of this uh people having this ideology
 
04:19:47.109 --> 04:19:47.119 align:start position:0%
thrust upon them in both public and
 
04:19:49.550 --> 04:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
private sectors and Nationwide this
 
04:19:51.229 --> 04:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
ideology and specifically these types of
 
04:19:53.469 --> 04:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
trainings are rightly leading to
 
04:19:55.229 --> 04:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
lawsuits under the theory of hostile
 
04:19:55.239 --> 04:19:56.790 align:start position:0%
lawsuits under the theory of hostile
work

04:19:56.790 --> 04:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:19:59.429 --> 04:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
environment they may also be seen as
 
04:20:01.389 --> 04:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
violations of civil
 
04:20:03.950 --> 04:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
rights as such these indoctrinations in
 
04:20:05.910 --> 04:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are liable to put
 
04:20:07.950 --> 04:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
substantial sums of taxpayer money at
 
04:20:12.429 --> 04:20:12.439 align:start position:0%
risk through uh harassment of state
 
04:20:14.389 --> 04:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
employees it should be noted that the
 
04:20:16.870 --> 04:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
promotion of diversity and inclusion not
 
04:20:20.229 --> 04:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
rooted in critical theory is possible it
 
04:20:22.149 --> 04:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
is in keeping with America's liberal
 
04:20:24.830 --> 04:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
tradition and it's perfectly acceptable
 
04:20:26.790 --> 04:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
and this bill does nothing to prohibit
 
04:20:30.790 --> 04:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
this further the idea that there isn't
 
04:20:32.429 --> 04:20:32.439 align:start position:0%
already speech limitations in the
 
04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
workplace is false we already prohibit
 
04:20:38.309 --> 04:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
harassment based on sex based on race
 
04:20:41.950 --> 04:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
and based on gender this just clarifies
 
04:20:45.269 --> 04:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
that these sorts of trainings when
 
04:20:47.590 --> 04:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
directed at People based on critical
 
04:20:50.710 --> 04:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
theory are also forms of
 
04:20:52.750 --> 04:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
harassment um that's it thank you for
 
04:20:52.760 --> 04:20:53.910 align:start position:0%
harassment um that's it thank you for
your

04:20:53.910 --> 04:20:53.920 align:start position:0%

04:21:01.590 --> 04:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none you excuse thank

where in New Hampshire at any level
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
critical race tra training critical race
 
04:21:39.349 --> 04:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:40.830 --> 04:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire I'm not
 
04:21:42.469 --> 04:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
specifically aware of where it's being
 
04:21:44.830 --> 04:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
taught I do know these are commonly done
 
04:21:47.349 --> 04:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
in government trainings however as well
 
04:21:51.109 --> 04:21:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:54.189 --> 04:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
such thank you so you're not aware of
 
04:21:56.590 --> 04:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
are are you aware of have you done any
 
04:21:59.070 --> 04:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
study of New Hampshire with regard to
 
04:21:59.080 --> 04:22:01.309 align:start position:0%
study of New Hampshire with regard to
this

04:22:01.309 --> 04:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
subject not specifically in New
 
04:22:05.149 --> 04:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as far as where it's being
 
04:22:07.790 --> 04:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
taught here no I am aware of many other
 
04:22:09.309 --> 04:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
individual locations where it's being
 
04:22:11.790 --> 04:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
done the same exact
 
04:22:13.790 --> 04:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
Theory thank you that answers the
 
04:22:15.109 --> 04:22:15.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
04:22:18.189 --> 04:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
Mr any further
 
04:22:20.590 --> 04:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
questions okay now at this time of
 
04:22:22.550 --> 04:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
calling Aon kind
 
04:22:25.750 --> 04:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
check okay can you hear me yeah go ahead
 
04:22:28.269 --> 04:22:28.279 align:start position:0%
all right much of what I want to say uh
 
04:22:30.790 --> 04:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
first of all Aon pich I live at33
 
04:22:34.109 --> 04:22:34.119 align:start position:0%
downroad in Hollis um much of what I
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to say has already been
 
04:22:35.760 --> 04:22:59.950 align:start position:0%
wanted to say has already been
eloquently

04:22:59.950 --> 04:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:01.109 --> 04:23:01.119 align:start position:0%
all right can you still hear me
 
04:23:02.550 --> 04:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
something was happening with my zoom
 
04:23:04.950 --> 04:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
screen there start over again we're
 
04:23:07.630 --> 04:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
you're all set okay good so um so again
 
04:23:09.870 --> 04:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
Aron and Kasich I'm at 133 Dow Road in
 
04:23:12.710 --> 04:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
Hollis and uh uh much of what I wanted
 
04:23:14.349 --> 04:23:14.359 align:start position:0%
to say has already been eloquently
 
04:23:16.149 --> 04:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
presented to you so I'm not going to
 
04:23:18.189 --> 04:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
repeat it in the interest of time but I
 
04:23:21.590 --> 04:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
have just U four five quick little
 
04:23:25.790 --> 04:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
bullet points one is this bill HB 544
 
04:23:29.590 --> 04:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
which I'm speaking in favor of um if you
 
04:23:31.189 --> 04:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
if you read it and think about what all
 
04:23:32.870 --> 04:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
those points say in there it actually
 
04:23:32.880 --> 04:23:34.349 align:start position:0%
those points say in there it actually
supports

04:23:34.349 --> 04:23:34.359 align:start position:0%
supports
 
04:23:36.630 --> 04:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination right what it's a to
 
04:23:39.710 --> 04:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
do is to pre pre uh prevent critical
 
04:23:41.910 --> 04:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
race theory in the way the previous
 
04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
speaker just described as being shoved
 
04:23:46.630 --> 04:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
into our school system we don't have a
 
04:23:49.349 --> 04:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
problem with that in this area there are
 
04:23:51.510 --> 04:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
Pockets where I believe there are
 
04:23:53.710 --> 04:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
problems uh that some of the critical
 
04:23:55.830 --> 04:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
race Theory could be applicable in terms
 
04:23:58.030 --> 04:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
of solving them we don't have that
 
04:24:00.429 --> 04:24:00.439 align:start position:0%
problem here so you know this to me
 
04:24:02.189 --> 04:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
boils down to are we going to waste tax
 
04:24:04.349 --> 04:24:04.359 align:start position:0%
dollars on something like this to solve
 
04:24:07.950 --> 04:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
a problem that doesn't exist
 
04:24:11.630 --> 04:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
um secondly is the critical race Theory
 
04:24:13.229 --> 04:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
that's being proposed and implemented
 
04:24:14.469 --> 04:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
around the country as we've already
 
04:24:16.349 --> 04:24:16.359 align:start position:0%
heard as well and I I won't talk much
 
04:24:18.349 --> 04:24:18.359 align:start position:0%
about it promotes
 
04:24:20.790 --> 04:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
divisiveness and that's the exact exact
 
04:24:22.950 --> 04:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
opposite of what we want to do in our
 
04:24:25.229 --> 04:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
school systems the Educators should be
 
04:24:27.990 --> 04:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
teaching math science English
 
04:24:31.990 --> 04:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
non-revision revisionist History
 
04:24:33.710 --> 04:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
government that's what they should be
 
04:24:35.710 --> 04:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
doing that's what we pay them to do with
 
04:24:38.109 --> 04:24:38.119 align:start position:0%
our tax schols they should be teaching
 
04:24:40.710 --> 04:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
how to think not what to think if
 
04:24:42.070 --> 04:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
they're teaching what to think they have
 
04:24:43.750 --> 04:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
failed as
 
04:24:46.510 --> 04:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
Educators and that's all I have for
 
04:24:51.429 --> 04:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:54.630 --> 04:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
questions there be none um Witnesses
 
04:24:57.189 --> 04:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
excuse thank you for your testimony I'm
 
04:25:00.189 --> 04:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
going to call on please forgive me if I
 
04:25:02.910 --> 04:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
put you your name Asma

elone you have to
unmute

04:25:13.950 --> 04:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:16.070 --> 04:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me yes we do thank
 
04:25:19.429 --> 04:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
you yeah hi uh my name is Asma aluni and
 
04:25:22.389 --> 04:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
I am speaking against this bill very
 
04:25:26.109 --> 04:25:26.119 align:start position:0%
strongly um because we cannot as a state
 
04:25:28.229 --> 04:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
expect to work towards achieving
 
04:25:31.109 --> 04:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
equality without first acknowledging and
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
addressing the biases that are deeply
 
04:25:36.670 --> 04:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
rooted in the fabric of ourselves
 
04:25:39.750 --> 04:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
our communities our state and our nation
 
04:25:42.670 --> 04:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
right unconscious racism is real I am a
 
04:25:45.750 --> 04:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
woman of color who is Muslim and wears
 
04:25:48.030 --> 04:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
hijab I have been to schools
 
04:25:50.429 --> 04:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
organizations and churches and college
 
04:25:52.990 --> 04:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
classrooms to share how people like me
 
04:25:55.670 --> 04:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
are targeted in our experiences with
 
04:25:58.590 --> 04:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
racism in this country for example the
 
04:26:00.630 --> 04:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
fact that there has been research that
 
04:26:03.550 --> 04:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
documents that Arabs and Muslims are
 
04:26:06.389 --> 04:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly negatively portrayed in
 
04:26:09.349 --> 04:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
media and oftentimes targeted under the
 
04:26:12.309 --> 04:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
security apparatus right overwhelmingly
 
04:26:14.510 --> 04:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
images of us are negative and
 
04:26:16.710 --> 04:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
stereotypical in nature like being
 
04:26:19.830 --> 04:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
violent or that women are submissive or
 
04:26:22.189 --> 04:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
oppressed this is not only in the media
 
04:26:24.630 --> 04:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
but it's also in education and the
 
04:26:27.510 --> 04:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Homeland Security with the
 
04:26:29.710 --> 04:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
the um targeting of innocent Arabs and
 
04:26:31.630 --> 04:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
Muslims through surveillance being
 
04:26:34.109 --> 04:26:34.119 align:start position:0%
arrested without given due process are
 
04:26:35.990 --> 04:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
all examples of how certain groups
 
04:26:39.349 --> 04:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
groups of people experience racism today
 
04:26:42.389 --> 04:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
and in this bill it clearly states um
 
04:26:43.590 --> 04:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
there's a line in there that
 
04:26:45.590 --> 04:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
divisiveness is saying that New
 
04:26:47.429 --> 04:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or the United States is
 
04:26:51.149 --> 04:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
inherently um racist when I share ways
 
04:26:53.389 --> 04:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
people like me experience racism it
 
04:26:55.990 --> 04:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
creates a space for something to be done
 
04:26:57.990 --> 04:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
about it and for people to learn how
 
04:27:00.870 --> 04:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
their actions can be racist we're human
 
04:27:03.309 --> 04:27:03.319 align:start position:0%
we learn and we do better I can tell
 
04:27:05.750 --> 04:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
that together we can do something about
 
04:27:07.990 --> 04:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
it because when we're not actively
 
04:27:10.389 --> 04:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
fighting racism in ourselves and in our
 
04:27:12.990 --> 04:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
society racism will continue and will
 
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
continue to harm our Our Lives yes
 
04:27:17.830 --> 04:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
people sticking their middle finger at
 
04:27:19.910 --> 04:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
me when I do nothing but walk down the
 
04:27:22.109 --> 04:27:22.119 align:start position:0%
street that's bad but also when my
 
04:27:24.349 --> 04:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
family is banned from coming to the US
 
04:27:26.109 --> 04:27:26.119 align:start position:0%
right through the Muslim ban that is
 
04:27:29.510 --> 04:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
also racism racism is institutionalized
 
04:27:31.710 --> 04:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
as well so when I'm pulled aside at the
 
04:27:33.910 --> 04:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
airport and get checked for bomb
 
04:27:37.389 --> 04:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
material right um just to make sure that
 
04:27:39.149 --> 04:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not violent or whatever
 
04:27:41.510 --> 04:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's institutionalized racism I have a
 
04:27:43.510 --> 04:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
right to call it out when Arabs and
 
04:27:45.910 --> 04:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
Muslims are targeted by the FBI for
 
04:27:47.790 --> 04:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
surveillance and forc to spy in our
 
04:27:50.309 --> 04:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
communities or lose immigrant status
 
04:27:52.590 --> 04:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
that is institutionalized racism and I
 
04:27:54.630 --> 04:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
have a right to call it out so yes
 
04:27:56.630 --> 04:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
people telling me to go back home I
 
04:27:59.189 --> 04:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
don't belong here does hurt me but it's
 
04:28:01.830 --> 04:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
it's only because things that our our
 
04:28:04.870 --> 04:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
government our institutions also promote
 
04:28:06.550 --> 04:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
that allows these things to happen
 
04:28:08.710 --> 04:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
through movies through the media right
 
04:28:11.309 --> 04:28:11.319 align:start position:0%
these negative images of people like us
 
04:28:13.229 --> 04:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
people like me and so many other people
 
04:28:15.070 --> 04:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
of color go through racism in this
 
04:28:17.590 --> 04:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
country and we must as a nation address
 
04:28:20.030 --> 04:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
racism and classism and sexism and
 
04:28:22.590 --> 04:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
ableism so that many other things can
 
04:28:25.149 --> 04:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
stop that are dividing our nation under
 
04:28:26.830 --> 04:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
this bill no one would be able to
 
04:28:28.910 --> 04:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
benefit in making the connections of the
 
04:28:31.389 --> 04:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
historical and modern forms of racism
 
04:28:33.950 --> 04:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
that continue to plague our communities
 
04:28:36.469 --> 04:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
for representative jasf Osborne who who
 
04:28:38.510 --> 04:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
introduced this if you hear this I want
 
04:28:40.910 --> 04:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
to say to you that our experiences are
 
04:28:43.469 --> 04:28:43.479 align:start position:0%
very real they may not be true for you
 
04:28:45.670 --> 04:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
because they do not happen to you but
 
04:28:47.950 --> 04:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
know that racism is alive and true for
 
04:28:50.550 --> 04:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
us and that it is institutionalized to
 
04:28:54.030 --> 04:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
call it divisive to name our experiences
 
04:28:56.030 --> 04:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
um is to ignore the fact that what is
 
04:28:58.149 --> 04:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
really divisive is the continuation of
 
04:29:01.189 --> 04:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
racism and classism and sexism we must
 
04:29:03.630 --> 04:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
come together as a people black white
 
04:29:06.189 --> 04:29:06.199 align:start position:0%
brown all of us to be able to name what
 
04:29:08.349 --> 04:29:08.359 align:start position:0%
is happening in our communities so that
 
04:29:10.510 --> 04:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
we can come together and dismantle all
 
04:29:12.990 --> 04:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
these oppressive systems that plague our
 
04:29:14.710 --> 04:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
communities and we want to be able to
 
04:29:17.189 --> 04:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
dismantle that together so this bill
 
04:29:19.710 --> 04:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
undermines that effort to Foster
 
04:29:22.109 --> 04:29:22.119 align:start position:0%
diversity and inclusion and it must be
 
04:29:26.429 --> 04:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
stopped at all costs please do itl this
 
04:29:29.750 --> 04:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
bill um thank you for your testimony um
 
04:29:32.189 --> 04:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
representative leakas has a question um
 
04:29:33.950 --> 04:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:29:36.429 --> 04:29:36.439 align:start position:0%
question um
 
04:29:38.750 --> 04:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
what I'm wondering is given um the part
 
04:29:40.309 --> 04:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
at the end of the bill General
 
04:29:43.070 --> 04:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
Provisions especially part one and two
 
04:29:44.790 --> 04:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
um what is there in this bill that would
 
04:29:47.750 --> 04:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
present prevent you from you know
 
04:29:50.429 --> 04:29:50.439 align:start position:0%
talking about um including in schools
 
04:29:52.630 --> 04:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
your experiences and similar experiences
 
04:29:54.670 --> 04:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
that other people have had and talking
 
04:29:56.469 --> 04:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
about clearly yes thank you
 
04:29:58.990 --> 04:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
representative clearly the the bill
 
04:30:00.870 --> 04:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
itself if you look there is language
 
04:30:03.349 --> 04:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
that can be used it looks all pretty
 
04:30:05.189 --> 04:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
it's wrapped up in beautiful cloth but
 
04:30:07.510 --> 04:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
it is a dangerous bill because there is
 
04:30:10.229 --> 04:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
language in there that can stop people
 
04:30:12.149 --> 04:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
from allowing me to say we have an
 
04:30:14.950 --> 04:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
inherently racist Society we we need to
 
04:30:16.910 --> 04:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
work on that and that's the problem with
 
04:30:19.189 --> 04:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
this bill it looks all nice but there
 
04:30:22.429 --> 04:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
are things that can cause really serious
 
04:30:24.510 --> 04:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
even against our constitution you know
 
04:30:26.389 --> 04:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
we have a right to free speech we have a
 
04:30:27.950 --> 04:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
right to name what's happening in our
 
04:30:30.109 --> 04:30:30.119 align:start position:0%
communities and this is going to be used
 
04:30:32.109 --> 04:30:32.119 align:start position:0%
against us this is not the way we need
 
04:30:34.790 --> 04:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
to be moving as a society and we clearly
 
04:30:37.309 --> 04:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
know why bills like this are are being
 
04:30:39.349 --> 04:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
introduced we know that Trump introduced
 
04:30:41.670 --> 04:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
it so I I don't think I need to say
 
04:30:43.830 --> 04:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
anymore this is a dangerous
 
04:30:46.349 --> 04:30:46.359 align:start position:0%
bill um I I'd question you against
 
04:30:47.990 --> 04:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
assuming the motives of people that have
 
04:30:49.510 --> 04:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
put the bill in or support it but thank
 
04:30:51.950 --> 04:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
04:30:55.189 --> 04:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
answer um represent
 
04:30:58.469 --> 04:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
Schulz thank you Mr chair U Miss El
 
04:31:00.349 --> 04:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
honeyi I I want I hope I pronounced your
 
04:31:03.349 --> 04:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
name correctly um I I want to make sure
 
04:31:05.830 --> 04:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
I understand you correctly because I I
 
04:31:08.710 --> 04:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
hear you say that you're an expert in
 
04:31:12.109 --> 04:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
presenting on these topics so are you
 
04:31:14.990 --> 04:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
saying that it is helpful to
 
04:31:18.189 --> 04:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
dispelling um I guess bigotry if we want
 
04:31:20.229 --> 04:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
to group all of them together that it's
 
04:31:22.670 --> 04:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
helpful to point out
 
04:31:25.750 --> 04:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
differences and does pointing out are
 
04:31:27.990 --> 04:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
you saying that pointing out these
 
04:31:31.149 --> 04:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
differences isn't racist and helps us
 
04:31:31.159 --> 04:31:32.870 align:start position:0%
differences isn't racist and helps us
diffuse

04:31:32.870 --> 04:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
diffuse
 
04:31:35.269 --> 04:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
racism yes representative Schultz you
 
04:31:37.510 --> 04:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
are absolutely correct when I'm saying
 
04:31:40.030 --> 04:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
that it is important to name how
 
04:31:42.870 --> 04:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
different communities are facing or
 
04:31:45.030 --> 04:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
moving about in our communities and to
 
04:31:47.750 --> 04:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
stop racism racism we have to be able to
 
04:31:51.189 --> 04:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
name it so yes in order to end racism we
 
04:31:52.990 --> 04:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
have to be able to say this is the way
 
04:31:56.389 --> 04:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
we're treated differently and so um yes
 
04:31:58.590 --> 04:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely we must actually name the
 
04:32:00.950 --> 04:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
difference so that we can fix it so that
 
04:32:03.070 --> 04:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
we can live in a more Equitable Society
 
04:32:04.349 --> 04:32:04.359 align:start position:0%
but people want to shut that
 
04:32:06.630 --> 04:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
conversation down and want to say
 
04:32:08.950 --> 04:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
whenever we want to talk about the ways
 
04:32:11.030 --> 04:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
that we are being harmed as as being
 
04:32:13.269 --> 04:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
divisive the divisiveness is to our
 
04:32:15.349 --> 04:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
lives what we've been facing that's
 
04:32:16.990 --> 04:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
divisive we need to come together as a
 
04:32:18.670 --> 04:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
community and say together we're going
 
04:32:22.830 --> 04:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
to fight this thank
 
04:32:27.149 --> 04:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:33.630 --> 04:32:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:36.149 --> 04:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm now going to call call on
 
04:32:41.950 --> 04:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:45.550 --> 04:32:45.560 align:start position:0%
Spot hello thank you good afternoon uh
 
04:32:46.870 --> 04:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
and again thank you for the opportunity
 
04:32:49.910 --> 04:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
to speak my name is James bomersbach I
 
04:32:52.149 --> 04:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
am a licensed psychologist a resident of
 
04:32:53.630 --> 04:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the chair of the
 
04:32:55.229 --> 04:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
legislative committee for the New
 
04:32:57.469 --> 04:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Psychological Association the
 
04:32:59.990 --> 04:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
organization represents psychologists in
 
04:33:00.000 --> 04:33:00.750 align:start position:0%
organization represents psychologists in
the

04:33:00.750 --> 04:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:33:03.469 --> 04:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
state um I want to offer the following
 
04:33:04.470 --> 04:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
testimony and hopes that it will
 
04:33:06.349 --> 04:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
convince the committee to reject this
 
04:33:08.670 --> 04:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
bill uh the requirements and assertions
 
04:33:10.910 --> 04:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
set forth in this bill are out of line
 
04:33:12.629 --> 04:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
with current psychological theories on
 
04:33:16.349 --> 04:33:16.359 align:start position:0%
racism sexism bias and discrimination uh
 
04:33:17.910 --> 04:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
the bill would serve to reinforce
 
04:33:20.310 --> 04:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
harmful social structures while claiming
 
04:33:22.869 --> 04:33:22.879 align:start position:0%
to do the exact opposite psychologists
 
04:33:25.189 --> 04:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
strive to adhere to to a professional
 
04:33:27.789 --> 04:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
code of ethics and to advocate for those
 
04:33:30.070 --> 04:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
ethical principles when doing so would
 
04:33:32.470 --> 04:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
Aid the mental health of others that is
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
what I hope to represent here
 
04:33:37.310 --> 04:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
today in talking about race and gender
 
04:33:39.029 --> 04:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
it is important to differentiate between
 
04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
the goals to which we as a society
 
04:33:45.070 --> 04:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
Aspire and the reality in which we live
 
04:33:47.070 --> 04:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
this bill's language appears to push
 
04:33:49.189 --> 04:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
people away from propagating racist
 
04:33:52.429 --> 04:33:52.439 align:start position:0%
beliefs a noble Pursuit uh however it
 
04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
would also prevent discussion of real
 
04:33:57.390 --> 04:33:57.400 align:start position:0%
and ongoing problems in our society
 
04:33:59.269 --> 04:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
let's take the examples which
 
04:34:01.590 --> 04:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
are within the bill although not
 
04:34:04.629 --> 04:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
expressly referenced um of white
 
04:34:07.070 --> 04:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
privilege and male privilege now
 
04:34:09.029 --> 04:34:09.039 align:start position:0%
privilege is the phenomenon whereby
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
individuals of certain racial
 
04:34:14.310 --> 04:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
backgrounds or certain genders uh have
 
04:34:15.910 --> 04:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
benefits that are afforded to them in
 
04:34:18.070 --> 04:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
society that are not afforded to others
 
04:34:19.429 --> 04:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
who lack that
 
04:34:22.629 --> 04:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
privilege uh a part of the challenge of
 
04:34:24.789 --> 04:34:24.799 align:start position:0%
discussing and overcoming privilege uh
 
04:34:26.269 --> 04:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
is that there may be those people who
 
04:34:29.470 --> 04:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
have privilege who assume that this is
 
04:34:31.109 --> 04:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
true for everyone that they can that
 
04:34:33.551 --> 04:34:33.561 align:start position:0%
everyone has these privileges um rather
 
04:34:34.910 --> 04:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
than recognizing that as something that
 
04:34:36.750 --> 04:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
has been granted them because of
 
04:34:38.789 --> 04:34:38.799 align:start position:0%
qualities of their birth rather than
 
04:34:41.070 --> 04:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
qualities of their
 
04:34:44.189 --> 04:34:44.199 align:start position:0%
character uh in truth examples of white
 
04:34:45.750 --> 04:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
privilege and male privilege are
 
04:34:47.990 --> 04:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
consistently identified in social
 
04:34:50.709 --> 04:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
science research uh examples include
 
04:34:53.109 --> 04:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
disparities in evaluations of homes uh
 
04:34:54.789 --> 04:34:54.799 align:start position:0%
in selection or rejection of job
 
04:34:56.869 --> 04:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
applications in treatment within Health
 
04:34:59.070 --> 04:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
Care settings and perhaps most visibly
 
04:35:01.150 --> 04:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
in recent years in responses from law
 
04:35:04.189 --> 04:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement and criminal justice
 
04:35:04.199 --> 04:35:05.990 align:start position:0%
enforcement and criminal justice
agencies

04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
04:35:09.189 --> 04:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
now an important part of the process of
 
04:35:11.750 --> 04:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
dismantling privilege is honest
 
04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
recognition of its influences on all of
 
04:35:15.670 --> 04:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
our lives and how it has aided
 
04:35:17.709 --> 04:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
individuals who have privilege and how
 
04:35:20.349 --> 04:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
it has harmed those who do not
 
04:35:22.590 --> 04:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately all too often people can
 
04:35:24.789 --> 04:35:24.799 align:start position:0%
become defensive when confronted with
 
04:35:26.070 --> 04:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
the reality that they have benefited
 
04:35:28.070 --> 04:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
from privilege especially when they
 
04:35:29.510 --> 04:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
might not even recognize that they have
 
04:35:32.109 --> 04:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
that privilege in the first place uh
 
04:35:34.551 --> 04:35:34.561 align:start position:0%
they may deny that privilege is real and
 
04:35:37.670 --> 04:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
that it is ultim Ely harmful to everyone
 
04:35:39.510 --> 04:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
discussion and training about privilege
 
04:35:42.070 --> 04:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
and other so-called divisive Concepts is
 
04:35:44.109 --> 04:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
therefore not about advocating for race
 
04:35:47.189 --> 04:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
or gender biases as some would suggest
 
04:35:49.551 --> 04:35:49.561 align:start position:0%
um it is instead about recognition and
 
04:35:51.230 --> 04:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
helping others recognize that these
 
04:35:53.470 --> 04:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
biases still exist throughout our
 
04:35:56.109 --> 04:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
society a law that would prevent open
 
04:35:57.910 --> 04:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
and free discussion of privilege and
 
04:36:00.390 --> 04:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
bias would only serve to maintain the
 
04:36:03.349 --> 04:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
existences of these biases we must not
 
04:36:05.349 --> 04:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
diminish the lived experiences of those
 
04:36:08.230 --> 04:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
who have been harmed by privilege we
 
04:36:10.029 --> 04:36:10.039 align:start position:0%
must not build barriers that could
 
04:36:13.590 --> 04:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:15.990 --> 04:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
help uh this bill also includes
 
04:36:17.269 --> 04:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
discussion of
 
04:36:20.269 --> 04:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
scapegoating uh you know this is my BR
 
04:36:21.789 --> 04:36:21.799 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm going to just move ahead a
 
04:36:23.869 --> 04:36:23.879 align:start position:0%
little bit here for the sake of
 
04:36:25.910 --> 04:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
time but I would encourage all of you to
 
04:36:27.629 --> 04:36:27.639 align:start position:0%
read the the remainder of my testimony
 
04:36:29.869 --> 04:36:29.879 align:start position:0%
I'll finish with this as psychologists
 
04:36:32.070 --> 04:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
we recognize that we have a duty to
 
04:36:33.910 --> 04:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
recognize the importance of advocating
 
04:36:35.789 --> 04:36:35.799 align:start position:0%
for justice and for respect for people's
 
04:36:38.470 --> 04:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
rights and dignity we recognize that
 
04:36:40.310 --> 04:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
social institutions in the United States
 
04:36:42.070 --> 04:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
and in New Hampshire have a historical
 
04:36:43.349 --> 04:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
record of treating individuals
 
04:36:45.990 --> 04:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
differently based on race gender and
 
04:36:48.510 --> 04:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
other personal characteristics as a
 
04:36:50.470 --> 04:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
society we have progressed toward a more
 
04:36:52.709 --> 04:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
equal and free Society however we
 
04:36:54.150 --> 04:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
recognize that this effort is not
 
04:36:56.429 --> 04:36:56.439 align:start position:0%
complete and we must always continue to
 
04:36:58.709 --> 04:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
work towards our guiding principles
 
04:37:00.551 --> 04:37:00.561 align:start position:0%
limiting discussion of controversial
 
04:37:03.109 --> 04:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
topics and treating racism and sexism as
 
04:37:05.709 --> 04:37:05.719 align:start position:0%
relics of a past age only serve to
 
04:37:08.551 --> 04:37:08.561 align:start position:0%
prevent us from making further progress
 
04:37:10.470 --> 04:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
therefore I strongly urge each Committee
 
04:37:13.029 --> 04:37:13.039 align:start position:0%
Member to vote down this proposal I
 
04:37:14.390 --> 04:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
would hope that the discussion today
 
04:37:15.789 --> 04:37:15.799 align:start position:0%
would encourage each of us to further
 
04:37:18.150 --> 04:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
explore our own experiences with race
 
04:37:20.349 --> 04:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
and sex-based discrimination and to lead
 
04:37:22.189 --> 04:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
us to ask ourselves what more we can do
 
04:37:24.789 --> 04:37:24.799 align:start position:0%
to overcome them thank
 
04:37:30.029 --> 04:37:30.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:33.269 --> 04:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:37:35.910 --> 04:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
Mr bmers back
 
04:37:37.869 --> 04:37:37.879 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things we
 
04:37:40.269 --> 04:37:40.279 align:start position:0%
are receiving on this committee is a lot
 
04:37:42.869 --> 04:37:42.879 align:start position:0%
of emails from parents who are very
 
04:37:45.269 --> 04:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
concerned about things that their
 
04:37:48.269 --> 04:37:48.279 align:start position:0%
children are being taught I'm wondering
 
04:37:51.269 --> 04:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
whether you're personally involved with
 
04:37:54.189 --> 04:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
or your Association is involved with
 
04:37:57.789 --> 04:37:57.799 align:start position:0%
counseling for school systems which are
 
04:38:01.109 --> 04:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
attempting to address
 
04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
actual cultural and
 
04:38:03.920 --> 04:38:05.510 align:start position:0%
actual cultural and
historical

04:38:05.510 --> 04:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
historical
 
04:38:07.910 --> 04:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
phenomena in this state I'm not
 
04:38:11.470 --> 04:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about other states this state
 
04:38:13.830 --> 04:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
um that
 
04:38:20.869 --> 04:38:20.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
trying of others of being non-racist and
 
04:38:28.510 --> 04:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
non judgmental and so
 
04:38:32.470 --> 04:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
forth are you involved with attempting
 
04:38:36.349 --> 04:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
to assist school systems in designing
 
04:38:40.310 --> 04:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
programs that will be effective in and
 
04:38:43.150 --> 04:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
not just leaving it up to the teachers
 
04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh ideas or but giving them expert
 
04:38:49.390 --> 04:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
background training so that they teach
 
04:38:54.070 --> 04:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
well and and and are beneficial to their
 
04:38:56.910 --> 04:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
students thank you for the question I
 
04:38:59.670 --> 04:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
must say I am not personally um familiar
 
04:39:01.470 --> 04:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
with being I'm not able to answer that
 
04:39:02.949 --> 04:39:02.959 align:start position:0%
question for you today although I will
 
04:39:05.429 --> 04:39:05.439 align:start position:0%

response more specifically uh I'm not
 
04:39:13.109 --> 04:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
aware of any psychologists in in the
 
04:39:14.189 --> 04:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
state who
 
04:39:14.199 --> 04:39:16.429 align:start position:0%
state who
are

04:39:16.429 --> 04:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:39:19.510 --> 04:39:19.520 align:start position:0%

04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
psychologist I know that they exist I
 
04:39:22.949 --> 04:39:22.959 align:start position:0%
just had an opportunity to speak with

them on this matter um so I'd have to
 
04:39:26.390 --> 04:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
find some more information and get back
 
04:39:29.470 --> 04:39:29.480 align:start position:0%

personal clients patients who uh have
 
04:39:45.310 --> 04:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
approached you uh because their
 
04:39:48.670 --> 04:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
children um or perhaps they brought in a
 
04:39:50.948 --> 04:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
child who has been confronted in the
 
04:39:50.958 --> 04:39:52.030 align:start position:0%
child who has been confronted in the
school

04:39:52.030 --> 04:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:39:57.788 --> 04:39:57.798 align:start position:0%
systems uh with uh teaching that they
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
found uh harmful or threatening or
 
04:40:05.230 --> 04:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
disorienting uh because the parents that
 
04:40:07.070 --> 04:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
are writing to us are very concerned
 
04:40:09.670 --> 04:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
about they the the ones that mention
 
04:40:11.310 --> 04:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
anything they mention critical race
 
04:40:14.070 --> 04:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
theory is this being taught or used
 
04:40:17.550 --> 04:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:20.350 --> 04:40:20.360 align:start position:0%

all whites are quote unquote fragile due
 
04:43:39.550 --> 04:43:39.560 align:start position:0%

trainings have been conducted for months
 
04:44:03.510 --> 04:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
I'm told partially funded by state
 
04:44:06.868 --> 04:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
grants for for all teachers faculty and
 
04:44:09.030 --> 04:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
staff my opinion these kinds of
 
04:44:10.708 --> 04:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
teachings and trainings are as
 
04:44:13.310 --> 04:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
objectionable as they are false
 
04:44:16.948 --> 04:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
inflammatory and yes racist they have no
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
place in our New Hampshire schools and
 
04:44:19.628 --> 04:44:19.638 align:start position:0%
in the training programs of New
 
04:44:22.030 --> 04:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire companies I'd like to conclude
 
04:44:23.350 --> 04:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
by saying I'm the son of a marine
 
04:44:25.510 --> 04:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
veteran my grandfather and several great
 
04:44:27.230 --> 04:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
unes served in the armed forces and
 
04:44:29.510 --> 04:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
fought the access during World War II
 
04:44:31.470 --> 04:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
some of my ancestors were rounded up
 
04:44:34.750 --> 04:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
sent to camps and exterminated my family
 
04:44:36.750 --> 04:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
knows what racism and white supremacy
 
04:44:39.590 --> 04:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
looks like we fought and we have died to
 
04:44:41.150 --> 04:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
defend the United States and the
 
04:44:43.030 --> 04:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
egalitarian principles for which it
 
04:44:45.788 --> 04:44:45.798 align:start position:0%
stands it is sad commentary about our
 
04:44:48.948 --> 04:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
times that we need House Bill 544 but
 
04:44:52.070 --> 04:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
the reality is we do our children
 
04:44:53.550 --> 04:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
deserve to be taught the history of this
 
04:44:56.030 --> 04:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
nation for all of its greatness and all
 
04:44:58.430 --> 04:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
of its flaws they do not deserve to be
 
04:45:00.310 --> 04:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
indoctrinated with hatred not only of
 
04:45:02.628 --> 04:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
themselves but also of those who choose
 
04:45:04.868 --> 04:45:04.878 align:start position:0%
to love this country
 
04:45:07.628 --> 04:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
I humbly request you pass House Bill 544
 
04:45:09.750 --> 04:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
so I can send my kids to school free
 
04:45:12.788 --> 04:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
from racism discrimination and racial
 
04:45:19.110 --> 04:45:19.120 align:start position:0%

Moore
 
04:46:06.910 --> 04:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
question of the chair while we're
 
04:46:09.948 --> 04:46:09.958 align:start position:0%
waiting I was I had my hand up to ask
 
04:46:14.510 --> 04:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:16.868 --> 04:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
question he's still here ask your
 
04:46:19.708 --> 04:46:19.718 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair um I'll
 
04:46:23.510 --> 04:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
be brief I found that uh those questions
 
04:46:25.788 --> 04:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
that you read I found that interesting
 
04:46:28.110 --> 04:46:28.120 align:start position:0%
so the one by the way I'm also the child
 
04:46:31.868 --> 04:46:31.878 align:start position:0%
of a marine so yay love that um that's
 
04:46:34.310 --> 04:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
irrelevant though to today but um my
 
04:46:36.110 --> 04:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
question is so with that questionnaire
 
04:46:37.708 --> 04:46:37.718 align:start position:0%
you said you were going to send it to us
 
04:46:39.910 --> 04:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's great I want to see it did you
 
04:46:43.230 --> 04:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
ask at least in the first one did you
 
04:46:46.310 --> 04:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
ask why they felt that the indeep uh
 
04:46:48.430 --> 04:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence was a sign
 
04:46:48.440 --> 04:46:49.230 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence was a sign
of

04:46:49.230 --> 04:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:46:52.310 --> 04:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
racism to help understand why that might
 
04:46:56.230 --> 04:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
be a moment that can be uh a teachable
 
04:46:58.628 --> 04:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
moment you could
 
04:47:02.310 --> 04:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
say uh Well ma'am the uh document that I
 
04:47:03.230 --> 04:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
referred to is actually not a
 
04:47:05.030 --> 04:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
questionnaire it's actually the syllabus
 
04:47:08.670 --> 04:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
for the course oh that yeah so it's so
 
04:47:10.548 --> 04:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
it's not a questionnaire it's a syllabus
 
04:47:12.190 --> 04:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
and that is one of the documents the
 
04:47:13.590 --> 04:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
quiz is one of the documents that was
 
04:47:15.350 --> 04:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
actually used in the
 
04:47:17.830 --> 04:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
course because I had this conversation
 
04:47:20.510 --> 04:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
myself and it was Illuminating to me to
 
04:47:23.430 --> 04:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
hear from an African-American why the
 
04:47:25.110 --> 04:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence in
 
04:47:27.270 --> 04:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
celebrating the 4th of July could be
 
04:47:31.510 --> 04:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to a descendant of slaves so
 
04:47:33.190 --> 04:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
anyway just throwing that out there but
 
04:47:38.470 --> 04:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:38.480 --> 04:47:46.948 align:start position:0%
 
ma'am

04:47:46.948 --> 04:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:50.670 --> 04:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:55.270 --> 04:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:57.948 --> 04:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
yourself I did not have a question I am
 
04:48:00.548 --> 04:48:00.558 align:start position:0%
listening in today because I am looking
 
04:48:02.590 --> 04:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
to move to New Hampshire and so this is
 
04:48:05.150 --> 04:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
seriously concerning to my S as an
 
04:48:07.350 --> 04:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
African-American woman and as a woman
 
04:48:11.030 --> 04:48:11.040 align:start position:0%

04:48:31.910 --> 04:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
concern sorry I had to step
 
04:48:36.310 --> 04:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:39.708 --> 04:48:39.718 align:start position:0%

difficulties I can some of the witnesses
 
04:48:46.430 --> 04:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
I can hardly even hear anything that
 
04:48:48.430 --> 04:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
they're saying is this problem being
 
04:48:48.440 --> 04:48:49.628 align:start position:0%
they're saying is this problem being
worked

04:48:49.628 --> 04:48:49.638 align:start position:0%
worked
 
04:48:52.910 --> 04:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
on is anyone else having this
 
04:48:56.110 --> 04:48:56.120 align:start position:0%
problem no no
 
04:48:58.628 --> 04:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
I you may have a weak internet
 
04:49:01.628 --> 04:49:01.638 align:start position:0%
connection or you might have a u your
 
04:49:07.590 --> 04:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:09.750 --> 04:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's not a volume issue it's a
 
04:49:09.760 --> 04:49:13.310 align:start position:0%
it's not a volume issue it's a
distortion

04:49:13.310 --> 04:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:13.320 --> 04:49:14.948 align:start position:0%
 
issue

04:49:14.948 --> 04:49:14.958 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:49:18.910 --> 04:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
T um fine Madam chair I will say there
 
04:49:21.948 --> 04:49:21.958 align:start position:0%

time to time their uh speeches have been
 
04:49:25.360 --> 04:49:28.948 align:start position:0%
time to time their uh speeches have been
broken

04:49:28.948 --> 04:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:34.628 --> 04:49:34.638 align:start position:0%
up that no doubt happens all right
 
04:49:41.670 --> 04:49:41.680 align:start position:0%

Madame chair and the members uh of this
 
04:49:57.590 --> 04:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
committee my name is jel B I'm the legal
 
04:50:00.150 --> 04:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
director uh for the ACLU of New
 
04:50:03.230 --> 04:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we oppose this bill I did
 
04:50:05.590 --> 04:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
submit some testimony um earlier this
 
04:50:09.948 --> 04:50:09.958 align:start position:0%
morning um on why we oppose this bill uh
 
04:50:12.548 --> 04:50:12.558 align:start position:0%
and I just want to make two brief points
 
04:50:14.430 --> 04:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
um the first
 
04:50:19.990 --> 04:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
is that uh this bill uh if enacted would
 
04:50:22.868 --> 04:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
likely bar the implementation of some of
 
04:50:24.788 --> 04:50:24.798 align:start position:0%
the recommendations made by the C the
 
04:50:26.788 --> 04:50:26.798 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on law enforcement
 
04:50:28.708 --> 04:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
accountability community and
 
04:50:30.628 --> 04:50:30.638 align:start position:0%
transparency so I just wanted to flag
 
04:50:32.990 --> 04:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
that that's highlighted in more detail
 
04:50:35.470 --> 04:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
in our testimony and the specific
 
04:50:37.470 --> 04:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations that would be negatively
 
04:50:40.990 --> 04:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
impacted by this bill um and the second
 
04:50:43.590 --> 04:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
point that I wanted to make um just has
 
04:50:47.830 --> 04:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
to do with the constitutionality um of
 
04:50:51.070 --> 04:50:51.080 align:start position:0%
uh HB 544 this bill in my view violates
 
04:50:54.230 --> 04:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment uh now to be clear I
 
04:50:58.030 --> 04:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
I personally um strongly uh believe that
 
04:51:00.230 --> 04:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
systemic racism exists in our society
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
but I you know I recognize from this
 
04:51:04.150 --> 04:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
hearing today that many dis agree with
 
04:51:07.190 --> 04:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
me and that's okay uh that difference of
 
04:51:09.548 --> 04:51:09.558 align:start position:0%
opinion and the debate around it is I
 
04:51:12.510 --> 04:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
really think the Hallmark of American
 
04:51:14.350 --> 04:51:14.360 align:start position:0%
democracy and the first amendment
 
04:51:15.750 --> 04:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
protects that difference of opinion
 
04:51:18.270 --> 04:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
where the government I don't think um
 
04:51:19.788 --> 04:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
should have the power to tell
 
04:51:22.110 --> 04:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
individuals and in this case State
 
04:51:25.190 --> 04:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
contractors how they should speak within
 
04:51:28.150 --> 04:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
their companies and that is why I
 
04:51:30.868 --> 04:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
believe this bill is problematic I think
 
04:51:32.868 --> 04:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
this bill is unconstitutional because it
 
04:51:35.470 --> 04:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
requires every single individual or
 
04:51:38.548 --> 04:51:38.558 align:start position:0%
company that enters into a state
 
04:51:41.750 --> 04:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
contract uh in the future to not provide
 
04:51:44.390 --> 04:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
trainings on these types of issues even
 
04:51:48.548 --> 04:51:48.558 align:start position:0%
on the contractor's own time and even on
 
04:51:52.390 --> 04:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
their own dime using their uh own money
 
04:51:54.350 --> 04:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
whether one believes that systemic
 
04:51:58.390 --> 04:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
racism exists or not uh the problem I
 
04:52:00.150 --> 04:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
think with this bill is that it really
 
04:52:02.750 --> 04:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
picks aside right and then leverages the
 
04:52:05.750 --> 04:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
government's Financial Resources to
 
04:52:07.708 --> 04:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
suppress this type of private speech
 
04:52:09.910 --> 04:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
about race and gender among State
 
04:52:13.150 --> 04:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
contractors and their employes um for
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
those who dislike um this type of speech
 
04:52:19.948 --> 04:52:19.958 align:start position:0%
on kind of quote divisive topics uh and
 
04:52:21.270 --> 04:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
I know there are many I believe that the
 
04:52:23.030 --> 04:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
solution to this really is to not
 
04:52:25.070 --> 04:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
suppress it among these private actors
 
04:52:27.470 --> 04:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
but to counter it through counter speech
 
04:52:29.830 --> 04:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
um I think it's also worth noting this
 
04:52:32.470 --> 04:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
was highlighted in earlier testimony um
 
04:52:34.788 --> 04:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
this afternoon that a preliminary
 
04:52:36.990 --> 04:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
Nationwide injunction was imposed on
 
04:52:41.750 --> 04:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
portions of a prior executive order um
 
04:52:44.750 --> 04:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's akin to this legislation and I
 
04:52:47.110 --> 04:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
attached that decision uh to my email to
 
04:52:49.590 --> 04:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
the committee uh and what the court
 
04:52:53.270 --> 04:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
concluded in that case is that the
 
04:52:56.390 --> 04:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
executive orders Provisions uh similar
 
04:52:58.310 --> 04:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
Provisions here um concerning
 
04:53:00.190 --> 04:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
contractors likely violated the First
 
04:53:02.190 --> 04:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment quote the government's
 
04:53:04.628 --> 04:53:04.638 align:start position:0%
interest is outweighed by the effect of
 
04:53:06.548 --> 04:53:06.558 align:start position:0%
the impermissible reach of the executive
 
04:53:09.548 --> 04:53:09.558 align:start position:0%
order on plaintiff's freedom to deliver
 
04:53:12.030 --> 04:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
the diversity training and advocacy that
 
04:53:14.230 --> 04:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
they deem necessary to train their own
 
04:53:16.590 --> 04:53:16.600 align:start position:0%
employees and the service providers in
 
04:53:18.230 --> 04:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
the communities in which they work using
 
04:53:20.868 --> 04:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
funds unrelated to the federal contract
 
04:53:23.110 --> 04:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
and I think this this bill really does
 
04:53:25.830 --> 04:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
have in my view that same problem so for
 
04:53:27.750 --> 04:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
those two reasons we oppose this bill
 
04:53:29.868 --> 04:53:29.878 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank the committee for
 
04:53:29.878 --> 04:53:31.310 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank the committee for
its

04:53:31.310 --> 04:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
its
 
04:53:33.390 --> 04:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
time representative Pearson you have a
 
04:53:35.190 --> 04:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
question question I
 
04:53:38.270 --> 04:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
do uh Ju Just for CLA you said you were
 
04:53:40.030 --> 04:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
an attorney for the
 
04:53:43.070 --> 04:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
ACLU yes I work uh I'm I'm the legal
 
04:53:45.350 --> 04:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
director for the ACLU of New Hampshire I
 
04:53:47.830 --> 04:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
actually uh work one block away from the
 
04:53:49.670 --> 04:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
state house right behind CVS on Main
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
Street okay great thank you for the
 
04:53:54.350 --> 04:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
clarification in your tenure as a as an
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
attorney for the ACLU have you have you
 
04:53:58.470 --> 04:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
ever filed or is the ACL of New
 
04:54:01.628 --> 04:54:01.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ever filed a lawsuit using the
 
04:54:04.750 --> 04:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
term hate speech in any way shape
 
04:54:07.510 --> 04:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
form no I don't gosh I don't think so I
 
04:54:10.350 --> 04:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
mean hate speech is not a really a legal
 
04:54:14.430 --> 04:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
term right uh it's not necessarily you
 
04:54:16.788 --> 04:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
know one of the categories even of
 
04:54:18.628 --> 04:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
unprotected speech so I don't think at
 
04:54:19.990 --> 04:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
least in my
 
04:54:22.350 --> 04:54:22.360 align:start position:0%
practice uh it's something that it's
 
04:54:24.990 --> 04:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
really a term that I have used in my
 
04:54:26.948 --> 04:54:26.958 align:start position:0%
work in
 
04:54:28.830 --> 04:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
court thank
 
04:54:32.150 --> 04:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
you representative Roy thank you for
 
04:54:34.110 --> 04:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
taking that question um
 
04:54:36.910 --> 04:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
okay so first my question is you
 
04:54:39.910 --> 04:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
discussed how this would impact private
 
04:54:39.920 --> 04:54:41.670 align:start position:0%
discussed how this would impact private
company

04:54:41.670 --> 04:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
company
 
04:54:44.990 --> 04:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
contract didn't touch ones ACL have a
 
04:54:48.430 --> 04:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
position on
 
04:54:53.390 --> 04:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
question sorry we microphone challenged
 
04:54:56.000 --> 04:54:57.548 align:start position:0%
question sorry we microphone challenged
here

04:54:57.548 --> 04:54:57.558 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:55:01.390 --> 04:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
um my question was he uh said the
 
04:55:04.350 --> 04:55:04.360 align:start position:0%
opinion of the ACLU regarding um private
 
04:55:06.030 --> 04:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
contractors a work for the state but I'm
 
04:55:08.110 --> 04:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
interested in the aclu's position on
 
04:55:11.470 --> 04:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
Schools whereby students um are mandated
 
04:55:14.390 --> 04:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
by law to attend and therefore they
 
04:55:16.708 --> 04:55:16.718 align:start position:0%
don't have a choice or the ability to
 
04:55:18.750 --> 04:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
counter this speech what is the position
 
04:55:20.270 --> 04:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
of the AC on
 
04:55:23.470 --> 04:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
that yeah I uh I haven't thought about
 
04:55:26.350 --> 04:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
that issue I'm not sure how pervasive
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
this type of uh teaching is in New
 
04:55:32.230 --> 04:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we uh I don't think have
 
04:55:34.910 --> 04:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
taken a position on whether or not uh
 
04:55:36.868 --> 04:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
this type of instruction should be
 
04:55:38.590 --> 04:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
mandated in schools I can tell you that
 
04:55:40.310 --> 04:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
where we have been more active when
 
04:55:43.310 --> 04:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
where I have been more active uh is to
 
04:55:46.070 --> 04:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
what extent uh implicit bias training
 
04:55:47.628 --> 04:55:47.638 align:start position:0%
should be involved in law enforcement
 
04:55:49.390 --> 04:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
training right that was one of the
 
04:55:51.910 --> 04:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
issues that was squarely presented
 
04:55:53.910 --> 04:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
before uh before Lea and that's
 
04:55:55.788 --> 04:55:55.798 align:start position:0%
something that that we've advocated uh
 
04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
for we think that uh is important but
 
04:55:59.670 --> 04:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
that really again is ultimately the
 
04:56:02.788 --> 04:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
choice of the employer in this case law
 
04:56:05.110 --> 04:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement to decide whether that's
 
04:56:07.590 --> 04:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate for their officers and
 
04:56:10.110 --> 04:56:10.120 align:start position:0%
something that um they should be using
 
04:56:13.430 --> 04:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
to Foster trust uh with the community so
 
04:56:15.190 --> 04:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
I didn't mean to Pivot I I don't really
 
04:56:17.868 --> 04:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
have a direct answer to your question uh
 
04:56:20.270 --> 04:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative Roy I I don't think it's
 
04:56:21.708 --> 04:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
something that at least I've taken a
 
04:56:25.750 --> 04:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:28.910 --> 04:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
context um and just a quick followup um
 
04:56:30.990 --> 04:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
sure you're the second or third witness
 
04:56:33.548 --> 04:56:33.558 align:start position:0%
who's mentioned the uh the court case
 
04:56:36.070 --> 04:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
against the Trump executive order uh
 
04:56:37.830 --> 04:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
just to be clear that that was a a
 
04:56:41.430 --> 04:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
district court case that issued that um
 
04:56:43.830 --> 04:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
that issued that correct it wasn't
 
04:56:47.190 --> 04:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
um Court no you're absolutely correct uh
 
04:56:49.628 --> 04:56:49.638 align:start position:0%
representative Roy I believe it was the
 
04:56:51.270 --> 04:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
it was the federal judge in the district
 
04:56:53.070 --> 04:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
of California so you're but you're
 
04:56:54.590 --> 04:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
exactly right no it wasn't an appell at
 
04:56:56.830 --> 04:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
circuit court or the US Supreme Court
 
04:57:01.270 --> 04:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:03.708 --> 04:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
you I call Cheryl
 
04:57:09.390 --> 04:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:12.948 --> 04:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
yourself let's see okay there you are
 
04:57:16.150 --> 04:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes
 
04:57:19.350 --> 04:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
okay um I'm here today speaking as a
 
04:57:21.548 --> 04:57:21.558 align:start position:0%
private citizen uh
 
04:57:23.990 --> 04:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
although I served on the New Hampshire
 
04:57:27.750 --> 04:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
commission for human rights for 13 years
 
04:57:29.310 --> 04:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
and I've also been an
 
04:57:32.750 --> 04:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
educator uh at um a university here in
 
04:57:35.310 --> 04:57:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:38.110 --> 04:57:38.120 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me a lot of what I
 
04:57:41.150 --> 04:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to say is has already been said
 
04:57:43.310 --> 04:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
um I I
 
04:57:47.150 --> 04:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
oppose uh House Bill
 
04:57:47.160 --> 04:57:49.750 align:start position:0%
oppose uh House Bill
544

04:57:49.750 --> 04:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
544
 
04:57:53.390 --> 04:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
um it would
 
04:57:57.470 --> 04:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
um it seems make the department of
 
04:58:00.948 --> 04:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
administrative Services the Arbiter of
 
04:58:04.310 --> 04:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
of teaching plans and determining what
 
04:58:08.990 --> 04:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
kind of speech is acceptable about
 
04:58:12.230 --> 04:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
discrimination um there's a couple key
 
04:58:18.910 --> 04:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
parts of the proposed bill um that I I
 
04:58:20.548 --> 04:58:20.558 align:start position:0%
think are overly
 
04:58:25.270 --> 04:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
Broad and um many of the the topics that
 
04:58:27.190 --> 04:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
we're talking about teaching of history
 
04:58:30.230 --> 04:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
and training about civil rights are
 
04:58:32.110 --> 04:58:32.120 align:start position:0%
going to be by their very nature
 
04:58:34.030 --> 04:58:34.040 align:start position:0%
controversial there are going to be
 
04:58:37.470 --> 04:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
differences of opinion and we we don't
 
04:58:41.430 --> 04:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
want to have you know a a specific
 
04:58:45.548 --> 04:58:45.558 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic agency trying to pre-screen
 
04:58:49.430 --> 04:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
all of the teaching plans and and
 
04:58:52.310 --> 04:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
um determine what's going to be
 
04:58:54.470 --> 04:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
acceptable within the
 
04:58:58.270 --> 04:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
classrooms uh at the University level
 
04:59:02.030 --> 04:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
um or at the the secondary
 
04:59:06.590 --> 04:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
level I hope that you'll um oppose this
 
04:59:09.948 --> 04:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
bill I don't think that the bill is is
 
04:59:14.190 --> 04:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
necessary or likely to to
 
04:59:18.150 --> 04:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
promote um human rights in New
 
04:59:21.510 --> 04:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we've had a
 
04:59:25.390 --> 04:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination bill here for over
 
04:59:25.400 --> 04:59:26.990 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination bill here for over
50

04:59:26.990 --> 04:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
50
 
04:59:30.350 --> 04:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
years the commission for Human Rights
 
04:59:34.470 --> 04:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
was created as a civil rights agenc
 
04:59:37.070 --> 04:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
um by the legislature it was a a
 
04:59:41.470 --> 04:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
bipartisan effort and um
 
04:59:46.270 --> 04:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
that agency plays a key role in in
 
04:59:48.750 --> 04:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
working toward ending discrimination it
 
04:59:51.430 --> 04:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
also has as part of its Mission the
 
04:59:56.350 --> 04:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
educational Outreach and um I think that
 
04:59:59.110 --> 04:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
this is problematic in terms of freedom
 
05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
of speech rights both at the state level
 
05:00:05.030 --> 05:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
and at the national level so I'll I'll
 
05:00:08.750 --> 05:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
end there and urge you to um vote
 
05:00:11.190 --> 05:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
against this
 
05:00:14.350 --> 05:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative Pearson
 
05:00:17.030 --> 05:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
you have a question I do you said you
 
05:00:18.990 --> 05:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
you were taught at the University
 
05:00:22.390 --> 05:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
level yes I did thank you ma'am uh you
 
05:00:23.510 --> 05:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
wear on page
 
05:00:26.230 --> 05:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
four at line 21 says nothing in this
 
05:00:28.830 --> 05:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
chapter chapter shall be construed to
 
05:00:31.430 --> 05:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
prohibit discussing as part of a larger
 
05:00:33.510 --> 05:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
course of academic instruction the
 
05:00:37.270 --> 05:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
divisive Concepts listed in RSA 10 C1
 
05:00:39.350 --> 05:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
section 2 in an objective Manner and
 
05:00:42.948 --> 05:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
without endorsement so the idea did I
 
05:00:44.510 --> 05:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
hear you correctly that that you're
 
05:00:47.150 --> 05:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
arguing that that this bill prevents
 
05:00:49.110 --> 05:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
universities from having the discussion
 
05:00:50.390 --> 05:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
because what I'm reading on page four
 
05:00:50.400 --> 05:00:51.750 align:start position:0%
because what I'm reading on page four
ISS

05:00:51.750 --> 05:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
ISS
 
05:00:55.150 --> 05:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise no I think your other um
 
05:00:57.948 --> 05:00:57.958 align:start position:0%
speakers today have argued that it will
 
05:01:00.830 --> 05:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
have a chilling effect on speech as a
 
05:01:02.868 --> 05:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
matter of fact I've I've heard from
 
05:01:05.470 --> 05:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
faculty members who just are already
 
05:01:07.868 --> 05:01:07.878 align:start position:0%
concerned about this bill and whether
 
05:01:09.868 --> 05:01:09.878 align:start position:0%
it's going to be passed and how it might
 
05:01:11.788 --> 05:01:11.798 align:start position:0%
impact how they're teaching in the
 
05:01:16.150 --> 05:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
classroom um and that does lead to to
 
05:01:19.788 --> 05:01:19.798 align:start position:0%
people self-censoring and I think would
 
05:01:21.590 --> 05:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
be likely to to have that kind of
 
05:01:21.600 --> 05:01:24.628 align:start position:0%
be likely to to have that kind of
chilling

05:01:24.628 --> 05:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:29.070 --> 05:01:29.080 align:start position:0%
effect thank you Miss Shirley other
 
05:01:31.868 --> 05:01:31.878 align:start position:0%
questions okay my list of people who
 
05:01:34.150 --> 05:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak doesn't seem to relate
 
05:01:36.910 --> 05:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
very well to the attendees list so if
 
05:01:38.670 --> 05:01:38.680 align:start position:0%

representatives and attendees my name is
 
05:03:10.030 --> 05:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
Christine Carpenter and I'm a resident
 
05:03:12.110 --> 05:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
of Windam New Hampshire I have a
 
05:03:13.310 --> 05:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
master's degree from the University of
 
05:03:14.670 --> 05:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
Cambridge and I'm a few months away from
 
05:03:16.190 --> 05:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
earning a law degree from the University
 
05:03:18.310 --> 05:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
of Pennsylvania Law School and I'm a
 
05:03:19.830 --> 05:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
product of the New Hampshire Public
 
05:03:22.190 --> 05:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
School System having spent 12 years in
 
05:03:23.270 --> 05:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
the Windham School District and the
 
05:03:25.788 --> 05:03:25.798 align:start position:0%
better part of a decade in higher ed I
 
05:03:27.868 --> 05:03:27.878 align:start position:0%
have a fair deal of experience in the
 
05:03:30.150 --> 05:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
process of being taught this is the lens
 
05:03:31.868 --> 05:03:31.878 align:start position:0%
through which I came to offer my view of
 
05:03:33.670 --> 05:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
this bill today
 
05:03:35.190 --> 05:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation causes me a
 
05:03:37.548 --> 05:03:37.558 align:start position:0%
great deal of concern because it
 
05:03:39.430 --> 05:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
essentially hamstrings teachers access
 
05:03:42.190 --> 05:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
to the resources necessary to better
 
05:03:43.830 --> 05:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
understand the individuals sitting in
 
05:03:45.350 --> 05:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
their classrooms and therefore their
 
05:03:46.990 --> 05:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
ability to effectively teach their
 
05:03:49.270 --> 05:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
students my central issue with the bill
 
05:03:51.110 --> 05:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
is this as one of or actually I think
 
05:03:53.590 --> 05:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
several of the earlier speakers noted
 
05:03:55.548 --> 05:03:55.558 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't only address teachings
 
05:03:57.510 --> 05:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
rooted in critical race Theory although
 
05:03:59.590 --> 05:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
that may have been its original
 
05:04:01.830 --> 05:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
intention and we can sit here today and
 
05:04:03.110 --> 05:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
discuss the merage
 
05:04:06.190 --> 05:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
and the flaws with critical race Theory
 
05:04:08.470 --> 05:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
truly endlessly clearly just judging by
 
05:04:10.948 --> 05:04:10.958 align:start position:0%
the number of testifying that we've had
 
05:04:13.510 --> 05:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to talk about there but
 
05:04:16.990 --> 05:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
all of that aside what this bill does is
 
05:04:19.190 --> 05:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
it essentially limits an overly broad
 
05:04:21.708 --> 05:04:21.718 align:start position:0%
category of topics of conversation in
 
05:04:23.628 --> 05:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
teacher trainings in teacher contracts
 
05:04:26.708 --> 05:04:26.718 align:start position:0%
in Grant applications Etc so in non
 
05:04:28.590 --> 05:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional law terms that just means
 
05:04:30.548 --> 05:04:30.558 align:start position:0%
it hampers more topics than it
 
05:04:33.788 --> 05:04:33.798 align:start position:0%
explicitly aims to so if you want to
 
05:04:35.310 --> 05:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
write a bill prohibiting the teaching of
 
05:04:36.788 --> 05:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
critical race theory in schools and the
 
05:04:38.390 --> 05:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
training of teachers around critical
 
05:04:40.310 --> 05:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
race Theory then by all means draft one
 
05:04:42.788 --> 05:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
and let's have a conversation about that
 
05:04:44.868 --> 05:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
on the Merit specifically but that is
 
05:04:46.590 --> 05:04:46.600 align:start position:0%
not what this bill achieves in its
 
05:04:49.190 --> 05:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
current form so to illustrate this by
 
05:04:51.270 --> 05:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
way of example in the medical field
 
05:04:53.430 --> 05:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
doctors are more likely to misdiagnose
 
05:04:55.350 --> 05:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
an illness in someone who is Black than
 
05:04:57.350 --> 05:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
someone who is white to varying degrees
 
05:04:59.590 --> 05:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
based on the illness in a car crash
 
05:05:01.948 --> 05:05:01.958 align:start position:0%
women are 73% more likely to be killed
 
05:05:03.548 --> 05:05:03.558 align:start position:0%
or seriously injured because data
 
05:05:05.470 --> 05:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
gathered from Crash simulations and the
 
05:05:07.390 --> 05:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
Crash Test Dummies themselves are
 
05:05:09.868 --> 05:05:09.878 align:start position:0%
statistically modeled based on men
 
05:05:11.470 --> 05:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
collectively individuals that identify
 
05:05:13.190 --> 05:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
as something other than heterosexual are
 
05:05:14.788 --> 05:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
more likely to experience physical
 
05:05:16.548 --> 05:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
violence and verbal abuse as a result of
 
05:05:18.628 --> 05:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
their sexuality and children in this
 
05:05:20.470 --> 05:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
population are twice as likely to
 
05:05:22.190 --> 05:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
attempt or to commit suicide before they
 
05:05:25.750 --> 05:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
turn 18 than their heterosexual peers in
 
05:05:27.868 --> 05:05:27.878 align:start position:0%
the context of covid-19 which is why I
 
05:05:29.670 --> 05:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
can speak to you today from my desk in
 
05:05:31.750 --> 05:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania black Americans account for
 
05:05:35.150 --> 05:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
13% of the US population and yet 24% of
 
05:05:37.948 --> 05:05:37.958 align:start position:0%
coronavirus deaths these statistics have
 
05:05:40.430 --> 05:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
something important in common under the
 
05:05:43.510 --> 05:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
definition section 2 C and four of Bill
 
05:05:45.868 --> 05:05:45.878 align:start position:0%
544 all of these statistics and the
 
05:05:47.470 --> 05:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
issues that they represent could be
 
05:05:50.030 --> 05:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
prohibited for Teacher trainings now
 
05:05:51.910 --> 05:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
could is doing a lot of work here I
 
05:05:52.868 --> 05:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
understand that that might not have been
 
05:05:54.350 --> 05:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
the intention of the drafters nor the
 
05:05:55.750 --> 05:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
intention of anyone who has come out to
 
05:05:58.190 --> 05:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of this bill today but
 
05:06:00.030 --> 05:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
that is what the bill can be weaponized
 
05:06:02.830 --> 05:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
to achieve this bill can be used as a
 
05:06:05.270 --> 05:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
tool to resist teacher trainings deny
 
05:06:07.030 --> 05:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
Grant applications and curtail teacher
 
05:06:08.470 --> 05:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
contracts based on Extreme political
 
05:06:11.190 --> 05:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
views that are themselves divisive this
 
05:06:13.830 --> 05:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
would also be done so out of a misnaming
 
05:06:15.830 --> 05:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
and a misidentifying of the aim that the
 
05:06:18.910 --> 05:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
bill purports to achieve I'm referring
 
05:06:20.708 --> 05:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
specifically to the Bill's insistent
 
05:06:22.310 --> 05:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
limiting of discussions and trainings
 
05:06:25.390 --> 05:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
around unconscious biases so for example
 
05:06:27.110 --> 05:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
the doctor that misdiagnoses a patient
 
05:06:28.788 --> 05:06:28.798 align:start position:0%
because medical textbooks fail to note
 
05:06:30.350 --> 05:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
differing signs and symptoms in a
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
disease for people of color is not
 
05:06:34.990 --> 05:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
consciously racist nor is the scientist
 
05:06:36.910 --> 05:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
that designed the craft test simulations
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
consciously sexist but the reality and
 
05:06:41.110 --> 05:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
the actual implications of their work
 
05:06:42.990 --> 05:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
nevertheless has racist and sexist
 
05:06:45.708 --> 05:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
outcomes these outcomes matter because
 
05:06:48.470 --> 05:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
people die as a result and crucially to
 
05:06:50.590 --> 05:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
my point people die in systemically
 
05:06:54.430 --> 05:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
unequal ratios people of color die more
 
05:06:56.670 --> 05:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
of the time from misdiagnosis sorry
 
05:06:59.270 --> 05:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
misdiagnosis than white people women die
 
05:07:01.670 --> 05:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
more of the time in the same kind of car
 
05:07:04.150 --> 05:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
accent than
 
05:07:06.830 --> 05:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
men so under your definition of divisive
 
05:07:08.548 --> 05:07:08.558 align:start position:0%
these objective realities would be
 
05:07:10.510 --> 05:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
prohibited topics of conversation in the
 
05:07:11.868 --> 05:07:11.878 align:start position:0%
realm of public education training in
 
05:07:13.948 --> 05:07:13.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire moreover this bill if it
 
05:07:15.628 --> 05:07:15.638 align:start position:0%
existed as company policy at an
 
05:07:17.708 --> 05:07:17.718 align:start position:0%
automobile manufacturer or a hospital
 
05:07:19.310 --> 05:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
would prevent those who work in their
 
05:07:21.230 --> 05:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
field from being able to be made aware
 
05:07:23.788 --> 05:07:23.798 align:start position:0%
of this problem so that they can repair
 
05:07:28.350 --> 05:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
it the sorry I said Thank you you've
 
05:07:30.390 --> 05:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
you've exceeded what we consider our
 
05:07:33.030 --> 05:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
normal limit could you will just wrap it
 
05:07:35.110 --> 05:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
up quickly I would appreciate it
 
05:07:38.150 --> 05:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely apologies chair so the bottom
 
05:07:39.670 --> 05:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
line here today is I'm not here to talk
 
05:07:41.390 --> 05:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
about the Constitutional implications of
 
05:07:42.830 --> 05:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
this bill although I do as other
 
05:07:45.030 --> 05:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
speakers have said want to note that
 
05:07:47.430 --> 05:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
there are many I'm here as a citizen of
 
05:07:49.430 --> 05:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that is concerned about
 
05:07:51.070 --> 05:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
students ability to learn from a
 
05:07:51.080 --> 05:07:52.868 align:start position:0%
students ability to learn from a
productive

05:07:52.868 --> 05:07:52.878 align:start position:0%
productive
 
05:07:55.590 --> 05:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
dialogue and in light of that I think it
 
05:07:57.628 --> 05:07:57.638 align:start position:0%
is fervently important that this bill be
 
05:07:59.470 --> 05:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
opposed and I am happy to have future
 
05:08:02.310 --> 05:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
comment or discussion uh if you I think
 
05:08:03.910 --> 05:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
have my email from the login if anyone
 
05:08:05.750 --> 05:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
would like it I really really think it's
 
05:08:06.948 --> 05:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
important to continue communicating
 
05:08:08.670 --> 05:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
about these issues but in its current
 
05:08:10.310 --> 05:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
form this bill does not achieve
 
05:08:11.470 --> 05:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
something that is beneficial for New
 
05:08:13.590 --> 05:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Ed Educators it's students or
 
05:08:15.590 --> 05:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
frankly it's alumni that need to go out
 
05:08:17.470 --> 05:08:17.480 align:start position:0%
and operate in a world in which these
 
05:08:19.510 --> 05:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
issues are real and these issues have
 
05:08:21.230 --> 05:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
implications that matter that we have to
 
05:08:22.948 --> 05:08:22.958 align:start position:0%
engage with whether our public school
 
05:08:24.310 --> 05:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire will teach us
 
05:08:26.788 --> 05:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
about them or not thank you very much
 
05:08:29.150 --> 05:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
will you answer a question
 
05:08:31.948 --> 05:08:31.958 align:start position:0%
happily laus uh thank you madam chair
 
05:08:34.750 --> 05:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question um I
 
05:08:37.948 --> 05:08:37.958 align:start position:0%
mean you're you're con can you help me
 
05:08:39.470 --> 05:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
understand what part of the bill do you
 
05:08:41.628 --> 05:08:41.638 align:start position:0%
think would prevent discussions of
 
05:08:42.948 --> 05:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
things like the facts that there's
 
05:08:45.670 --> 05:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
problems with you know the the things
 
05:08:47.548 --> 05:08:47.558 align:start position:0%
that are parameters for Designing car
 
05:08:50.110 --> 05:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
tests or or some of the other things you
 
05:08:52.350 --> 05:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned which seem to be just you know
 
05:08:55.830 --> 05:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
facts about accidents and and and the
 
05:08:57.750 --> 05:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
reasons why um there may be
 
05:08:59.750 --> 05:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
disproportionate effects I'm not seeing
 
05:09:01.310 --> 05:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
anything in the bill that would do that
 
05:09:03.350 --> 05:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
what what do you think actually result
 
05:09:05.548 --> 05:09:05.558 align:start position:0%
in that sure so specifically if you look
 
05:09:08.628 --> 05:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
at the definition sections 2 C and four
 
05:09:10.190 --> 05:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
um I can talk about other sections of
 
05:09:11.310 --> 05:09:11.320 align:start position:0%
the definition as well but just to give
 
05:09:14.070 --> 05:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
you by way of example what the bill gets
 
05:09:15.788 --> 05:09:15.798 align:start position:0%
at is issues surrounding unconscious
 
05:09:17.270 --> 05:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
biases and suggesting that they're
 
05:09:19.708 --> 05:09:19.718 align:start position:0%
inherent to the way that groups of
 
05:09:21.350 --> 05:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
people live their lives simply by nature
 
05:09:23.830 --> 05:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the certain population or demographic
 
05:09:25.830 --> 05:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
that they fall into um so if we're
 
05:09:27.910 --> 05:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
disagreeing on how that language can be
 
05:09:29.948 --> 05:09:29.958 align:start position:0%
read then the rest of what I'm about to
 
05:09:31.948 --> 05:09:31.958 align:start position:0%
say isn't really going to resonate but
 
05:09:34.190 --> 05:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
um how that language is written and how
 
05:09:36.948 --> 05:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
I read it and how I'm concerned someone
 
05:09:38.948 --> 05:09:38.958 align:start position:0%
who might want to use this bill for
 
05:09:41.548 --> 05:09:41.558 align:start position:0%
counterproductive or for harmful ends
 
05:09:46.070 --> 05:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
could use that language um it does limit
 
05:09:48.230 --> 05:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
topics of unconscious bias again and I'm
 
05:09:49.628 --> 05:09:49.638 align:start position:0%
not talking about in the classroom I
 
05:09:50.430 --> 05:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
understand that that's not where this
 
05:09:52.628 --> 05:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
bill is aimed but it does limit those
 
05:09:54.590 --> 05:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
topics coming up in example in spaces
 
05:09:56.270 --> 05:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
like teacher trainings and I know as
 
05:09:57.670 --> 05:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
people have said repeatedly this bill
 
05:09:58.910 --> 05:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't limit diversity and inclusion
 
05:10:00.390 --> 05:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
trainings and maybe it wasn't meant to
 
05:10:02.190 --> 05:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
but this language could be used to
 
05:10:04.788 --> 05:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
accomplish that um and the concern there
 
05:10:06.670 --> 05:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
is that there are two steps here right
 
05:10:08.708 --> 05:10:08.718 align:start position:0%
there's teachers teaching students and
 
05:10:09.750 --> 05:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
the conversations that's happening in
 
05:10:10.868 --> 05:10:10.878 align:start position:0%
the classroom but then there's what's
 
05:10:12.510 --> 05:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
happening before teachers get in the
 
05:10:14.990 --> 05:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
classroom and how equipped they are to
 
05:10:16.470 --> 05:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
understand the nuances of different
 
05:10:18.110 --> 05:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
lived experiences as many of the testif
 
05:10:19.990 --> 05:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
finds have talked about today um and how
 
05:10:21.390 --> 05:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
to engage with those constructively in a
 
05:10:23.830 --> 05:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
classroom so that we are having a
 
05:10:26.390 --> 05:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
productive and nuanced dialogue and not
 
05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
just you know hurdling insults across
 
05:10:29.830 --> 05:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
the aisle and unless teachers are
 
05:10:32.190 --> 05:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
trained on how to really tease out the
 
05:10:33.670 --> 05:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
the fundamental differences in those
 
05:10:35.230 --> 05:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
conversations in a way that's productive
 
05:10:37.830 --> 05:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
and also not harmful or not biased and
 
05:10:40.470 --> 05:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
not uh in any way pervasively negative
 
05:10:42.230 --> 05:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
to certain populations of its
 
05:10:44.110 --> 05:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
students those conversations aren't
 
05:10:45.310 --> 05:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
going to happen in a way that's actually
 
05:10:46.868 --> 05:10:46.878 align:start position:0%
helpful so they're going to happen and
 
05:10:47.590 --> 05:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to happen for these
 
05:10:48.708 --> 05:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
students for the rest of their lives
 
05:10:50.150 --> 05:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
just by nature of growing up in today's
 
05:10:51.868 --> 05:10:51.878 align:start position:0%
America but if we want the students to
 
05:10:53.628 --> 05:10:53.638 align:start position:0%
be able to do that well we need teachers
 
05:10:54.990 --> 05:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that well and teachers
 
05:10:56.430 --> 05:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
can't be taught how to do that well if
 
05:10:58.430 --> 05:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
they can't be informed that we are human
 
05:11:00.190 --> 05:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
and therefore we have biases we see the
 
05:11:02.430 --> 05:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
World by nature of our experience and
 
05:11:03.670 --> 05:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
those experiences are different and they
 
05:11:05.270 --> 05:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
need to be able to be talked about and
 
05:11:07.110 --> 05:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
teased out again in hopefully
 
05:11:08.788 --> 05:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
professional productive settings uh so
 
05:11:10.510 --> 05:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
that they can better teach students
 
05:11:13.350 --> 05:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
05:11:17.548 --> 05:11:17.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:19.990 --> 05:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
question uh yeah I was just gonna ask I
 
05:11:21.948 --> 05:11:21.958 align:start position:0%
was wondering if it was possible that
 
05:11:24.350 --> 05:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
the reason why uh women are more likely
 
05:11:26.910 --> 05:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
to die in fire accidents is because they
 
05:11:28.708 --> 05:11:28.718 align:start position:0%
actually have physically weaker bodies
 
05:11:31.390 --> 05:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily a bias on the
 
05:11:34.708 --> 05:11:34.718 align:start position:0%
engineers design the car I think that's
 
05:11:36.990 --> 05:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
aant to this bill I'm afraid so I'm
 
05:11:39.390 --> 05:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
going to squel the question we could
 
05:11:41.390 --> 05:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
speculate on that for hours and I'd be
 
05:11:43.150 --> 05:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
glad to some other time I was gonna say
 
05:11:44.830 --> 05:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
if you want to email me we can have that
 
05:11:46.030 --> 05:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
discussion there are answers to your
 
05:11:47.270 --> 05:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
question but yeah I don't know that it
 
05:11:50.190 --> 05:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
pertains directly to the language of the
 
05:11:53.390 --> 05:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:57.230 --> 05:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
you okay uh L Spen excuse me that
 
05:11:59.190 --> 05:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
representative Shu has a question you
 
05:12:02.150 --> 05:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
too you do too okay thank you Madam
 
05:12:04.310 --> 05:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
chair um I don't actually have a
 
05:12:07.150 --> 05:12:07.160 align:start position:0%
question for this person but I just
 
05:12:09.590 --> 05:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to call to the chair's attention
 
05:12:13.070 --> 05:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
that Mr padmore from the medical society
 
05:12:16.150 --> 05:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
I believe had signed to speak and has
 
05:12:18.948 --> 05:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
not been called has to leave the meeting
 
05:12:21.910 --> 05:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
at 3:30 I was wondering if you might be
 
05:12:21.920 --> 05:12:24.628 align:start position:0%
at 3:30 I was wondering if you might be
able

05:12:24.628 --> 05:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:27.910 --> 05:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
TOs and Pon you had a question I do um
 
05:12:28.830 --> 05:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
you you
 
05:12:31.030 --> 05:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
just she's not on the screen but ma'am
 
05:12:33.270 --> 05:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
you just said something
 
05:12:35.708 --> 05:12:35.718 align:start position:0%
brilliant you said we see the World by
 
05:12:38.390 --> 05:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
the nature of our experiences and I
 
05:12:43.190 --> 05:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
would completely agree with you but the
 
05:12:43.200 --> 05:12:44.070 align:start position:0%
would completely agree with you but the
problem

05:12:44.070 --> 05:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:12:46.628 --> 05:12:46.638 align:start position:0%
with that's going on here that's being
 
05:12:48.788 --> 05:12:48.798 align:start position:0%
addressed is that that is not what this
 
05:12:51.390 --> 05:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
bill is covering does this bill not say
 
05:12:53.350 --> 05:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
that you see the world based on your
 
05:12:57.030 --> 05:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
gender or your sex how you were born and
 
05:13:00.390 --> 05:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:02.628 --> 05:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
experience I'm sorry sir I don't know
 
05:13:03.948 --> 05:13:03.958 align:start position:0%
that I understand exactly what you're
 
05:13:05.350 --> 05:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
trying to get at with your question I
 
05:13:06.910 --> 05:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
would say that those two are
 
05:13:10.270 --> 05:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
interrelated um so I'm not I'm not I
 
05:13:12.548 --> 05:13:12.558 align:start position:0%
think that might be those things are
 
05:13:14.030 --> 05:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
mutually inclusive so I'm not really
 
05:13:15.230 --> 05:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
sure how you're trying to distinguish
 
05:13:17.708 --> 05:13:17.718 align:start position:0%
them thank
 
05:13:19.750 --> 05:13:19.760 align:start position:0%

Academy of family physicians strongly

oppose HB 544 um from a public health
 
05:13:55.830 --> 05:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
standpoint there is clear evidence that
 
05:13:57.310 --> 05:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
inequities and disparities
 
05:13:59.430 --> 05:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affect people of
 
05:14:01.350 --> 05:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
color and women we need to learn about
 
05:14:03.150 --> 05:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
these topics and trainings in order to
 
05:14:04.910 --> 05:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
address them and create true Health

Equity in New Hampshire if we can't talk
 
05:14:08.750 --> 05:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
about the facts we can't solve the
 
05:14:10.910 --> 05:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
problem uh there is extensive there is
 
05:14:12.830 --> 05:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
an extensive body of evidence in medical
 
05:14:14.830 --> 05:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
literature and Broad Acceptance in the
 
05:14:17.310 --> 05:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
medical community that racism and sexism
 
05:14:19.190 --> 05:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
have negatively impacted health and the

well-being of people of color and women
 
05:14:23.590 --> 05:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
throughout history of this country in
 
05:14:24.990 --> 05:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
fact many of the country's medical
 
05:14:27.430 --> 05:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
associations have recognized racism is a
 
05:14:29.910 --> 05:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
Public Health crisis covid has shown us
 
05:14:31.868 --> 05:14:31.878 align:start position:0%
irrefutable differences in health

Equity Response Team initial report and
 
05:14:43.990 --> 05:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh we must be able to
 
05:14:45.510 --> 05:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
understand and address these differences
 
05:14:47.708 --> 05:14:47.718 align:start position:0%
known as health disparities training

providers to understand the impacts of

racism and sexism on the on health is
 
05:14:55.350 --> 05:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
imperative to the ability to care for
 
05:14:57.510 --> 05:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
patients and improve health outcomes
 
05:14:59.390 --> 05:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
additionally as Physicians we cannot be
 
05:15:01.628 --> 05:15:01.638 align:start position:0%
limited in our ability to treat diseases
 
05:15:03.110 --> 05:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
not being able to train doctors on
 
05:15:05.310 --> 05:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
racism and sexism and its effects on
 
05:15:07.510 --> 05:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
health outcomes is tantamount to saying
 
05:15:09.350 --> 05:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
doctors can't learn about treating covid
 
05:15:11.628 --> 05:15:11.638 align:start position:0%
or cancer as physician scientists we
 
05:15:13.910 --> 05:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
must practice evidence-based medicine to
 
05:15:15.830 --> 05:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
best care for our patients rather than
 
05:15:18.150 --> 05:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
serving as divisive Concepts regular

impact the economy as well this is

05:15:55.910 --> 05:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
amount to approximately 93 billion
 
05:15:58.310 --> 05:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
dollar in excess medical care costs and
 
05:16:01.030 --> 05:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
$42 billion in loss productivity per
 
05:16:03.230 --> 05:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
year and describes the violent or excuse
 
05:16:05.390 --> 05:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
me the vital uh connection between
 
05:16:07.910 --> 05:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
Health Equity and value as improvements
 
05:16:09.868 --> 05:16:09.878 align:start position:0%
in Health Equity can provide tremendous
 
05:16:11.830 --> 05:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
value to patients hospitals and the
 
05:16:13.990 --> 05:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
healthc care delivery system while we
 
05:16:15.750 --> 05:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly concur with a statement
 
05:16:18.910 --> 05:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
in h 544 that no one should be judged by
 
05:16:21.910 --> 05:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
their Color Race ethnicity sex or any
 
05:16:23.708 --> 05:16:23.718 align:start position:0%
other characteristic protected by
 
05:16:26.270 --> 05:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
federal or state law it is also crucial
 
05:16:27.910 --> 05:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge that prohibiting these
 
05:16:30.670 --> 05:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
things uh would Rob Physicians of the
 
05:16:32.548 --> 05:16:32.558 align:start position:0%
their ability to inform and treat their
 
05:16:34.590 --> 05:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
patients it is Our obligation to
 
05:16:36.670 --> 05:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
practice medicine with impartiality
 
05:16:38.830 --> 05:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
regardless of our patients gender Andor
 
05:16:41.030 --> 05:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
background in order to do so research
 
05:16:42.750 --> 05:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
has demonstrated that regular training
 
05:16:45.830 --> 05:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
or unconscious bias positively impacts
 
05:16:47.990 --> 05:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
patient uh excuse me physician patient
 
05:16:50.230 --> 05:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
interactions and patient experiences
 
05:16:52.750 --> 05:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
within the health system furthermore if
 
05:16:54.948 --> 05:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
we don't fully understand the social
 
05:16:56.470 --> 05:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
determinance of health and how the
 
05:16:58.590 --> 05:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
structural determinance of racism and
 
05:17:00.948 --> 05:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
sexism impact Health we cannot fully
 
05:17:02.830 --> 05:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
inform our patients in their medical
 
05:17:04.830 --> 05:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
decision-making censorship of our
 
05:17:07.030 --> 05:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
ability to accurately teach assess and
 
05:17:09.230 --> 05:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
treat patients is against our hypocritic
 
05:17:11.230 --> 05:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
oath this applies especially for
 
05:17:13.430 --> 05:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
state-funded health entities including
 
05:17:15.230 --> 05:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Centers
 
05:17:17.470 --> 05:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers and the
 
05:17:19.830 --> 05:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital which serve dis
 
05:17:21.670 --> 05:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me which serve a disproportionate
 
05:17:23.310 --> 05:17:23.320 align:start position:0%
number of people of color and women in
 
05:17:25.310 --> 05:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
our state the medical profession in the
 
05:17:27.430 --> 05:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
granded state acknowledges and supports
 
05:17:29.030 --> 05:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
a patient's right to make their own
 
05:17:30.868 --> 05:17:30.878 align:start position:0%
decisions that are fully informed
 
05:17:32.670 --> 05:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of the physician's personal
 
05:17:34.868 --> 05:17:34.878 align:start position:0%
beliefs we strongly oppose anything that
 
05:17:36.548 --> 05:17:36.558 align:start position:0%
would censor Physicians freedom of
 
05:17:38.750 --> 05:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
speech for patients to make informed
 
05:17:40.788 --> 05:17:40.798 align:start position:0%
decisions we further affirm that the
 
05:17:42.510 --> 05:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
government should not interfere in the
 
05:17:44.948 --> 05:17:44.958 align:start position:0%
doctor patient relationship thus there
 
05:17:46.868 --> 05:17:46.878 align:start position:0%
is no place for government to legislate
 
05:17:49.548 --> 05:17:49.558 align:start position:0%
trainings that impact uh Physicians
 
05:17:51.788 --> 05:17:51.798 align:start position:0%
ability to care for people understanding
 
05:17:54.110 --> 05:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
the impacts of racism and sexism on
 
05:17:56.310 --> 05:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
health is fundamental to our practice of
 
05:17:57.868 --> 05:17:57.878 align:start position:0%
medicine and Public Health in New
 
05:18:00.590 --> 05:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire regular trainings help improve
 
05:18:02.708 --> 05:18:02.718 align:start position:0%
clinical and Public Health outcomes in
 
05:18:05.110 --> 05:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
both the private and public sectors they
 
05:18:07.830 --> 05:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
help promote a free and fair economy and
 
05:18:09.990 --> 05:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
they excuse me and they help Physicians
 
05:18:12.230 --> 05:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
support individuals in making better
 
05:18:14.548 --> 05:18:14.558 align:start position:0%
better informed Health decisions finally
 
05:18:16.628 --> 05:18:16.638 align:start position:0%
they help to ensure that the government
 
05:18:19.230 --> 05:18:19.240 align:start position:0%
and health and Health Care organizations
 
05:18:21.310 --> 05:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
work for everyone because we are all
 
05:18:23.910 --> 05:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
fair and excuse me because we all fair
 
05:18:27.350 --> 05:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
better when we are all well thank you
 
05:18:29.270 --> 05:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
pass I just have one last paragraph
 
05:18:30.708 --> 05:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
passage of this legislation would
 
05:18:33.070 --> 05:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the significant progress we
 
05:18:34.510 --> 05:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
have made in the granted state in
 
05:18:36.390 --> 05:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
considering and understanding Health
 
05:18:37.868 --> 05:18:37.878 align:start position:0%
disparities that are directly
 
05:18:39.750 --> 05:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
attributable to racial and gender
 
05:18:42.070 --> 05:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
inequities it would therefore undermine
 
05:18:43.670 --> 05:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
Public Health initiatives and make it
 
05:18:45.708 --> 05:18:45.718 align:start position:0%
more difficult to improve the health of
 
05:18:47.868 --> 05:18:47.878 align:start position:0%
all citizens in this great state we
 
05:18:49.750 --> 05:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
strongly urge the committee to vote itl
 
05:18:52.948 --> 05:18:52.958 align:start position:0%

fine thank you okay thank you um in your
 
05:19:24.868 --> 05:19:24.878 align:start position:0%
testimony you indicated that the due to
 
05:19:26.910 --> 05:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
racial um
 
05:19:29.350 --> 05:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
disparities that there are greater
 
05:19:31.910 --> 05:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
negative outcomes and deaths
 
05:19:34.830 --> 05:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
that you attributed to to racism and it
 
05:19:38.910 --> 05:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
might be um this bill would would
 
05:19:40.830 --> 05:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
infringe on a doctor's right to discuss
 
05:19:43.788 --> 05:19:43.798 align:start position:0%
that with their patients I believe um
 
05:19:45.430 --> 05:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
one of the leading causes of death in
 
05:19:48.030 --> 05:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
the United States is medical error I was
 
05:19:49.788 --> 05:19:49.798 align:start position:0%
wondering is is that any of that due to
 
05:19:51.790 --> 05:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
racism or is it just other
 
05:19:51.800 --> 05:19:53.670 align:start position:0%
racism or is it just other

Spencer hello Madam chair thank you for
 
05:21:57.310 --> 05:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony today and thank you
 
05:22:01.150 --> 05:22:01.160 align:start position:0%
to all the committee members here um my
 
05:22:02.670 --> 05:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
name is Louise Spencer I'm from
 
05:22:06.030 --> 05:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
conquered New Hampshire I am co-founder
 
05:22:09.030 --> 05:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
of the Kent Street Coalition which is an
 
05:22:11.628 --> 05:22:11.638 align:start position:0%
all volunteer Grassroots advocacy
 
05:22:13.788 --> 05:22:13.798 align:start position:0%
organization but I am here today
 
05:22:17.070 --> 05:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
speaking on my own behalf um and I am
 
05:22:21.670 --> 05:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
here to speak opposed to HB
 
05:22:24.350 --> 05:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
544 um I just want to note I know that
 
05:22:29.670 --> 05:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
attorney Binet talked about the um that
 
05:22:35.150 --> 05:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
Trump the president's EO number 13 was
 
05:22:38.510 --> 05:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
um enjoyed Nationwide in part because of
 
05:22:41.948 --> 05:22:41.958 align:start position:0%
free speech concerns but also the judge
 
05:22:45.030 --> 05:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
found that the EO was so vague that it
 
05:22:46.948 --> 05:22:46.958 align:start position:0%
was impossible for plaintiffs to
 
05:22:49.788 --> 05:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
determine which conduct would be
 
05:22:53.070 --> 05:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
prohibited so this bill if adopted into
 
05:22:56.628 --> 05:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
law would invite lawsuits and therefore
 
05:23:00.230 --> 05:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
is fiscally irresponsible in my opinion
 
05:23:05.110 --> 05:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
um on its merits um I would say that
 
05:23:07.548 --> 05:23:07.558 align:start position:0%
often to understand why we may not
 
05:23:10.350 --> 05:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
perceive something as racist as
 
05:23:14.430 --> 05:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic as sexist Etc it is
 
05:23:17.190 --> 05:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
necessary to deeply examine our own
 
05:23:20.350 --> 05:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
lives and the biases that arise from our
 
05:23:23.350 --> 05:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
lived experience we often need to be
 
05:23:25.990 --> 05:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
challenged to do this because it is
 
05:23:28.788 --> 05:23:28.798 align:start position:0%
inherently difficult and uncomfortable
 
05:23:31.788 --> 05:23:31.798 align:start position:0%
to do the need for this kind of
 
05:23:34.510 --> 05:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
examination can be seen right here in
 
05:23:37.628 --> 05:23:37.638 align:start position:0%
this legislative body the fact that we
 
05:23:40.030 --> 05:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
could have two cting members of the
 
05:23:44.830 --> 05:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
House claim ignorance as a defense after
 
05:23:48.390 --> 05:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
posting overtly anti-semitic and racist
 
05:23:51.230 --> 05:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
memes on their social media accounts
 
05:23:56.110 --> 05:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
shows just please do not talk
 
05:23:59.510 --> 05:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
about do not attack other members or
 
05:24:01.948 --> 05:24:01.958 align:start position:0%
other people please just concentrate on
 
05:24:04.070 --> 05:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
the bill and what your testimony is
 
05:24:06.110 --> 05:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair I would like to challenge
 
05:24:09.190 --> 05:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
that ruling because I feel that any
 
05:24:13.830 --> 05:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
example of racism and sexism per that um
 
05:24:16.190 --> 05:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
perpetuates the very same bias that is
 
05:24:17.868 --> 05:24:17.878 align:start position:0%
being challenged by this bill is
 
05:24:17.878 --> 05:24:19.670 align:start position:0%
being challenged by this bill is
absolutely

05:24:19.670 --> 05:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
05:24:22.310 --> 05:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
germine it's an attack on the specific
 
05:24:25.350 --> 05:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
ref it's not it's no simply stating a
 
05:24:27.830 --> 05:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
fact about what people have tweeted or
 
05:24:30.788 --> 05:24:30.798 align:start position:0%
said publicly in social media is
 
05:24:33.628 --> 05:24:33.638 align:start position:0%
absolutely Germain shut down when they
 
05:24:37.510 --> 05:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
were referencing her tweets thank you
 
05:24:47.990 --> 05:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:50.350 --> 05:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
proceed you need to unmute yourself
 
05:24:53.230 --> 05:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
sorry thank
 
05:24:57.830 --> 05:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
you my point is that too it's too easy
 
05:25:01.310 --> 05:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
to claim ignorance about
 
05:25:04.270 --> 05:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
things that are deeply racist deeply
 
05:25:09.030 --> 05:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic deeply offensive um if we
 
05:25:11.948 --> 05:25:11.958 align:start position:0%
do not do the sorts of training and
 
05:25:14.110 --> 05:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
education that we need to do we should
 
05:25:18.590 --> 05:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
never allow um ignorance to be an
 
05:25:21.788 --> 05:25:21.798 align:start position:0%
excuse and um
 
05:25:25.430 --> 05:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
particularly when certain material can
 
05:25:31.670 --> 05:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
be demonstrably proven to be um hostile
 
05:25:34.628 --> 05:25:34.638 align:start position:0%
toward another person based on their
 
05:25:37.350 --> 05:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
race based on their sex based on their
 
05:25:39.788 --> 05:25:39.798 align:start position:0%
religion so it's
 
05:25:44.590 --> 05:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
imperative that this sort of training be
 
05:25:48.230 --> 05:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
allowed and I think it's something that
 
05:25:51.350 --> 05:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
we need to take a look at here in New
 
05:25:53.910 --> 05:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right in our own
 
05:25:53.920 --> 05:25:55.430 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right in our own
backyard

05:25:55.430 --> 05:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
backyard
 
05:26:00.070 --> 05:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
um and the fact that someone can
 
05:26:02.230 --> 05:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
claiming ignorance but then that can be
 
05:26:05.310 --> 05:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
used as a valid defense is even more
 
05:26:08.150 --> 05:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
troubling so in my opinion there are no
 
05:26:10.230 --> 05:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
amendments that could make this a good
 
05:26:13.350 --> 05:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
bill um because in any form it would
 
05:26:16.628 --> 05:26:16.638 align:start position:0%
chill the free exchange of ideas in
 
05:26:20.548 --> 05:26:20.558 align:start position:0%
violation of the First Amendment and
 
05:26:22.310 --> 05:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
important Civic
 
05:26:26.670 --> 05:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
discourse racism sexism islamophobia
 
05:26:31.310 --> 05:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism ableism homophobia Etc are
 
05:26:33.990 --> 05:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
the actual divisive
 
05:26:37.150 --> 05:26:37.160 align:start position:0%
Concepts unfortunately we can't ban
 
05:26:41.510 --> 05:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
these apparent Concepts but we can
 
05:26:45.030 --> 05:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
educate ourselves and others so that we
 
05:26:48.750 --> 05:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
no longer deny their existence thank you
 
05:26:48.760 --> 05:26:49.510 align:start position:0%
no longer deny their existence thank you
very

Milford we have enough racism as it is
 
05:28:46.430 --> 05:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
right now we don't need another bill
 
05:28:48.350 --> 05:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
that is going to give people the
 
05:28:51.270 --> 05:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
right to raise to treat people
 
05:28:52.708 --> 05:28:52.718 align:start position:0%
differently because the skin color
 
05:28:54.390 --> 05:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
because the language or because what
 
05:28:57.150 --> 05:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
whatever they're from and I believe this
 
05:28:58.590 --> 05:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
country was
 
05:29:01.350 --> 05:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
built by immigrants
 
05:29:03.788 --> 05:29:03.798 align:start position:0%
if you're not a Indian like Native
 
05:29:07.708 --> 05:29:07.718 align:start position:0%
American you're not like real American
 
05:29:10.430 --> 05:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
we have to teach our kids we have so
 
05:29:12.510 --> 05:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
many backgrounds we have so many
 
05:29:15.110 --> 05:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
different cultures that I believe our
 
05:29:18.390 --> 05:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
kids benefit from learning all these
 
05:29:21.070 --> 05:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
different backgrounds and cultures and
 
05:29:23.110 --> 05:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
then we need to teach our kids how to
 
05:29:26.390 --> 05:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
respect women how to respect people no
 
05:29:27.910 --> 05:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
matter where you're from no matter what
 
05:29:30.750 --> 05:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
you look how you look or where you from
 
05:29:33.470 --> 05:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
or what language do you speak I believe
 
05:29:37.750 --> 05:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is like totally needs to like
 
05:29:40.590 --> 05:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
we can't we can't let this bill
 
05:29:44.030 --> 05:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
pass as an immigrant as a personal color
 
05:29:48.548 --> 05:29:48.558 align:start position:0%
I see already discrimination against me
 
05:29:49.708 --> 05:29:49.718 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:29:52.868 --> 05:29:52.878 align:start position:0%
workplace when I go out people think
 
05:29:54.430 --> 05:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
that it's right to tell me that I don't
 
05:29:56.150 --> 05:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
belong to this country because I didn't
 
05:29:59.230 --> 05:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
born in here because I have an accent or
 
05:30:01.390 --> 05:30:01.400 align:start position:0%
because my skin color
 
05:30:04.190 --> 05:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
we have enough discrimination as it is
 
05:30:06.310 --> 05:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
why why do we need another bill to give
 
05:30:08.590 --> 05:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
the people a right to keep discriminate
 
05:30:11.350 --> 05:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
against people different cultures and
 
05:30:13.670 --> 05:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
and and why we don't let the teachers
 
05:30:16.708 --> 05:30:16.718 align:start position:0%
teach the kids that we all different and
 
05:30:20.030 --> 05:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
we all we all have different backgrounds
 
05:30:22.788 --> 05:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
our kids they need to learn that because
 
05:30:24.510 --> 05:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of our kids they go to different
 
05:30:26.948 --> 05:30:26.958 align:start position:0%
countries and they for example they get
 
05:30:29.310 --> 05:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
jobs in like like different continents
 
05:30:30.830 --> 05:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
and they has to learn
 
05:30:32.750 --> 05:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
the culture before they can like be able
 
05:30:35.910 --> 05:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
to do the job correctly so I believe the
 
05:30:37.628 --> 05:30:37.638 align:start position:0%
kids have benefit from learning
 
05:30:39.030 --> 05:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
different cultures when they're in
 
05:30:41.910 --> 05:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
school my kids is like they they they
 
05:30:43.708 --> 05:30:43.718 align:start position:0%
have a different different background
 
05:30:45.548 --> 05:30:45.558 align:start position:0%
they speak two different languages and
 
05:30:47.230 --> 05:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
the benefits they get from learning
 
05:30:49.310 --> 05:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
different cultures and not only they
 
05:30:51.548 --> 05:30:51.558 align:start position:0%
they they know Spanish my daughter know
 
05:30:52.910 --> 05:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
French and they they learn like
 
05:30:55.548 --> 05:30:55.558 align:start position:0%
different cultures from different other
 
05:30:57.868 --> 05:30:57.878 align:start position:0%
uh areas in the world and that's a big
 
05:31:00.270 --> 05:31:00.280 align:start position:0%
benefit when you know a lot of different
 
05:31:02.628 --> 05:31:02.638 align:start position:0%
cultures when you're trying to get a a a
 
05:31:02.638 --> 05:31:05.070 align:start position:0%
cultures when you're trying to get a a a
better

05:31:05.070 --> 05:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:08.430 --> 05:31:08.440 align:start position:0%

05:32:58.390 --> 05:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
for your service uh as an introduction
 
05:33:01.430 --> 05:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
I'm 66 I'm the father of five and I'm
 
05:33:04.150 --> 05:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
the 10th Generation on the oldest family
 
05:33:07.788 --> 05:33:07.798 align:start position:0%
farm in our country uh my ancestors also
 
05:33:09.510 --> 05:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
donated the land to what is now
 
05:33:11.910 --> 05:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire uh
 
05:33:14.190 --> 05:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
professionally I was in the investment
 
05:33:17.910 --> 05:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
business uh for 34 years becoming re
 
05:33:20.788 --> 05:33:20.798 align:start position:0%
before uh retiring and becoming uh
 
05:33:23.990 --> 05:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
irrelevant three years ago um I'm an
 
05:33:26.070 --> 05:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
independent voter and was happy to vote
 
05:33:28.070 --> 05:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
for Warren Redman it's a bit of my
 
05:33:29.150 --> 05:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
background I think it's important to
 
05:33:31.430 --> 05:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
know uh who speaking regarding House
 
05:33:34.548 --> 05:33:34.558 align:start position:0%
Bill 544 I am opposed to this bill in
 
05:33:36.948 --> 05:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
the spirit of brevity I'll just say that
 
05:33:39.310 --> 05:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
the bill is written seems as though it
 
05:33:41.470 --> 05:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
would enable the state of New Hampshire
 
05:33:44.150 --> 05:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
in any way to dictate what classes are
 
05:33:46.030 --> 05:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
offered and what is
 
05:33:49.830 --> 05:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
discussed uh to students and uh being an
 
05:33:52.150 --> 05:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
elder person who would like to uh always
 
05:33:55.030 --> 05:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
be educated to me I don't believe the
 
05:33:56.830 --> 05:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire should be telling
 
05:34:00.470 --> 05:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
me or anyone what classes can or can uh
 
05:34:02.230 --> 05:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
be taken and what can be
 
05:34:04.788 --> 05:34:04.798 align:start position:0%
offered uh it also seems to me as
 
05:34:06.590 --> 05:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
previous speakers have said to be an
 
05:34:09.350 --> 05:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
issue of uh First Amendment rights being
 
05:34:12.350 --> 05:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
trampled on uh this bill also seems to
 
05:34:14.390 --> 05:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
go against the free marketplace with in
 
05:34:18.510 --> 05:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
regard to uh uh uh opportunities for
 
05:34:22.270 --> 05:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
Education H in the University system and
 
05:34:24.590 --> 05:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
what by that what I mean is that if no
 
05:34:26.910 --> 05:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
one is interested in having these
 
05:34:29.510 --> 05:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
conversations around the uh topics that
 
05:34:31.150 --> 05:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
were're disc discussing today then
 
05:34:33.070 --> 05:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
people will not attend and if people are
 
05:34:35.070 --> 05:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
interested in learning and having
 
05:34:37.430 --> 05:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
conversations they will I don't
 
05:34:40.510 --> 05:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
understand um the fear that it it seems
 
05:34:42.948 --> 05:34:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh some people are experiencing my
 
05:34:46.470 --> 05:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
ancestors left England in 1660 as best
 
05:34:48.548 --> 05:34:48.558 align:start position:0%
uh I've been able to figure out to
 
05:34:50.948 --> 05:34:50.958 align:start position:0%
escape oppression and experience the
 
05:34:53.110 --> 05:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
Free World I don't want the state of New
 
05:34:54.910 --> 05:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire telling me as I said what I
 
05:34:58.990 --> 05:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
can learn about um I also uh maybe the
 
05:35:01.990 --> 05:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
10th Generation a family farm but I'm
 
05:35:04.270 --> 05:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
also recognizing that there were many
 
05:35:06.510 --> 05:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
generations before my family who lived
 
05:35:08.510 --> 05:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
on this same land and I think it's
 
05:35:11.510 --> 05:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
important for me to learn and grow and
 
05:35:14.390 --> 05:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
understand uh how these people were
 
05:35:16.510 --> 05:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
oppressed and how these and the plight
 
05:35:18.948 --> 05:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
of these people and I'm Not Afraid about
 
05:35:20.708 --> 05:35:20.718 align:start position:0%
learning about that and I'm afraid I'm
 
05:35:23.990 --> 05:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
not afraid to admit that uh uh this
 
05:35:26.350 --> 05:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
oppression existed personally I've
 
05:35:28.788 --> 05:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
learned a lot in the last few years on
 
05:35:31.910 --> 05:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
many issues um I've learned that racism
 
05:35:34.270 --> 05:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
in a more deeply way I've known racism
 
05:35:35.990 --> 05:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
exists but I've learned in a more deeply
 
05:35:38.670 --> 05:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
way that it exists uh in our country and
 
05:35:41.070 --> 05:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
about my own personal privilege uh as a
 
05:35:44.430 --> 05:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
person whose skin by birth is white um I
 
05:35:46.390 --> 05:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
look forward to learning more about this
 
05:35:49.990 --> 05:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
and again I'm not afraid to do so uh it
 
05:35:53.350 --> 05:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
may be worth noting that uh the FBI
 
05:35:55.910 --> 05:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
recently determined that the greatest uh
 
05:35:58.150 --> 05:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
threat to National Security is domestic
 
05:36:00.230 --> 05:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
white nationalist groups
 
05:36:03.708 --> 05:36:03.718 align:start position:0%
um I think that um that may be a stretch
 
05:36:05.470 --> 05:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
for the conversation of today but I
 
05:36:07.110 --> 05:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
think it's background material is really
 
05:36:09.510 --> 05:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
important for us to uh understand that
 
05:36:12.868 --> 05:36:12.878 align:start position:0%
being open to this conversation um and
 
05:36:14.350 --> 05:36:14.360 align:start position:0%
uh and issues like this are really
 
05:36:15.750 --> 05:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
important for our country to come
 
05:36:17.750 --> 05:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
together I don't think again it's the
 
05:36:20.350 --> 05:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire's job to in any
 
05:36:24.150 --> 05:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
way legislate uh what professors or
 
05:36:27.910 --> 05:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
teachers uh can uh speak to and I
 
05:36:30.030 --> 05:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
respectfully uh request that the
 
05:36:33.708 --> 05:36:33.718 align:start position:0%
committee uh vote against House Bill 544
 
05:36:36.708 --> 05:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr
 
05:36:49.150 --> 05:36:49.160 align:start position:0%

Davidson Madame chairman can you hear me
 
05:36:54.990 --> 05:36:55.000 align:start position:0%

list of PowerPoint slides which I
 
05:37:01.470 --> 05:37:01.480 align:start position:0%

05:37:02.788 --> 05:37:02.798 align:start position:0%

05:37:06.470 --> 05:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
speak to them uh in short order
 
05:37:09.350 --> 05:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
no no Mr Davidson I'm not going to
 
05:37:12.430 --> 05:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
present your slides we have them we will
 
05:37:15.030 --> 05:37:15.040 align:start position:0%

05:37:16.548 --> 05:37:16.558 align:start position:0%

us very good if you can follow along
 
05:37:21.190 --> 05:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
that would be great so my my first my
 
05:37:23.708 --> 05:37:23.718 align:start position:0%
first thought uh is just my background
 
05:37:25.350 --> 05:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
is I'm a former public high school
 
05:37:27.110 --> 05:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
teacher I used to teach American
 
05:37:28.750 --> 05:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
government and afro Asian cultural
 
05:37:28.760 --> 05:37:30.270 align:start position:0%
government and afro Asian cultural
studies

05:37:30.270 --> 05:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
studies
 
05:37:32.390 --> 05:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh I'm a former ranking member of the
 
05:37:33.990 --> 05:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
House Brookline Cooperative School
 
05:37:36.470 --> 05:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
District budget committee I'm a
 
05:37:39.990 --> 05:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
multi-generational uh uh member of a
 
05:37:42.708 --> 05:37:42.718 align:start position:0%
mixed race family uh my children are
 
05:37:46.070 --> 05:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
also part of abanaki and Cherokee and uh
 
05:37:48.150 --> 05:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
I've received uh Public Service Awards
 
05:37:50.670 --> 05:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
in over two States including JC's and
 
05:37:53.910 --> 05:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
from the town of Hollis so uh my first
 
05:37:56.070 --> 05:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
slide was any discrimination versus
 
05:37:58.830 --> 05:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
critical race Theory and I I rise in
 
05:38:01.548 --> 05:38:01.558 align:start position:0%
support of HB
 
05:38:04.628 --> 05:38:04.638 align:start position:0%
544 uh discrimination is discrimination
 
05:38:07.548 --> 05:38:07.558 align:start position:0%
and a theory is an unproven thought and
 
05:38:09.110 --> 05:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
those are the takeaways I want you to
 
05:38:11.910 --> 05:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
have for uh for anti-discrimination and
 
05:38:15.628 --> 05:38:15.638 align:start position:0%
critical race Theory so are we there yet
 
05:38:17.750 --> 05:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
well I have friends who were Freedom
 
05:38:20.470 --> 05:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
Writers in Mississippi back in the 1960s
 
05:38:22.868 --> 05:38:22.878 align:start position:0%
and they were held hostage by the Jim
 
05:38:25.110 --> 05:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
Crow types for several days before they
 
05:38:27.470 --> 05:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
were released and I remember my father's
 
05:38:28.788 --> 05:38:28.798 align:start position:0%
best friend's family when we were
 
05:38:30.110 --> 05:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
sitting Vig
 
05:38:31.948 --> 05:38:31.958 align:start position:0%
from Father Jim feny who was held
 
05:38:34.548 --> 05:38:34.558 align:start position:0%
hostage when Robert Kennedy from the
 
05:38:36.270 --> 05:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
White House as the Attorney General
 
05:38:38.270 --> 05:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
called our friend's house and said that
 
05:38:41.190 --> 05:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
our friend had been released so if the
 
05:38:44.110 --> 05:38:44.120 align:start position:0%
60s was about anything it was about what
 
05:38:46.590 --> 05:38:46.600 align:start position:0%
Martin Luther King said I dream of a day
 
05:38:48.510 --> 05:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
when my four children will not be judged
 
05:38:50.070 --> 05:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
by the color of their skin but by the
 
05:38:52.430 --> 05:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
content of their character that is
 
05:38:54.590 --> 05:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
really the essence of what I think
 
05:38:56.548 --> 05:38:56.558 align:start position:0%
antidiscrimination and critical race
 
05:38:59.910 --> 05:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
theory is all about now are we there yet
 
05:39:02.190 --> 05:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
well who maybe I'm not the best to say
 
05:39:05.350 --> 05:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
but ask alv King Dr Ben Carson Michael
 
05:39:08.190 --> 05:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
Jordan financier Charles Pay Candace
 
05:39:10.910 --> 05:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
Owens actor Morgan Freeman and justi as
 
05:39:13.070 --> 05:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
Claris thommen if we're here that
 
05:39:15.070 --> 05:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
virtually all of them came from Humble
 
05:39:18.230 --> 05:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
means and Rose to what they Rose to I
 
05:39:20.990 --> 05:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
don't have to tell you so uh I want to
 
05:39:22.670 --> 05:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that that to me is the
 
05:39:24.788 --> 05:39:24.798 align:start position:0%
essence and The Benchmark of what we
 
05:39:26.310 --> 05:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
should be doing the I Have a Dream
 
05:39:27.948 --> 05:39:27.958 align:start position:0%
statement of Dr
 
05:39:31.628 --> 05:39:31.638 align:start position:0%
King uh here in Hollis we have a Dei
 
05:39:33.350 --> 05:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
committee diversity equity and inclusion
 
05:39:35.150 --> 05:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
committee and basically the message is
 
05:39:37.390 --> 05:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
to get woke and have it attended some of
 
05:39:39.390 --> 05:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
the the meetings and spoken to some of
 
05:39:41.590 --> 05:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
those who were members it's clear to me
 
05:39:45.670 --> 05:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
that empirical data is being replaced by
 
05:39:49.110 --> 05:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
Theory and repace replaced by consensus
 
05:39:51.670 --> 05:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
building uh that's one of the real
 
05:39:56.990 --> 05:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
drawbacks of uh the critical race theory
 
05:40:01.350 --> 05:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
is that they pit Equity versus equality
 
05:40:03.910 --> 05:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
Equity being equal outcome and equality
 
05:40:06.390 --> 05:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
basically being equal opportunity in
 
05:40:09.230 --> 05:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
fact the committee that's here in Hollis
 
05:40:10.708 --> 05:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
it's actually with the co-op Hollis
 
05:40:13.948 --> 05:40:13.958 align:start position:0%
Brookline SAU 41 actually is redefining
 
05:40:16.670 --> 05:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
Equity to mean equal opportunity so you
 
05:40:18.150 --> 05:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
know words mean things as they're
 
05:40:19.788 --> 05:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
written in the dictionary whether you go
 
05:40:21.390 --> 05:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
to Wikipedia or whether you go to
 
05:40:23.510 --> 05:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
britanica or you go to Webster and
 
05:40:26.270 --> 05:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
Equity means equal outcome equality of
 
05:40:29.150 --> 05:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity means just that so there's a
 
05:40:31.708 --> 05:40:31.718 align:start position:0%
a a clear deconomy between outcome
 
05:40:33.990 --> 05:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
versus opportunity and and they used and
 
05:40:36.548 --> 05:40:36.558 align:start position:0%
I'll use the analogy of running a race
 
05:40:39.110 --> 05:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
if it's 100 meter race you all start at
 
05:40:42.030 --> 05:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
the at the start line the shot goes off
 
05:40:44.708 --> 05:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
people run down the 100 meters then they
 
05:40:46.948 --> 05:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
finish first second or third or whatever
 
05:40:48.830 --> 05:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
but in an equity world everybody
 
05:40:50.510 --> 05:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
finishes at the same
 
05:40:52.750 --> 05:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
time and they use the term building
 
05:40:55.350 --> 05:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
Equity Building Equity is critical race
 
05:40:58.270 --> 05:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
Theory and it's it's it's not a it's not
 
05:41:00.350 --> 05:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
an effort of discover y it's an effort
 
05:41:00.360 --> 05:41:01.350 align:start position:0%
an effort of discover y it's an effort
of

05:41:01.350 --> 05:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:41:03.750 --> 05:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
advocacy now moving
 
05:41:07.708 --> 05:41:07.718 align:start position:0%
forward when you invoke the strategies
 
05:41:09.390 --> 05:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
of the diverse inequity inclusion
 
05:41:11.868 --> 05:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
committees and critical race Theory you
 
05:41:13.230 --> 05:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
basically look at everything through a
 
05:41:16.788 --> 05:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
prism of racism so all of society is
 
05:41:19.270 --> 05:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
viewed for that prism of racism personal
 
05:41:21.670 --> 05:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
and group identity is viewed that way
 
05:41:24.190 --> 05:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
and the groups are defined as as as the
 
05:41:26.750 --> 05:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
dominant versus the subordinate so you
 
05:41:28.510 --> 05:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
have the oppressors and you have the
 
05:41:28.520 --> 05:41:29.868 align:start position:0%
have the oppressors and you have the
victims

05:41:29.868 --> 05:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
victims
 
05:41:32.430 --> 05:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
and again looking through that prism all
 
05:41:34.788 --> 05:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
of our laws institutions and history are
 
05:41:37.590 --> 05:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
inherently racist the further these
 
05:41:39.788 --> 05:41:39.798 align:start position:0%
inequalities must be corrected through
 
05:41:41.548 --> 05:41:41.558 align:start position:0%
equity and that's the distribution of
 
05:41:44.110 --> 05:41:44.120 align:start position:0%
wealth and resources and in that the
 
05:41:46.510 --> 05:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
Norms of our society changed our society
 
05:41:48.230 --> 05:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
no longer is a
 
05:41:51.990 --> 05:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
meritocracy in that prism of racism view
 
05:41:55.390 --> 05:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
public and private bonds are weakened
 
05:41:58.548 --> 05:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
and education is not one of Discovery as
 
05:42:00.990 --> 05:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
in a atic method but indeed
 
05:42:02.868 --> 05:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
indoctrination and one of the remarks
 
05:42:04.670 --> 05:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned by some of the earlier
 
05:42:07.350 --> 05:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
speakers haven't worked Beyond teaching
 
05:42:09.510 --> 05:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
in it and contract law I'm not an
 
05:42:11.390 --> 05:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
attorney but I I've worked in them there
 
05:42:13.110 --> 05:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
are several opportunities to show where
 
05:42:16.070 --> 05:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
there's equal opportunity in in in the
 
05:42:18.150 --> 05:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
in the companies and agencies that might
 
05:42:19.868 --> 05:42:19.878 align:start position:0%
do business with the state and that's
 
05:42:22.110 --> 05:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
done today through eeo so there's many
 
05:42:26.070 --> 05:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
proven models to do that so when you
 
05:42:28.788 --> 05:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
look at uh when you look at the critical
 
05:42:31.868 --> 05:42:31.878 align:start position:0%
race further white people Foster
 
05:42:33.390 --> 05:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
differences that create have created
 
05:42:35.030 --> 05:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
this inequality and they're they're
 
05:42:35.948 --> 05:42:35.958 align:start position:0%
they're the
 
05:42:38.750 --> 05:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
boogeyman they're their inequalities are
 
05:42:41.150 --> 05:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
systemic and they're ones of subjugation
 
05:42:44.070 --> 05:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
and they create poverty and I said to
 
05:42:46.390 --> 05:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
the the the sa and the co-op here in
 
05:42:48.830 --> 05:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
Hollis Brookline if indeed we have
 
05:42:52.350 --> 05:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
systemic racism in in this town or for
 
05:42:54.110 --> 05:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
that matter in this state then where are
 
05:42:56.510 --> 05:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
the incident reports that have been
 
05:42:58.510 --> 05:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
filed through the schools where are the
 
05:43:00.868 --> 05:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
police reports where have the people
 
05:43:03.468 --> 05:43:03.478 align:start position:0%
been using the rsas to correct these
 
05:43:05.390 --> 05:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
inadequacies because clearly they would
 
05:43:07.190 --> 05:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
be if they had been occurring and if
 
05:43:09.350 --> 05:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
they've been systemic and if there is
 
05:43:12.070 --> 05:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
not this data then then you have to
 
05:43:14.830 --> 05:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
intellectually reject this because these
 
05:43:17.708 --> 05:43:17.718 align:start position:0%
events have not been filed and actions
 
05:43:19.468 --> 05:43:19.478 align:start position:0%
have not been taken in a legal manner
 
05:43:21.590 --> 05:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
which there are many Provisions for and
 
05:43:24.030 --> 05:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
that we would encourage them to do if
 
05:43:25.830 --> 05:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
indeed they were
 
05:43:28.510 --> 05:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
real uh the end game is to normalize
 
05:43:32.468 --> 05:43:32.478 align:start position:0%
this whole methodology of advocacy and
 
05:43:36.110 --> 05:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
and pushing theories and uh you know
 
05:43:38.948 --> 05:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
when you look at having studied Mao and
 
05:43:41.788 --> 05:43:41.798 align:start position:0%
the red guards the olinsky strategies
 
05:43:44.788 --> 05:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
blem and Tifa which
 
05:43:49.150 --> 05:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
are groups well BLM is a corporation
 
05:43:50.628 --> 05:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
which actually is trying to destroy the
 
05:43:52.830 --> 05:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
nuclear family their strategies are
 
05:43:54.590 --> 05:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
dividing conquer they're about
 
05:43:57.110 --> 05:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
reparations and they're about
 
05:43:59.830 --> 05:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
unlearning so uh I have some slides
 
05:44:02.070 --> 05:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
please take a look at them then show one
 
05:44:03.868 --> 05:44:03.878 align:start position:0%
of the questions that came out before
 
05:44:06.310 --> 05:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
critical a race theory is actively being
 
05:44:10.948 --> 05:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
taught there was a uh recently a uh a
 
05:44:12.948 --> 05:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
school district the Meer Hol School
 
05:44:15.830 --> 05:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
District in copertino San Jose where
 
05:44:18.510 --> 05:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
they advocated power and privilege being
 
05:44:20.670 --> 05:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
identified by whether and this is third
 
05:44:22.830 --> 05:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
graders are you white are you middle
 
05:44:25.150 --> 05:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
class are you cisgender are you
 
05:44:27.510 --> 05:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
cisgender male are you educated are you
 
05:44:30.190 --> 05:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
able-bodied those are all identities
 
05:44:31.990 --> 05:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
that hold power and privilege of one
 
05:44:34.110 --> 05:44:34.120 align:start position:0%
over the other and that was in the
 
05:44:37.948 --> 05:44:37.958 align:start position:0%
curriculum likewise in Hollis I included
 
05:44:40.910 --> 05:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
a summary of a letter that our uh
 
05:44:44.030 --> 05:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
petition group here in Hollis to get to
 
05:44:47.070 --> 05:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
stop critical race Theory took notes
 
05:44:50.910 --> 05:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
going as far back as October
 
05:44:53.628 --> 05:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
2020 where they talked about white
 
05:44:56.430 --> 05:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
people being the subjugators and I quote
 
05:44:58.150 --> 05:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
white people are the only ones who can
 
05:45:01.030 --> 05:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:01.040 --> 05:45:01.868 align:start position:0%
 
white

05:45:01.868 --> 05:45:01.878 align:start position:0%
white
 
05:45:05.110 --> 05:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
people treat people very badly because
 
05:45:07.830 --> 05:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
they have power they cause racism they
 
05:45:09.948 --> 05:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
created slavery they brought it to this
 
05:45:12.030 --> 05:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
country and this is directly from a
 
05:45:14.628 --> 05:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
letter from aah Hollis grade two and
 
05:45:16.468 --> 05:45:16.478 align:start position:0%
three parent because this transcended
 
05:45:20.670 --> 05:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
the year of a a parent in Hollis and I
 
05:45:22.150 --> 05:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
can send you the letter with the
 
05:45:25.468 --> 05:45:25.478 align:start position:0%
permission of the author with their name
 
05:45:27.430 --> 05:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and their his wife's name
 
05:45:30.350 --> 05:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
redacted and as ask him to uh speak to
 
05:45:32.350 --> 05:45:32.360 align:start position:0%
the committee in private because he's a
 
05:45:34.990 --> 05:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
he's afraid of repercussions against his
 
05:45:38.230 --> 05:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
family and against his child so in
 
05:45:41.948 --> 05:45:41.958 align:start position:0%
summary the prism of Iden the prism of
 
05:45:44.830 --> 05:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
identity politics and race I ask you
 
05:45:47.708 --> 05:45:47.718 align:start position:0%
intellectually will it nurture and teach
 
05:45:49.708 --> 05:45:49.718 align:start position:0%
and Foster self-confidence of our
 
05:45:52.190 --> 05:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
children and of our of our peer groups
 
05:45:54.230 --> 05:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
whether professional or otherwise will
 
05:45:56.868 --> 05:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
it bring us together will it forer
 
05:45:59.708 --> 05:45:59.718 align:start position:0%
confidence in our community and I I
 
05:46:01.070 --> 05:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
think the answer to those things is
 
05:46:03.468 --> 05:46:03.478 align:start position:0%
clear as this is a divis of exercise at
 
05:46:05.628 --> 05:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
its core and I also want to stress from
 
05:46:08.270 --> 05:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
an educational standpoint as I also made
 
05:46:11.110 --> 05:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
this presentation to sau41 will it
 
05:46:13.468 --> 05:46:13.478 align:start position:0%
improve our math and reading scores here
 
05:46:17.350 --> 05:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
we are in Hollis we still we we still
 
05:46:20.468 --> 05:46:20.478 align:start position:0%
only have a 32% Proficiency in uh in
 
05:46:23.270 --> 05:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
math um pardon me we have 32% of our
 
05:46:25.310 --> 05:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
students who are not proficient in
 
05:46:27.670 --> 05:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
mathematics at grade level in the high
 
05:46:30.270 --> 05:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
school and 14 % are not proficient in
 
05:46:32.590 --> 05:46:32.600 align:start position:0%
reading and I think part of this is an
 
05:46:35.110 --> 05:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
obfuscation of responsibility from an
 
05:46:37.310 --> 05:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
educational process standpoint because
 
05:46:39.868 --> 05:46:39.878 align:start position:0%
it takes our Focus off the core
 
05:46:42.628 --> 05:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
responsibility of basic skills in
 
05:46:45.990 --> 05:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
education so again I ask you to vote
 
05:46:49.910 --> 05:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
against discrimination okay I
 
05:46:52.548 --> 05:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
discrimination is discrimination and I
 
05:46:57.230 --> 05:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
ask you to choose to support
 
05:47:01.070 --> 05:47:01.080 align:start position:0%

05:47:13.070 --> 05:47:13.080 align:start position:0%

05:47:24.430 --> 05:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
question yes you can choose not to call
 
05:47:26.990 --> 05:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
on me I guess but my question is you
 
05:47:29.110 --> 05:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there a lot of school
 
05:47:31.150 --> 05:47:31.160 align:start position:0%
systems Etc that you've raised this
 
05:47:34.750 --> 05:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
issue with did you ask anyone that is a
 
05:47:38.070 --> 05:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
person of color their view on this well
 
05:47:39.628 --> 05:47:39.638 align:start position:0%
actually I didn't say that I raised it
 
05:47:42.390 --> 05:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
up in many school systems I went through
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
Discovery and I I noted that the uh to
 
05:47:46.468 --> 05:47:46.478 align:start position:0%
answer your question I think where
 
05:47:48.750 --> 05:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
you're going with this the meero school
 
05:47:51.830 --> 05:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
in copertino San Jose California is 70%
 
05:47:54.270 --> 05:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
Asian and a large majority of those
 
05:47:56.430 --> 05:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
individual parents 70
 
05:47:59.948 --> 05:47:59.958 align:start position:0%
percentile uh are a foreign born and
 
05:48:02.030 --> 05:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
they're immigrants to this country and
 
05:48:04.230 --> 05:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
it was they that raised this up at the
 
05:48:08.390 --> 05:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
meero school and uh where the advocate
 
05:48:10.868 --> 05:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
who was against uh the critical race
 
05:48:13.430 --> 05:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
Theory who is an Asian woman spoke very
 
05:48:15.190 --> 05:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
strongly and in fact was on Fox News
 
05:48:16.948 --> 05:48:16.958 align:start position:0%
speaking against the slides that I
 
05:48:19.788 --> 05:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
forwarded to you that were used in the
 
05:48:22.468 --> 05:48:22.478 align:start position:0%
curriculum okay so you ask no person of
 
05:48:26.750 --> 05:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
color thank you well Madam chairman I
 
05:48:29.310 --> 05:48:29.320 align:start position:0%

on the on the diversity Equity inclusion
 
05:48:37.548 --> 05:48:37.558 align:start position:0%

Maguire and members of the New Hampshire
 
05:49:10.830 --> 05:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
house Edna committee my name is Melissa
 
05:49:13.628 --> 05:49:13.638 align:start position:0%
Bernardin I live in conquer and I've
 
05:49:15.670 --> 05:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
resided in New Hampshire for most of my
 
05:49:19.510 --> 05:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
life I signed up to speak on HB 544
 
05:49:22.628 --> 05:49:22.638 align:start position:0%
today because it appears to me one of
 
05:49:25.150 --> 05:49:25.160 align:start position:0%
the most backward thinking intolerant
 
05:49:27.270 --> 05:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation I've seen come
 
05:49:29.110 --> 05:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
through this house and I've been
 
05:49:31.110 --> 05:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
involved in public policy work in New
 
05:49:32.990 --> 05:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for nearly two
 
05:49:35.868 --> 05:49:35.878 align:start position:0%
decades I see words and phrases in this
 
05:49:38.190 --> 05:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
legislation that smack of the sentiment
 
05:49:40.110 --> 05:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
we've heard in recent months from people
 
05:49:42.990 --> 05:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
who want to preserve the racist status
 
05:49:46.070 --> 05:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
quo in this country like talking about
 
05:49:47.750 --> 05:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
racism divides
 
05:49:50.150 --> 05:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
us this line of thinking couldn't be
 
05:49:52.830 --> 05:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
farther from the truth talking about
 
05:49:54.948 --> 05:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
problems and weaknesses in the ways that
 
05:49:58.670 --> 05:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
we think speak and act and then figure
 
05:50:00.510 --> 05:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
out ways to better understand and
 
05:50:03.548 --> 05:50:03.558 align:start position:0%
support each other will make our state
 
05:50:07.868 --> 05:50:07.878 align:start position:0%
stronger and more united not more
 
05:50:10.548 --> 05:50:10.558 align:start position:0%
divided most Americans believe that
 
05:50:12.910 --> 05:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
America is about progress seeking
 
05:50:15.270 --> 05:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
improvements and bettering ourselves
 
05:50:17.830 --> 05:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
instead this bill would plug our ears
 
05:50:19.708 --> 05:50:19.718 align:start position:0%
and close our eyes and ignore the
 
05:50:23.070 --> 05:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
scourges of racism sexism ableism and
 
05:50:25.910 --> 05:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
all the other horrid ableism that divide
 
05:50:27.990 --> 05:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
us and rank some individuals Supreme
 
05:50:30.468 --> 05:50:30.478 align:start position:0%
over others others it brings shame to
 
05:50:32.788 --> 05:50:32.798 align:start position:0%
our state that legislation like this
 
05:50:35.070 --> 05:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
which would curtail freedom of speech
 
05:50:37.788 --> 05:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
freedom of study freedom of debate and
 
05:50:41.468 --> 05:50:41.478 align:start position:0%
dialogue would even be suggested I urge
 
05:50:44.510 --> 05:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
this committee to vote itl on HB
 
05:50:47.030 --> 05:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
544 and in closing I would like to leave
 
05:50:48.670 --> 05:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
the supporters of this bill with a
 
05:50:51.190 --> 05:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
thought as white people we are not
 
05:50:53.110 --> 05:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
harmed by being called
 
05:50:56.310 --> 05:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
racist in contrast people who are not
 
05:51:00.030 --> 05:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
white are harmed when we don't name
 
05:51:03.070 --> 05:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
examine and work to deconstruct racism
 
05:51:07.350 --> 05:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
in our society I have not yet sent in uh
 
05:51:09.310 --> 05:51:09.320 align:start position:0%
written testimony but I would be happy
 
05:51:12.990 --> 05:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
to I'll briefly make one more statement
 
05:51:15.868 --> 05:51:15.878 align:start position:0%
the and and speaks to
 
05:51:19.670 --> 05:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:23.670 --> 05:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
testimony I I don't appreciate your
 
05:51:27.070 --> 05:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
stating your opinions as facts quite
 
05:51:29.670 --> 05:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
that firmly and I would hope that you
 
05:51:32.030 --> 05:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
would be more respectful to those white
 
05:51:33.410 --> 05:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
people in the
 
05:51:33.420 --> 05:51:34.548 align:start position:0%
people in the
[Music]

05:51:34.548 --> 05:51:34.558 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:51:37.150 --> 05:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
audience many of whom are offended if
 
05:51:49.110 --> 05:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:53.710 --> 05:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:53.720 --> 05:51:57.070 align:start position:0%

05:52:00.270 --> 05:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
Ruba okay okay uh looks like I got video
 
05:52:03.310 --> 05:52:03.320 align:start position:0%
can you folks hear me yes thank you okay
 
05:52:05.590 --> 05:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
great thank you uh my name is Joe garuba
 
05:52:09.150 --> 05:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm testifying today uh for myself
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
and for my two children who uh attend
 
05:52:15.310 --> 05:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
school here in Hollis New Hampshire um I
 
05:52:17.310 --> 05:52:17.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to start off with a couple of
 
05:52:19.670 --> 05:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
observations and maybe a question before
 
05:52:23.270 --> 05:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
I got to my um prepared comments uh I'll
 
05:52:26.910 --> 05:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
be brief um first thing is I think
 
05:52:29.548 --> 05:52:29.558 align:start position:0%
there's some confusion about the concept
 
05:52:33.310 --> 05:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
of free speech in the framework of uh
 
05:52:36.310 --> 05:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
public education so people most
 
05:52:38.788 --> 05:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
certainly have the right of their free
 
05:52:41.270 --> 05:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
speech right to claim that New Hampshire
 
05:52:44.868 --> 05:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
is a systematically systemically racist
 
05:52:46.910 --> 05:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
State that's that's their free speech
 
05:52:50.110 --> 05:52:50.120 align:start position:0%
right but that's very different from the
 
05:52:53.910 --> 05:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
right to take tax dollars and to have
 
05:52:57.510 --> 05:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
those those Concepts taught to people's
 
05:53:01.190 --> 05:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
children so when everybody's questioning
 
05:53:03.310 --> 05:53:03.320 align:start position:0%
this bill and the content of this bill
 
05:53:05.708 --> 05:53:05.718 align:start position:0%
in in the light of a a free speech
 
05:53:08.830 --> 05:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
context it really has to be viewed from
 
05:53:11.750 --> 05:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
the from the standpoint of we're talking
 
05:53:14.350 --> 05:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
about teachers who are teaching children
 
05:53:17.628 --> 05:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
impressionable children um Concepts that
 
05:53:19.590 --> 05:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
are obviously quite controversial
 
05:53:20.910 --> 05:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
because we wouldn't all be here with
 
05:53:22.590 --> 05:53:22.600 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people on the line talking
 
05:53:25.030 --> 05:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
about them if this was uh you know 2
 
05:53:28.590 --> 05:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
plus 2 equals 4 so that was the first
 
05:53:30.430 --> 05:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
thing I I just wanted to address I saw
 
05:53:31.868 --> 05:53:31.878 align:start position:0%
as we were going through the testimony
 
05:53:34.548 --> 05:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
the second thing is I've heard quite a
 
05:53:36.910 --> 05:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
few folks mention that they have
 
05:53:39.390 --> 05:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony or will be
 
05:53:42.750 --> 05:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
submitting written testimony and um it's
 
05:53:45.110 --> 05:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
my understanding that those would be uh
 
05:53:47.030 --> 05:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
government records and I wanted to know
 
05:53:50.150 --> 05:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
if that would be available for uh folks
 
05:53:52.510 --> 05:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
who are interested uh to review as well
 
05:53:55.750 --> 05:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
as committee members yes they are still
 
05:53:58.430 --> 05:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
being collected and I don't can't
 
05:54:00.868 --> 05:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
guarantee that you could get them today
 
05:54:03.990 --> 05:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
but the written testimony is submitted
 
05:54:06.590 --> 05:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's in the bill file and it is a public
 
05:54:09.750 --> 05:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
document as you stated great thank you
 
05:54:12.430 --> 05:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
um I just have a brief uh comment on
 
05:54:14.628 --> 05:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
critical race Theory and then I'll take
 
05:54:16.868 --> 05:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
uh questions if anybody has any so
 
05:54:19.030 --> 05:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
critical race Theory uh does not
 
05:54:22.110 --> 05:54:22.120 align:start position:0%
distinguish between benevolent Authority
 
05:54:24.708 --> 05:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
and oppression to critical race
 
05:54:27.830 --> 05:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
theorists all authority is oppressive
 
05:54:29.830 --> 05:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
and in essence you know the the New
 
05:54:31.510 --> 05:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State House is a pressive
 
05:54:35.110 --> 05:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
Authority and and it doesn't it doesn't
 
05:54:37.230 --> 05:54:37.240 align:start position:0%
understand or the concept isn't the
 
05:54:40.230 --> 05:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
differentiation between Authority used
 
05:54:42.990 --> 05:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
in a positive way is not differentiated
 
05:54:45.708 --> 05:54:45.718 align:start position:0%
and that's where you get all of these
 
05:54:48.230 --> 05:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
all of these kind of distortions that
 
05:54:50.310 --> 05:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
come out of out of applying this theory
 
05:54:53.750 --> 05:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
in the real world so what what I would
 
05:54:56.510 --> 05:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to do is specifically
 
05:55:01.270 --> 05:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
to vote the HB 544 as ought to pass and
 
05:55:03.628 --> 05:55:03.638 align:start position:0%
ensure that the state can continue to
 
05:55:06.590 --> 05:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
improve on race relations instead of
 
05:55:09.590 --> 05:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
having critical race Theory cause
 
05:55:11.510 --> 05:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
divisions which is the outcome of the
 
05:55:14.070 --> 05:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
implementation of that theory so if
 
05:55:15.590 --> 05:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
anybody had any questions I'd be happy
 
05:55:19.830 --> 05:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:22.070 --> 05:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
them no I think you've made your point
 
05:55:23.990 --> 05:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
very nicely thank you very much for your
 
05:55:27.628 --> 05:55:27.638 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you ma'am sure yes one
 
05:55:28.910 --> 05:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
of the people people who signed up to
 
05:55:33.070 --> 05:55:33.080 align:start position:0%
testify Lily Williams says that she's
 
05:55:36.510 --> 05:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
waiting but she has no video only audio
 
05:55:37.868 --> 05:55:37.878 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if there's anybody in a
 
05:55:39.670 --> 05:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
phone number I've asked her what number
 
05:55:41.590 --> 05:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
she's calling from but haven't heard
 
05:55:45.548 --> 05:55:45.558 align:start position:0%
that if she if you we could take video
 
05:55:47.670 --> 05:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
we can take Audio Only testimony we need
 
05:55:49.990 --> 05:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
to know who it is there's nobody with a
 
05:55:52.628 --> 05:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
phone who's raised their
 
05:55:55.910 --> 05:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
hand um that person raised their hand
 
05:55:57.548 --> 05:55:57.558 align:start position:0%
raise their hand we're calling those all
 
05:56:02.190 --> 05:56:02.200 align:start position:0%
right and and if it is a phone it's star
 
05:56:09.468 --> 05:56:09.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:13.070 --> 05:56:13.080 align:start position:0%

have lived the majority of my life in
 
05:56:32.750 --> 05:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
the granite state after immigrating here
 
05:56:36.070 --> 05:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
as a toddler in 1989 as a black girl I
 
05:56:37.750 --> 05:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
experienced schools that use my image to
 
05:56:39.708 --> 05:56:39.718 align:start position:0%
show diversity on their brochures while
 
05:56:42.868 --> 05:56:42.878 align:start position:0%
treating me like an alien as an an alien
 
05:56:45.190 --> 05:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
other in the classroom as a black woman
 
05:56:46.830 --> 05:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
I experienced employers purposely
 
05:56:48.548 --> 05:56:48.558 align:start position:0%
underpaying me compared to other White
 
05:56:50.070 --> 05:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
staff and threatening to fire me when I
 
05:56:52.030 --> 05:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
confronted them these are just some
 
05:56:54.510 --> 05:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
examples of the racism and that I in
 
05:56:57.030 --> 05:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
that I directly experienced as a granite
 
05:56:59.670 --> 05:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
Stater for the majority of the 33 years
 
05:57:01.628 --> 05:57:01.638 align:start position:0%
that I've lived here I'm here in
 
05:57:04.910 --> 05:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB 544 this is a bill
 
05:57:06.910 --> 05:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
written from a place of fear about the
 
05:57:08.750 --> 05:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
truth about the behaviors and choices of
 
05:57:10.910 --> 05:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
our social systems in the impact that
 
05:57:13.310 --> 05:57:13.320 align:start position:0%
those systems have had on past and
 
05:57:15.548 --> 05:57:15.558 align:start position:0%
current generations of people our
 
05:57:17.390 --> 05:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
discourse in decision- making is not
 
05:57:19.350 --> 05:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
weakened by critical analysis that
 
05:57:21.708 --> 05:57:21.718 align:start position:0%
challenges what we know pushes us to
 
05:57:23.670 --> 05:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
understand more deeply and it enables us
 
05:57:26.150 --> 05:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
to do better it is well documented and
 
05:57:27.990 --> 05:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
well researched that racial gender
 
05:57:30.468 --> 05:57:30.478 align:start position:0%
ableist and sexual inequities exist in
 
05:57:32.350 --> 05:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
public policy and disproportionately
 
05:57:34.548 --> 05:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
affect people of color disabled people
 
05:57:36.788 --> 05:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
women and gender non-conforming folks
 
05:57:38.350 --> 05:57:38.360 align:start position:0%
causing major disparities in the
 
05:57:40.670 --> 05:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
economic health and educational outcomes
 
05:57:41.750 --> 05:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
of these
 
05:57:44.390 --> 05:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
communities it is embarrassing and
 
05:57:46.468 --> 05:57:46.478 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking that our state continues
 
05:57:48.948 --> 05:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
to debate whether or not racism sexism
 
05:57:51.270 --> 05:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
and other isms exist while much of the
 
05:57:53.230 --> 05:57:53.240 align:start position:0%
country including our neighbors our
 
05:57:55.070 --> 05:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
regional neighbors like Maine are
 
05:57:56.708 --> 05:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
getting on with the business of rooting
 
05:57:58.590 --> 05:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
out oppression protecting against
 
05:58:00.468 --> 05:58:00.478 align:start position:0%
discrimination and building smarter and
 
05:58:02.868 --> 05:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
more inclusive societies it is crystal
 
05:58:04.350 --> 05:58:04.360 align:start position:0%
clear that the purpose of this bill is
 
05:58:06.510 --> 05:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
to muzzle the truth of who we are and
 
05:58:09.390 --> 05:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
what we do in closing these concepts are
 
05:58:11.910 --> 05:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
divisive divisive because of the harmful
 
05:58:14.110 --> 05:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
impact that discriminatory violence
 
05:58:16.750 --> 05:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
policies and choices have on those on
 
05:58:18.868 --> 05:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
the receiving end of it they are not
 
05:58:20.830 --> 05:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
divisive simply because those who have
 
05:58:23.110 --> 05:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
and continue to hold social political
 
05:58:25.510 --> 05:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
and economic power are uncomfortable and
 
05:58:27.230 --> 05:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
are using that power to push through a
 
05:58:29.310 --> 05:58:29.320 align:start position:0%
bill that will halt the trajectory of
 
05:58:32.070 --> 05:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
truth I urge this community to vote itl
 
05:58:35.310 --> 05:58:35.320 align:start position:0%
on HB 544 and I'm happy to take any
 
05:58:38.190 --> 05:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much uh
 
05:58:38.200 --> 05:58:39.590 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much uh
representative

05:58:39.590 --> 05:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:58:42.390 --> 05:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
Alro um I've never heard that the state
 
05:58:44.590 --> 05:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
of the Hampshire denies the existence of
 
05:58:47.468 --> 05:58:47.478 align:start position:0%
racism can you please uh provide me a
 
05:58:50.030 --> 05:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
reference so that I can educate myself I
 
05:58:51.350 --> 05:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
did just provide you a reference which
 
05:58:53.230 --> 05:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
is my some of my direct experiences in
 
05:58:56.670 --> 05:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
the schools and workplaces in the state
 
05:58:59.910 --> 05:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
the state Deni the existence of of
 
05:59:02.868 --> 05:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
racism and sexism right and as long as
 
05:59:04.628 --> 05:59:04.638 align:start position:0%
as long as the state denies it then I
 
05:59:06.230 --> 05:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
see that there is no need for a bill
 
05:59:07.990 --> 05:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
like this which would make it impossible
 
05:59:09.910 --> 05:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
for us to even speak of these things
 
05:59:15.628 --> 05:59:15.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:22.230 --> 05:59:22.240 align:start position:0%

Hampshire four years ago I'm an educator
 
06:00:15.030 --> 06:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
and have been for 25 years um and I urge
 
06:00:17.270 --> 06:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
that you oppose this
 
06:00:20.548 --> 06:00:20.558 align:start position:0%
B44 um I just in in the spirit of
 
06:00:23.590 --> 06:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
sharing personal experiences that people
 
06:00:25.270 --> 06:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
aren't aware of and it's important for
 
06:00:27.990 --> 06:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
everybody to be aware of um know as a
 
06:00:30.468 --> 06:00:30.478 align:start position:0%
newcomer to the state I was delighted to
 
06:00:33.750 --> 06:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
go to a um Workforce Development um
 
06:00:35.750 --> 06:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
meeting when I first moved to New
 
06:00:38.430 --> 06:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and you know signed in on
 
06:00:41.270 --> 06:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
the signin sheet like everybody else um
 
06:00:46.468 --> 06:00:46.478 align:start position:0%
and was stunned find out that um uh
 
06:00:49.350 --> 06:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
white supremacy groups um captured
 
06:00:51.150 --> 06:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
images of the signin sheets and then I
 
06:00:54.070 --> 06:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
was among many people who were put on a
 
06:00:56.830 --> 06:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
on a white hating list on the website
 
06:00:59.510 --> 06:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
with my photo aaph and my email and my
 
06:01:02.868 --> 06:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
phone number for my workplace um it is
 
06:01:04.708 --> 06:01:04.718 align:start position:0%
uh someone earlier said that that
 
06:01:06.190 --> 06:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
incidents don't happen because people
 
06:01:08.750 --> 06:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
don't report them and I can tell you
 
06:01:11.830 --> 06:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
that incidents do happen and oftentimes
 
06:01:13.750 --> 06:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
there's consequences for reporting them
 
06:01:17.830 --> 06:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
and uh you know in my workplace I was
 
06:01:19.910 --> 06:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
told that because it's free speech on
 
06:01:22.430 --> 06:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
the internet um of course you know it
 
06:01:24.430 --> 06:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
would only add Fu to the fire if I were
 
06:01:27.510 --> 06:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
to challenge that but it's an example of
 
06:01:30.350 --> 06:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
kind of I would say ignorance and and
 
06:01:32.150 --> 06:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
maliciousness and targeting that takes
 
06:01:35.150 --> 06:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
place and I just um my heart broke that
 
06:01:37.390 --> 06:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
I know a lot of people um are working
 
06:01:39.430 --> 06:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
against that kind of behavior but um
 
06:01:40.948 --> 06:01:40.958 align:start position:0%
just sharing with you that that does
 
06:01:44.230 --> 06:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
exist um in regarding this bill I think
 
06:01:47.830 --> 06:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
there's been a kind of conflating of um
 
06:01:47.840 --> 06:01:49.150 align:start position:0%
there's been a kind of conflating of um
you

06:01:49.150 --> 06:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:01:52.110 --> 06:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
know there's a there's a debate on
 
06:01:54.270 --> 06:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
critical race Theory and that will
 
06:01:57.430 --> 06:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
continue and that's fine um this bill in
 
06:01:59.510 --> 06:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
particular the it is it's a very
 
06:02:02.270 --> 06:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
misleadingly crafted bill um the key
 
06:02:04.990 --> 06:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
part in there about bias training there
 
06:02:07.110 --> 06:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
is so much data and evidence on the
 
06:02:09.030 --> 06:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
impact of some people call it
 
06:02:12.708 --> 06:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
unconscious bias implicit bias
 
06:02:15.590 --> 06:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
um basically if we're human beings and
 
06:02:17.910 --> 06:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
we breathe air we have bias it's not
 
06:02:19.830 --> 06:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
that we're bad people it's not any of
 
06:02:22.510 --> 06:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
that it's that we socialized that we you
 
06:02:24.628 --> 06:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
know we get socialized from all
 
06:02:26.910 --> 06:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
different sources in society and we then
 
06:02:30.070 --> 06:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
have bi so for example if I see two
 
06:02:32.708 --> 06:02:32.718 align:start position:0%
white male gentlemen one's wearing a
 
06:02:35.190 --> 06:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
denim jacket and one is wearing a suit
 
06:02:37.070 --> 06:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
I'm asked to pick out which one probably
 
06:02:38.788 --> 06:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
the banker and which one is the
 
06:02:41.350 --> 06:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
carpenter cognitive bias is just how the
 
06:02:43.430 --> 06:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
brain processes quickly it looks for
 
06:02:46.390 --> 06:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
patterns and so I would then be seeing
 
06:02:47.948 --> 06:02:47.958 align:start position:0%
you know I've been socialized that the
 
06:02:49.868 --> 06:02:49.878 align:start position:0%
person with the suit on is the banker
 
06:02:51.310 --> 06:02:51.320 align:start position:0%
when in fact it might not be the case
 
06:02:52.750 --> 06:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
that's an example of bias it's not
 
06:02:54.430 --> 06:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
something to be afraid of to learn about
 
06:02:57.070 --> 06:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
it and this bill hamstrings people work
 
06:02:59.310 --> 06:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
for uh an educational organization I
 
06:03:02.110 --> 06:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
have 700 employees and we need to be
 
06:03:02.120 --> 06:03:03.230 align:start position:0%
have 700 employees and we need to be
able

06:03:03.230 --> 06:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
able
 
06:03:05.990 --> 06:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
to make those trainings available to our
 
06:03:07.788 --> 06:03:07.798 align:start position:0%
employees so that they can do a good job
 
06:03:10.750 --> 06:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
in their work and helping them with
 
06:03:12.628 --> 06:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
unconscious bias really all we're doing
 
06:03:14.830 --> 06:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
is teaching people that it exists and
 
06:03:17.030 --> 06:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
then people have the ability to mitigate
 
06:03:18.948 --> 06:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
so that they can kind of catch
 
06:03:20.670 --> 06:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
themselves when they might be realizing
 
06:03:22.110 --> 06:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
that they're saying something with a
 
06:03:25.270 --> 06:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
bias um so I just again I just want to
 
06:03:27.230 --> 06:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
say that there there's this particular
 
06:03:29.788 --> 06:03:29.798 align:start position:0%
ular bill as it is constructed does way
 
06:03:32.750 --> 06:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
more harm than it than its um proponents
 
06:03:34.548 --> 06:03:34.558 align:start position:0%
are talking about and we need to be very
 
06:03:36.868 --> 06:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
very careful I urge you uh to vote down
 
06:03:38.868 --> 06:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
against this bill and to make New
 
06:03:40.230 --> 06:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a place where people can have
 
06:03:42.030 --> 06:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
the conversations they need to and learn
 
06:03:44.110 --> 06:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
together for a healthier
 
06:03:50.910 --> 06:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:54.548 --> 06:03:54.558 align:start position:0%
questions a question what C I think my
 
06:03:56.628 --> 06:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
video was off during that I apologize so
 
06:03:58.708 --> 06:03:58.718 align:start position:0%
please I'm happy to take questions
 
06:03:58.718 --> 06:03:59.590 align:start position:0%
please I'm happy to take questions
what's

06:03:59.590 --> 06:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
what's
 
06:04:02.390 --> 06:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
CDO CDO stands for chief diversity
 
06:04:04.150 --> 06:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
officer and I work for a small College
 
06:04:06.590 --> 06:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
where I do that work and I did want to
 
06:04:08.150 --> 06:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
just make a slight correction for
 
06:04:10.030 --> 06:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
someone who said that Equity is the same
 
06:04:12.670 --> 06:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
as equal opportunity it's not Equity is
 
06:04:15.070 --> 06:04:15.080 align:start position:0%
giving someone with dyslexia more time
 
06:04:17.708 --> 06:04:17.718 align:start position:0%
to take the test math
 
06:04:20.030 --> 06:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
test quality is giving everybody the
 
06:04:21.990 --> 06:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
same thing 50 minutes to take your math
 
06:04:25.468 --> 06:04:25.478 align:start position:0%
test Equity is giving someone who has
 
06:04:26.830 --> 06:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
giving people what they need so they can
 
06:04:28.628 --> 06:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
have equ opportunity it's not about
 
06:04:30.868 --> 06:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing outcomes it's about
 
06:04:32.390 --> 06:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
removing barriers so they have equal
 
06:04:34.270 --> 06:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
opportuni so if I have a student who's
 
06:04:36.910 --> 06:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
got dyslexia and that's documented in
 
06:04:38.868 --> 06:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
their you know in their um
 
06:04:41.468 --> 06:04:41.478 align:start position:0%
individualized uh forms then we give
 
06:04:43.350 --> 06:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
them more time to take their exam so we
 
06:04:45.190 --> 06:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
can actually measure their performance
 
06:04:47.350 --> 06:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
on math not whether they cognate really
 
06:04:49.150 --> 06:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
fast on numbers so I just wanted to
 
06:04:51.468 --> 06:04:51.478 align:start position:0%
clarify that yes that's the role thank
 
06:04:53.628 --> 06:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
you very much and Madam chair Willie
 
06:04:55.430 --> 06:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
Williams is having technical problem she
 
06:04:57.868 --> 06:04:57.878 align:start position:0%
should be on with her hand raised
 
06:04:59.708 --> 06:04:59.718 align:start position:0%
okay we're we're moving people up this
 
06:05:04.750 --> 06:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:06.948 --> 06:05:06.958 align:start position:0%
Madison um hi thank you so much for
 
06:05:09.788 --> 06:05:09.798 align:start position:0%
calling me um so my name is Madison
 
06:05:12.590 --> 06:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
Howard um I live uh here in Conquer New
 
06:05:14.510 --> 06:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about a mile away from the
 
06:05:16.990 --> 06:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
state house actually um I am a senior at
 
06:05:18.510 --> 06:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
conquered high school and I would like
 
06:05:20.350 --> 06:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
to speak today in strong opposition to
 
06:05:23.110 --> 06:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
HP 544 I'd like to start by saying that
 
06:05:25.110 --> 06:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
I have lived in New Hampshire for
 
06:05:27.110 --> 06:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
practically my entire life and I love
 
06:05:29.230 --> 06:05:29.240 align:start position:0%
living here but growing up as a
 
06:05:30.788 --> 06:05:30.798 align:start position:0%
korean-american in the third whitest
 
06:05:32.670 --> 06:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
state in the country has come with its
 
06:05:34.948 --> 06:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
challenges I've routinely faced racial
 
06:05:37.150 --> 06:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
harassment I've been called names and
 
06:05:38.868 --> 06:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
slurs that I won't repeat in front of
 
06:05:41.628 --> 06:05:41.638 align:start position:0%
the committee today um and I bring this
 
06:05:44.230 --> 06:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
up because if you ask any person of
 
06:05:46.948 --> 06:05:46.958 align:start position:0%
color if they have similar experiences I
 
06:05:49.350 --> 06:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
guarantee they will say yes and this is
 
06:05:52.510 --> 06:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
because racist behaviors um are so
 
06:05:54.390 --> 06:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
common because they are weaved into the
 
06:05:57.628 --> 06:05:57.638 align:start position:0%
fabric of our country let us not forget
 
06:05:59.270 --> 06:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
that our country was built on the labor
 
06:06:01.510 --> 06:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
of enslaved black Americans who far too
 
06:06:03.390 --> 06:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
many white Americans justified enslaving
 
06:06:06.670 --> 06:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
by asserting they were subhuman in 1833
 
06:06:09.070 --> 06:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
Andrew Jackson the Man still on our $20
 
06:06:11.548 --> 06:06:11.558 align:start position:0%
bills said of indigenous Americans as
 
06:06:13.350 --> 06:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
justification for his Mass extermination
 
06:06:14.788 --> 06:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
of them they have neither the
 
06:06:16.708 --> 06:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
intelligence the industry the moral
 
06:06:18.788 --> 06:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
habits nor the desire of improvement
 
06:06:20.590 --> 06:06:20.600 align:start position:0%
which are necessary to any favorable
 
06:06:22.990 --> 06:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
change in their condition during World
 
06:06:24.948 --> 06:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
War II Frank President Franklin D
 
06:06:27.628 --> 06:06:27.638 align:start position:0%
Roosevelt put 120,000 and Japanese
 
06:06:29.628 --> 06:06:29.638 align:start position:0%
Americans in internment camps and
 
06:06:31.750 --> 06:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
Justified this by calling them quote
 
06:06:34.788 --> 06:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
dangerous and undesirable unquote this
 
06:06:36.868 --> 06:06:36.878 align:start position:0%
is the reality of our country's history
 
06:06:38.868 --> 06:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
and it is vital that we recognize how
 
06:06:40.910 --> 06:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
our country's past has created racial
 
06:06:44.390 --> 06:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
disparities in the present as Dr Bennett
 
06:06:46.548 --> 06:06:46.558 align:start position:0%
and Miss Carpenter said as well as many
 
06:06:49.230 --> 06:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
other testified we can see these racial
 
06:06:51.110 --> 06:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
disparities this evidence of the
 
06:06:54.510 --> 06:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
continued existence of systemic racism
 
06:06:56.390 --> 06:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
we see this in the job market and
 
06:06:58.628 --> 06:06:58.638 align:start position:0%
housing education in medicine and in
 
06:06:58.638 --> 06:06:59.510 align:start position:0%
housing education in medicine and in
public

06:06:59.510 --> 06:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
public
 
06:07:01.708 --> 06:07:01.718 align:start position:0%
accommodation I myself am proud to be a
 
06:07:03.150 --> 06:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
member of my school district's racial
 
06:07:05.310 --> 06:07:05.320 align:start position:0%
Equity Advisory Group where we work to
 
06:07:07.910 --> 06:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
combat these disparities in our school
 
06:07:10.350 --> 06:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
system we have made an immense amount of
 
06:07:12.310 --> 06:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
progress and I feel so proud to be part
 
06:07:14.270 --> 06:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
of a community that prioritizes
 
06:07:17.708 --> 06:07:17.718 align:start position:0%
anti-racism HP 544 however would
 
06:07:19.750 --> 06:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
prohibit this group as well as any other
 
06:07:20.750 --> 06:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
discussion within our schools
 
06:07:22.430 --> 06:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
surrounding the reality of our country's
 
06:07:24.990 --> 06:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
past the sponsor of the bill himself
 
06:07:27.750 --> 06:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
said last week that this bill is meant
 
06:07:31.310 --> 06:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
to Target diversity trainers HB 544
 
06:07:33.310 --> 06:07:33.320 align:start position:0%
wants to censor Educators across the
 
06:07:35.788 --> 06:07:35.798 align:start position:0%
state and force them to lie to students
 
06:07:37.708 --> 06:07:37.718 align:start position:0%
to erase the true history of our country
 
06:07:39.590 --> 06:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
in order to make white people feel more
 
06:07:41.708 --> 06:07:41.718 align:start position:0%
comfortable but by doing this we will
 
06:07:43.590 --> 06:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
never be able to address the pervasive
 
06:07:46.190 --> 06:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
racism people of color like me face
 
06:07:50.270 --> 06:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
today thank you and please vote um itl
 
06:07:53.230 --> 06:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:56.270 --> 06:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
544 um representative Schultz you have a
 
06:07:56.280 --> 06:07:57.830 align:start position:0%
544 um representative Schultz you have a
question

loved me
 
06:10:59.590 --> 06:10:59.600 align:start position:0%

family and friends were close to me and
 
06:11:14.708 --> 06:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
so I be honest with you we rais three
 
06:11:18.030 --> 06:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
Rich children mixed race children and uh
 
06:11:21.030 --> 06:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
I lived in America now for total of uh
 
06:11:24.990 --> 06:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
um 88 so 32 years I have never
 
06:11:27.670 --> 06:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
experienced that this discrimination due
 
06:11:31.190 --> 06:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
to my skin color or my race except one
 
06:11:34.150 --> 06:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
incident it was a road rage insult
 
06:11:37.150 --> 06:11:37.160 align:start position:0%
comment and from a lady of course I
 
06:11:41.030 --> 06:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
stood up for myself and she was gone and
 
06:11:44.830 --> 06:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh I'm leaving American Dream today
 
06:11:48.390 --> 06:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
consider my humble past from a totalitar
 
06:11:51.670 --> 06:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
country and I love this country I
 
06:11:55.468 --> 06:11:55.478 align:start position:0%
strongly reject critical race Theory I'm
 
06:11:58.670 --> 06:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
here to support bill because this
 
06:12:01.190 --> 06:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
critical race theory is infecting our
 
06:12:04.150 --> 06:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
country now for years I learned about
 
06:12:07.190 --> 06:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
history of American slavery I also
 
06:12:09.430 --> 06:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
learned history about discrimination
 
06:12:12.070 --> 06:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
against Chinese Americans Japanese
 
06:12:17.390 --> 06:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
Americans and uh I loved Dr King whose
 
06:12:20.190 --> 06:12:20.200 align:start position:0%
famous speech I Have a
 
06:12:23.030 --> 06:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
Dream and since the Civil Rights
 
06:12:27.590 --> 06:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
Movement America has come a long way
 
06:12:31.788 --> 06:12:31.798 align:start position:0%
I remember that so many actually and
 
06:12:35.230 --> 06:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
people of the color today got a elected
 
06:12:37.510 --> 06:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
into government
 
06:12:41.390 --> 06:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
offices and own homes have a businesses
 
06:12:45.190 --> 06:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
and uh I have lots of friends also from
 
06:12:49.590 --> 06:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
all walks of life I do not agree America
 
06:12:53.910 --> 06:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
is a systemic racist country otherwise
 
06:12:56.708 --> 06:12:56.718 align:start position:0%
why would the meons minons Immigrant
 
06:12:59.030 --> 06:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
want to come to this country and have
 
06:13:02.390 --> 06:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
come to this country from all over the
 
06:13:05.948 --> 06:13:05.958 align:start position:0%
world to better their lives they wanted
 
06:13:09.750 --> 06:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
to come here to achieve American Dream
 
06:13:12.468 --> 06:13:12.478 align:start position:0%
critical three theory is based on skin
 
06:13:17.868 --> 06:13:17.878 align:start position:0%
color and race pure and simple it creat
 
06:13:21.430 --> 06:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
hatred it creates division that our
 
06:13:24.990 --> 06:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
country really don't need right now I
 
06:13:27.708 --> 06:13:27.718 align:start position:0%
think it's the tool to be used by the
 
06:13:31.390 --> 06:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
radical left to divide and conquer I
 
06:13:34.750 --> 06:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
grew up during the rain of ma the
 
06:13:37.070 --> 06:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
dictator you should all know right I
 
06:13:40.788 --> 06:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
hope so and uh experience his entire 10
 
06:13:44.628 --> 06:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
years cultural revolution with my own
 
06:13:48.910 --> 06:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
eyes I was a little child let me tell
 
06:13:52.310 --> 06:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
you this racist
 
06:13:55.868 --> 06:13:55.878 align:start position:0%
theory is a technic similar to what
 
06:13:59.670 --> 06:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
happen to US during Mouse regime it
 
06:14:03.070 --> 06:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
separate citizens into two big giant
 
06:14:07.270 --> 06:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
groups victims who are oppressed and and
 
06:14:09.590 --> 06:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
oppressors are the white people
 
06:14:12.070 --> 06:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
especially white males that I happened
 
06:14:15.548 --> 06:14:15.558 align:start position:0%
to married to one and the namei also
 
06:14:19.190 --> 06:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
expressed I was terrified because I
 
06:14:22.590 --> 06:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
remember ma used getting rid of whole
 
06:14:25.548 --> 06:14:25.558 align:start position:0%
like destroy the four old campaign to
 
06:14:29.868 --> 06:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
basically to use the young red guards to
 
06:14:33.628 --> 06:14:33.638 align:start position:0%
achieve absolute power he become a god
 
06:14:35.468 --> 06:14:35.478 align:start position:0%
during the cultural revolution
 
06:14:39.150 --> 06:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
controlled his regime controlled 1.3
 
06:14:42.230 --> 06:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
billion human lives and he divided a
 
06:14:46.590 --> 06:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
citizen into 10 classes five red like me
 
06:14:49.190 --> 06:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
red child from a workers's class and the
 
06:14:52.708 --> 06:14:52.718 align:start position:0%
five blacks you can easily find out what
 
06:14:55.270 --> 06:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
they are I don't want to get into
 
06:14:57.868 --> 06:14:57.878 align:start position:0%
specific those t classes here but he
 
06:15:00.670 --> 06:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
urged the red guards those people who
 
06:15:04.510 --> 06:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
worship Him who were young I leave and
 
06:15:07.590 --> 06:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
who did not know the history to publicly
 
06:15:10.948 --> 06:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
shame and the black classes people have
 
06:15:15.868 --> 06:15:15.878 align:start position:0%
to come out to cutto to basically belong
 
06:15:18.708 --> 06:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
themselves soall their Blackness instead
 
06:15:22.150 --> 06:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
of whiteness and they also beat them up
 
06:15:24.948 --> 06:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
if they don't do criticize
 
06:15:27.270 --> 06:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
correctly when when I saw what happened
 
06:15:29.150 --> 06:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
last summer in our country months and
 
06:15:32.230 --> 06:15:32.240 align:start position:0%

06:15:34.548 --> 06:15:34.558 align:start position:0%
public shaming people if you don't join
 
06:15:37.310 --> 06:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
the New Movement some people might
 
06:15:40.580 --> 06:15:40.590 align:start position:0%
support the black life movement
 
06:15:40.590 --> 06:15:42.190 align:start position:0%

revolution I don't really want that
 
06:16:11.788 --> 06:16:11.798 align:start position:0%
happen to our country because America is
 
06:16:15.270 --> 06:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
a home we have no place to go if we know
 
06:16:17.590 --> 06:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
the American as a free country we can
 
06:16:21.110 --> 06:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
deal with individual cases of racism and
 
06:16:23.750 --> 06:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
the police brutality but we have so much
 
06:16:26.788 --> 06:16:26.798 align:start position:0%
in common as American citizens we love
 
06:16:29.430 --> 06:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
this country we want have the best for
 
06:16:33.670 --> 06:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
our kids and our future so please
 
06:16:38.510 --> 06:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
support this bill and this bill is um
 
06:16:41.430 --> 06:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
going to I think not silence the another
 
06:16:44.190 --> 06:16:44.200 align:start position:0%
side we can still have discussions and
 
06:16:45.948 --> 06:16:45.958 align:start position:0%
and conversations but you don't use
 
06:16:48.510 --> 06:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money to support critical

Clark and
 
06:17:40.430 --> 06:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
um I have been exposed to critical race
 
06:17:44.628 --> 06:17:44.638 align:start position:0%
theory in my family and um I'll tell you
 
06:17:46.510 --> 06:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
about what happened with my
 
06:17:51.670 --> 06:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
son my son um was his name is William
 
06:17:54.510 --> 06:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
Martin Clark his middle name is Martin
 
06:17:56.590 --> 06:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
because he was born on Martin Luther
 
06:18:01.310 --> 06:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
King day of that year and earlier this
 
06:18:05.510 --> 06:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
year he was asked to complete a project
 
06:18:09.270 --> 06:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
in his class where he had to list his I
 
06:18:09.280 --> 06:18:10.510 align:start position:0%
in his class where he had to list his I
his

06:18:10.510 --> 06:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
his
 
06:18:15.990 --> 06:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
identities his uh racial identity his uh
 
06:18:19.190 --> 06:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
his religion his sexual identity all of
 
06:18:22.990 --> 06:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
those things and because he
 
06:18:26.430 --> 06:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
refused he was retaliated against
 
06:18:28.468 --> 06:18:28.478 align:start position:0%
he suffered some
 
06:18:33.510 --> 06:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
serious um emotional distress as have I
 
06:18:36.868 --> 06:18:36.878 align:start position:0%
because he refused to be categorized as
 
06:18:40.750 --> 06:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
an oppressor since he is a straight
 
06:18:40.760 --> 06:18:42.150 align:start position:0%
an oppressor since he is a straight
white

06:18:42.150 --> 06:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
white
 
06:18:45.788 --> 06:18:45.798 align:start position:0%
male since he is a straight white male
 
06:18:49.110 --> 06:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
they have decided for him that he's an
 
06:18:53.468 --> 06:18:53.478 align:start position:0%
oppressor and he is uh privileged when
 
06:18:53.478 --> 06:18:54.468 align:start position:0%
oppressor and he is uh privileged when
this

06:18:54.468 --> 06:18:54.478 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:18:57.270 --> 06:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
boy his father died when he was one
 
06:18:57.280 --> 06:18:58.628 align:start position:0%
boy his father died when he was one
years

06:18:58.628 --> 06:18:58.638 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:19:01.708 --> 06:19:01.718 align:start position:0%
old when this all happened we were
 
06:19:04.070 --> 06:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
living in a motel and William was
 
06:19:06.868 --> 06:19:06.878 align:start position:0%
sleeping on a mat on the floor there's
 
06:19:10.750 --> 06:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
nothing privileged about my son's life
 
06:19:13.110 --> 06:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
and just because he's the straight white
 
06:19:16.948 --> 06:19:16.958 align:start position:0%
male doesn't give anybody the right to
 
06:19:19.510 --> 06:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
make that decision and that distinction
 
06:19:21.990 --> 06:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
and that determination that is what
 
06:19:25.070 --> 06:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
critical race Theory does and if you if
 
06:19:27.750 --> 06:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
you don't root this out right now you
 
06:19:29.788 --> 06:19:29.798 align:start position:0%
will be suffering this same thing in
 
06:19:33.150 --> 06:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
your schools in your jobs and everywhere
 
06:19:36.750 --> 06:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
else it is a poison and you need to get
 
06:19:40.230 --> 06:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
rid of it you can teach Racial equality
 
06:19:42.150 --> 06:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
and you can even you can
 
06:19:45.628 --> 06:19:45.638 align:start position:0%
even decide that racial Equity is is
 
06:19:48.750 --> 06:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
something that you want to uh pursue
 
06:19:51.190 --> 06:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
without critical race Theory as the
 
06:19:53.430 --> 06:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
basis for doing it you want Racial
 
06:19:55.430 --> 06:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
equality you want racial Equity teach
 
06:19:58.948 --> 06:19:58.958 align:start position:0%
the kids math teach the kids English
 
06:20:00.990 --> 06:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
make sure they get good jobs and they
 
06:20:03.948 --> 06:20:03.958 align:start position:0%
have the have the skills to move forward
 
06:20:07.468 --> 06:20:07.478 align:start position:0%
in life you do not need this nonsense it
 
06:20:10.868 --> 06:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
is corrosive it is disgusting you should
 
06:20:13.628 --> 06:20:13.638 align:start position:0%
get rid of it and I am a person of color
 
06:20:15.310 --> 06:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
and I am saying
 
06:20:19.590 --> 06:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
this all my life I have been able to
 
06:20:22.030 --> 06:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
make my own decision and take care of my
 
06:20:25.750 --> 06:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
own self and whenever I needed to I got
 
06:20:29.590 --> 06:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
got help because this is America and if
 
06:20:32.110 --> 06:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
you need help you get help if you're
 
06:20:34.390 --> 06:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
being discriminated against you file a
 
06:20:37.350 --> 06:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
complaint or you file a lawsuit or you
 
06:20:40.070 --> 06:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
do something about you do not need other
 
06:20:42.270 --> 06:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
people to tell you how you should or
 
06:20:44.030 --> 06:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
should not think or what you should or
 
06:20:45.150 --> 06:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
should not
 
06:20:47.910 --> 06:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
do that is what critical race Theory
 
06:20:49.830 --> 06:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
does and it is
 
06:20:52.990 --> 06:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
gross thank you thank you very much Miss
 
06:20:55.270 --> 06:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
Clark appreciate your testimony could
 
06:20:58.070 --> 06:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:58.080 --> 06:21:00.670 align:start position:0%
 
question

06:21:00.670 --> 06:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:21:03.230 --> 06:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
broa thank you madam chair thank you for
 
06:21:05.430 --> 06:21:05.440 align:start position:0%

06:21:18.830 --> 06:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
you you can see all of that information
 
06:21:21.670 --> 06:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
at Schoolhouse rights.org because we
 
06:21:24.628 --> 06:21:24.638 align:start position:0%
filed our lawsuit
 
06:21:24.638 --> 06:21:34.510 align:start position:0%
filed our lawsuit
there

06:21:34.510 --> 06:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:36.150 --> 06:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
mad chair I think the answer to that
 
06:21:38.788 --> 06:21:38.798 align:start position:0%
question is Las Vegas
 
06:21:41.990 --> 06:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
Nevada thank you representative
 
06:21:45.670 --> 06:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
sh uh Jonathan Weinberg
 
06:21:48.948 --> 06:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
please hi uh thank you for this
 
06:21:51.390 --> 06:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity my name is Jonathan Weinberg
 
06:21:53.230 --> 06:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm a recently elected member of the
 
06:21:55.150 --> 06:21:55.160 align:start position:0%
conquered school board however I'm
 
06:21:57.270 --> 06:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
speaking in my capacity as an individual
 
06:21:59.430 --> 06:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
and not on behalf of the board I'm here
 
06:22:01.990 --> 06:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
in strong opposition to the bill if it
 
06:22:05.230 --> 06:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
is truly about protection creating unity
 
06:22:07.230 --> 06:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
and not promoting virence then it would
 
06:22:09.390 --> 06:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
include any mention of gender maybe
 
06:22:11.190 --> 06:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
everyone's saying their pronouns Min are
 
06:22:13.990 --> 06:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
he him his by the way as a blueprint uh
 
06:22:15.910 --> 06:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
furthermore section four if we can look
 
06:22:17.830 --> 06:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
at that under the race or sex
 
06:22:20.390 --> 06:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
scapegoating it plainly ignores science
 
06:22:23.110 --> 06:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
it classifies any claim that consciously
 
06:22:25.310 --> 06:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
or unconsciously and by virtue of his or
 
06:22:28.670 --> 06:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
her race or sex members of any race are
 
06:22:30.868 --> 06:22:30.878 align:start position:0%
inherently racist it labels that as a
 
06:22:34.110 --> 06:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
divisive concept AKA it is attempting to
 
06:22:37.628 --> 06:22:37.638 align:start position:0%
prevent implicit bias training lastly to
 
06:22:39.430 --> 06:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
discuss critical race theory for a
 
06:22:41.750 --> 06:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
second I debated in college and so you
 
06:22:43.390 --> 06:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
need to actually understand the
 
06:22:45.350 --> 06:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
fundamentals of critical race Theory
 
06:22:47.270 --> 06:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
including afro pessimism and afro
 
06:22:49.628 --> 06:22:49.638 align:start position:0%
futurism not just look at a Fox News
 
06:22:51.670 --> 06:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
article or two we need to learn about
 
06:22:53.350 --> 06:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
complete histories and not merely from a
 
06:22:56.150 --> 06:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
single lens perhaps explore Chim Chanda
 
06:22:58.948 --> 06:22:58.958 align:start position:0%
Neo indi's dangers of a single story as
 
06:23:00.910 --> 06:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
well so I'd recommend the committee
 
06:23:02.270 --> 06:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
actually study up on what the
 
06:23:03.910 --> 06:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative proposing this bill is
 
06:23:06.430 --> 06:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
using as their fuel additionally as a
 
06:23:08.590 --> 06:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
previous opponent of this proponent of
 
06:23:10.910 --> 06:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
this bill group these together blatantly
 
06:23:12.510 --> 06:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
racist and
 
06:23:14.990 --> 06:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
anti-American topics so logically if
 
06:23:17.190 --> 06:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
you're racist and anti-American then it
 
06:23:19.270 --> 06:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
is obviously necessary to be anti-racist
 
06:23:21.430 --> 06:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
and American which in itself requires
 
06:23:23.390 --> 06:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
intellectually stimulating conversations
 
06:23:25.868 --> 06:23:25.878 align:start position:0%
with a robust emphasis on how races has
 
06:23:27.230 --> 06:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
manifested throughout the years from the
 
06:23:29.788 --> 06:23:29.798 align:start position:0%
trans Atlantic slave trade to Jim Crow
 
06:23:31.868 --> 06:23:31.878 align:start position:0%
to mass incarceration let's be
 
06:23:33.708 --> 06:23:33.718 align:start position:0%
anti-racist together and astoundingly
 
06:23:35.990 --> 06:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
vote down this Bill thank
 
06:23:39.708 --> 06:23:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:43.150 --> 06:23:43.160 align:start position:0%
much okay uh Leila you have your name
 
06:23:44.868 --> 06:23:44.878 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
06:23:49.910 --> 06:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
up can you hear me yes okay um I just
 
06:23:52.110 --> 06:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
like to say thank you um for having me
 
06:23:54.750 --> 06:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
here I'm just gonna I'm not going to
 
06:23:56.548 --> 06:23:56.558 align:start position:0%
read all of my written testimony I'm
 
06:23:59.110 --> 06:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
just going to skim through it um some of
 
06:24:00.788 --> 06:24:00.798 align:start position:0%
the stuff has already been talked about
 
06:24:02.270 --> 06:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
by other people and they've made a
 
06:24:04.750 --> 06:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
better point of it than I have first off
 
06:24:06.430 --> 06:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
i' just like to say I am a lifelong
 
06:24:08.310 --> 06:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
liberal I am a classical liberal I care
 
06:24:10.750 --> 06:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
about civil rights um but I really don't
 
06:24:12.468 --> 06:24:12.478 align:start position:0%
feel that critical race theory is the
 
06:24:15.750 --> 06:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
best way to solve our problems of racism
 
06:24:17.750 --> 06:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
I think there are better ways um to do
 
06:24:19.910 --> 06:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
it that that don't include programs that
 
06:24:22.750 --> 06:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
are so divisive um so here I will start
 
06:24:25.708 --> 06:24:25.718 align:start position:0%
and read here I am here in support of
 
06:24:28.030 --> 06:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
hp55 my teenage daughter lives in
 
06:24:29.990 --> 06:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
Sandown New Hampshire with her father
 
06:24:32.390 --> 06:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
and step family she is a resident of New
 
06:24:34.070 --> 06:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or she has been a resident of
 
06:24:35.510 --> 06:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and a student of the New
 
06:24:37.310 --> 06:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public schools for about four
 
06:24:40.070 --> 06:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
years um as a parent I am concerned
 
06:24:41.910 --> 06:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
about the possibility of critical race
 
06:24:43.910 --> 06:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
Theory being taught in schools and I'd
 
06:24:46.030 --> 06:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
also like to add um that her father and
 
06:24:47.708 --> 06:24:47.718 align:start position:0%
her stepmother are also in agreement
 
06:24:49.990 --> 06:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
with me um so I am speaking for all of
 
06:24:52.150 --> 06:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
us um he wanted to be here today but he
 
06:24:55.868 --> 06:24:55.878 align:start position:0%
has work and stuff um anyways
 
06:24:58.190 --> 06:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
um for many years critical race Theory
 
06:25:00.510 --> 06:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
made sense to me um sometimes I would
 
06:25:01.830 --> 06:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
even get into arguments with friends
 
06:25:04.270 --> 06:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
about it I I many many years I believed
 
06:25:06.430 --> 06:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
in it um it wasn't until it became more
 
06:25:08.110 --> 06:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
popular and more talked about that I
 
06:25:11.230 --> 06:25:11.240 align:start position:0%
could see how it was divisive and also
 
06:25:13.590 --> 06:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
unscientific um it doesn't allow for any
 
06:25:18.190 --> 06:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
other any other school of thought in um
 
06:25:20.468 --> 06:25:20.478 align:start position:0%
so now I feel that critical race Theory
 
06:25:23.030 --> 06:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
does more harm than good um and in
 
06:25:24.750 --> 06:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
recent years it has become highly
 
06:25:24.760 --> 06:25:26.030 align:start position:0%
recent years it has become highly
controversial

06:25:26.030 --> 06:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
06:25:27.548 --> 06:25:27.558 align:start position:0%
if we bring critical race Theory into
 
06:25:29.628 --> 06:25:29.638 align:start position:0%
our schools and workplaces I feel it
 
06:25:32.110 --> 06:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
will bring on more tensions and div
 
06:25:34.830 --> 06:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
divisions between people I would like to
 
06:25:37.750 --> 06:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
show some examples of how critical race
 
06:25:39.868 --> 06:25:39.878 align:start position:0%
theory has been poorly received in other
 
06:25:42.430 --> 06:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
parts um of the country as reported in
 
06:25:44.990 --> 06:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
three articles I found online in a
 
06:25:46.750 --> 06:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
December 220 article from Christian
 
06:25:48.628 --> 06:25:48.638 align:start position:0%
today entitled Southern Baptist keep
 
06:25:50.948 --> 06:25:50.958 align:start position:0%
quarreling over critical race Theory
 
06:25:52.548 --> 06:25:52.558 align:start position:0%
there is discussion about how some
 
06:25:54.110 --> 06:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
Southern Baptists feel that critical
 
06:25:55.750 --> 06:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
race theory is incomp comptible with
 
06:25:58.190 --> 06:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
their face and disagreements have risen
 
06:26:00.708 --> 06:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
about this in their Community I'll just
 
06:26:02.868 --> 06:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
skip to the end of the quote and say
 
06:26:05.990 --> 06:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
this is this was a quote by Albert Moher
 
06:26:07.510 --> 06:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
president of the Southern Baptist
 
06:26:10.270 --> 06:26:10.280 align:start position:0%
Theological Seminary and he stated we
 
06:26:11.948 --> 06:26:11.958 align:start position:0%
stand together and stating that we
 
06:26:13.708 --> 06:26:13.718 align:start position:0%
believe that advocating critical race
 
06:26:15.868 --> 06:26:15.878 align:start position:0%
Theory or intersectionality is
 
06:26:17.868 --> 06:26:17.878 align:start position:0%
incompatible with the Baptist faith and
 
06:26:20.670 --> 06:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
message and that at that such advocacy
 
06:26:23.510 --> 06:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
has no rightful place within the SBC
 
06:26:25.990 --> 06:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
Seminary I think it speaks loudly to
 
06:26:27.868 --> 06:26:27.878 align:start position:0%
Southern Baptist that we take this stand
 
06:26:30.510 --> 06:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
together end quote now my take on this
 
06:26:33.270 --> 06:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
is that not every church is is going to
 
06:26:35.948 --> 06:26:35.958 align:start position:0%
is going to feel this way um but some of
 
06:26:38.628 --> 06:26:38.638 align:start position:0%
them well and and and and if if churches
 
06:26:40.430 --> 06:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
feel this way and some some religious
 
06:26:41.990 --> 06:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
groups feel this way it's going to cause
 
06:26:43.510 --> 06:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
conflict within those churches and
 
06:26:46.750 --> 06:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
within families um the next article that
 
06:26:48.830 --> 06:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to talk about um to show an
 
06:26:50.788 --> 06:26:50.798 align:start position:0%
example of how it didn't go well in
 
06:26:53.788 --> 06:26:53.798 align:start position:0%
another place is um the an article from
 
06:26:55.788 --> 06:26:55.798 align:start position:0%
the college fixed and
 
06:26:57.868 --> 06:26:57.878 align:start position:0%
activist organized to expel critical
 
06:26:59.910 --> 06:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
race Theory from California's ethnic
 
06:27:01.468 --> 06:27:01.478 align:start position:0%
studies model
 
06:27:03.750 --> 06:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum um the article talks about
 
06:27:05.788 --> 06:27:05.798 align:start position:0%
how various groups um including Jewish
 
06:27:08.510 --> 06:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
groups and Arab Arab groups um spoke out
 
06:27:10.708 --> 06:27:10.718 align:start position:0%
against um the California's ethnic
 
06:27:13.510 --> 06:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
studies model curriculum um and even
 
06:27:15.190 --> 06:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
after they did revisions they were still
 
06:27:17.310 --> 06:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
not happy and
 
06:27:20.948 --> 06:27:20.958 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to quote uh the
 
06:27:22.788 --> 06:27:22.798 align:start position:0%
representative from the alliance for
 
06:27:24.468 --> 06:27:24.478 align:start position:0%
constructive ethnic studies told the
 
06:27:28.590 --> 06:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
college um fix her name is Lisa renson
 
06:27:31.110 --> 06:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
she said that the group was formed in
 
06:27:33.868 --> 06:27:33.878 align:start position:0%
2019 because of concerns the first trp
 
06:27:36.430 --> 06:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
of the curriculum was incredibly
 
06:27:38.430 --> 06:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic and
 
06:27:40.590 --> 06:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
anti-American um later in the same
 
06:27:43.708 --> 06:27:43.718 align:start position:0%
article an educator Lori Myers stated by
 
06:27:45.670 --> 06:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
teaching that people are divided into
 
06:27:47.670 --> 06:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
either oppressors or oppressed groups
 
06:27:49.468 --> 06:27:49.478 align:start position:0%
based solely on their skin color and
 
06:27:51.110 --> 06:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
that white people have all the power and
 
06:27:53.070 --> 06:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
non-white people have none of the power
 
06:27:55.190 --> 06:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
critical race theory is a device of
 
06:27:56.788 --> 06:27:56.798 align:start position:0%
classroom environment that Fosters
 
06:27:59.070 --> 06:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
resentment and Bully bullying between
 
06:28:01.350 --> 06:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
students of different races end
 
06:28:04.430 --> 06:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
quote um the last article I'm just going
 
06:28:05.830 --> 06:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
to skip because it's already been
 
06:28:07.468 --> 06:28:07.478 align:start position:0%
referenced by a few other people that
 
06:28:09.110 --> 06:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
spoke um but it was about that that
 
06:28:10.070 --> 06:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
school in
 
06:28:10.080 --> 06:28:11.670 align:start position:0%
school in
California

06:28:11.670 --> 06:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
California
 
06:28:11.680 --> 06:28:13.350 align:start position:0%
California
um

06:28:13.350 --> 06:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:16.628 --> 06:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
and in closing I would like to say that
 
06:28:18.230 --> 06:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
I have personally seen people lose
 
06:28:22.030 --> 06:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
people um over political disagreements
 
06:28:23.750 --> 06:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
on the past four years I have seen more
 
06:28:25.868 --> 06:28:25.878 align:start position:0%
than a few friendships the dissolve and
 
06:28:28.628 --> 06:28:28.638 align:start position:0%
families divided over politics um one of
 
06:28:30.350 --> 06:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
my friends just moved she just took her
 
06:28:31.948 --> 06:28:31.958 align:start position:0%
newborn baby and moved out of New
 
06:28:33.868 --> 06:28:33.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because she couldn't agree
 
06:28:36.868 --> 06:28:36.878 align:start position:0%
with her family anymore over politics um
 
06:28:38.350 --> 06:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
so it's this is this is something that
 
06:28:40.230 --> 06:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
I've seen personally and this is
 
06:28:42.390 --> 06:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
something that I have never ever seen in
 
06:28:43.990 --> 06:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
my lifetime I have never seen people
 
06:28:47.468 --> 06:28:47.478 align:start position:0%
this divided um critical race Theory um
 
06:28:49.190 --> 06:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
divides people at some point it may end
 
06:28:50.708 --> 06:28:50.718 align:start position:0%
up in my daughter's school or future
 
06:28:52.750 --> 06:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
workplace and I don't want her exposed
 
06:28:54.590 --> 06:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
to things that go against unity and that
 
06:28:56.468 --> 06:28:56.478 align:start position:0%
may put at odds with her classmates
 
06:28:58.788 --> 06:28:58.798 align:start position:0%
friends Andor family and I don't want to
 
06:29:01.070 --> 06:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
see my fellow Americans become more
 
06:29:02.310 --> 06:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
divided by
 
06:29:04.628 --> 06:29:04.638 align:start position:0%
politics um I'm including in my written
 
06:29:07.830 --> 06:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
statement um a few more articles um
 
06:29:10.628 --> 06:29:10.638 align:start position:0%
about about critical race Theory and I I
 
06:29:12.030 --> 06:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
encourage everybody to read these
 
06:29:15.070 --> 06:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
articles and the ones that I quoted and
 
06:29:18.270 --> 06:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
um I just like to say thank you for
 
06:29:21.430 --> 06:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
giving me the opportunity to speak um
 
06:29:23.990 --> 06:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
and you know even if you believe with
 
06:29:27.030 --> 06:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
what critical race the teaches you know
 
06:29:29.390 --> 06:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
I I think it's we can see that it's
 
06:29:31.310 --> 06:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
divisive and and that it's going to
 
06:29:32.948 --> 06:29:32.958 align:start position:0%
cause problems and that I really don't
 
06:29:34.390 --> 06:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
think we're gonna get everybody on the
 
06:29:35.990 --> 06:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
same page with this and I think we
 
06:29:37.788 --> 06:29:37.798 align:start position:0%
should try a different
 
06:29:40.190 --> 06:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
approach you very
 
06:29:43.350 --> 06:29:43.360 align:start position:0%

Banfield

06:29:59.788 --> 06:29:59.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:01.350 --> 06:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon thank you for taking
 
06:30:04.190 --> 06:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
my testimony today honorable members of
 
06:30:06.510 --> 06:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
the executive department departments and
 
06:30:09.110 --> 06:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
administration my name is Amry Banfield
 
06:30:11.390 --> 06:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm an advocate in New Hampshire for
 
06:30:13.830 --> 06:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
academic excellence and education and
 
06:30:16.110 --> 06:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
parental rights I've been advocating for
 
06:30:18.350 --> 06:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
this for the last 15
 
06:30:20.788 --> 06:30:20.798 align:start position:0%
years I worked recently with parents
 
06:30:23.868 --> 06:30:23.878 align:start position:0%
from Hampton and the NAACP on bullying
 
06:30:25.628 --> 06:30:25.638 align:start position:0%
case that involved an African-American
 
06:30:28.628 --> 06:30:28.638 align:start position:0%
girl I'm well aware of the many issues
 
06:30:31.430 --> 06:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
that parents are dealing with right now
 
06:30:33.670 --> 06:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
but like the previous speaker I'm
 
06:30:35.150 --> 06:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
receiving more and more calls from
 
06:30:37.750 --> 06:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
parents and teachers on this critical
 
06:30:40.628 --> 06:30:40.638 align:start position:0%
race Theory many teachers are also
 
06:30:42.430 --> 06:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
concerned about what they would be
 
06:30:45.350 --> 06:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
subjected to in professional development
 
06:30:47.468 --> 06:30:47.478 align:start position:0%
unfortunately many of them feel that
 
06:30:49.788 --> 06:30:49.798 align:start position:0%
they cannot speak publicly because what
 
06:30:51.990 --> 06:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
they believe would unfairly reflect upon
 
06:30:53.750 --> 06:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
them if they do not support it in the
 
06:30:56.270 --> 06:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
school this would impact young children
 
06:30:57.910 --> 06:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
who do not have the ability to make
 
06:31:00.468 --> 06:31:00.478 align:start position:0%
these decisions for themselves Hollis
 
06:31:02.310 --> 06:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
Brookline is one example but there are
 
06:31:05.030 --> 06:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
others so yes this is starting to pick
 
06:31:07.548 --> 06:31:07.558 align:start position:0%
up in New Hampshire in addition one
 
06:31:09.750 --> 06:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
parent of un UNH student sent me a link
 
06:31:13.510 --> 06:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
to critical r.org where UNH lists and it
 
06:31:15.910 --> 06:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
says the University of New Hampshire
 
06:31:17.590 --> 06:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
issued a statement which laid out its
 
06:31:19.830 --> 06:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
black lives matter action plan the
 
06:31:21.788 --> 06:31:21.798 align:start position:0%
university in the plan committed to
 
06:31:25.230 --> 06:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
embedding this study of racism in to the
 
06:31:27.468 --> 06:31:27.478 align:start position:0%
undergraduate curriculum however no
 
06:31:29.468 --> 06:31:29.478 align:start position:0%
specific changes or steps were outlined
 
06:31:32.350 --> 06:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
to accomplish this an updated an update
 
06:31:35.030 --> 06:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
on curriculum changes is expected it is
 
06:31:37.110 --> 06:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
unclear whether this change will include
 
06:31:38.708 --> 06:31:38.718 align:start position:0%
the addition of critical race Theory
 
06:31:41.310 --> 06:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
into its curriculum so UNH is in the
 
06:31:44.750 --> 06:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
processing process of examining that
 
06:31:46.910 --> 06:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
some speakers today have indicated that
 
06:31:49.388 --> 06:31:49.398 align:start position:0%
their personal experiences may not be
 
06:31:51.510 --> 06:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
introduced when it comes to diversity
 
06:31:53.468 --> 06:31:53.478 align:start position:0%
training but I do not see this in the
 
06:31:56.628 --> 06:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
bill the bill um I do not see how it
 
06:31:59.110 --> 06:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
would prohibit thoughtful discussion on
 
06:32:01.468 --> 06:32:01.478 align:start position:0%
Prejudice and racism which we I think
 
06:32:03.788 --> 06:32:03.798 align:start position:0%
everyone believes that this this is an
 
06:32:05.590 --> 06:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
important subject we all need to talk
 
06:32:08.150 --> 06:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
about this and we all need to address it
 
06:32:11.468 --> 06:32:11.478 align:start position:0%
but what parents do not want is a biased
 
06:32:14.388 --> 06:32:14.398 align:start position:0%
Dogma that indoctrinates this children
 
06:32:17.468 --> 06:32:17.478 align:start position:0%
and CRT is what I would consider based
 
06:32:21.548 --> 06:32:21.558 align:start position:0%
on my own observation in my research a
 
06:32:23.788 --> 06:32:23.798 align:start position:0%
dogma and I don't think anybody has
 
06:32:25.150 --> 06:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
brought this up
 
06:32:27.750 --> 06:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
we do currently limit subversive
 
06:32:31.030 --> 06:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
doctrines that is already in current law
 
06:32:35.468 --> 06:32:35.478 align:start position:0%

06:32:37.948 --> 06:32:37.958 align:start position:0%

06:32:44.868 --> 06:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
includes the overthrow by force of the
 
06:32:46.910 --> 06:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
government of the United States or of
 
06:32:48.990 --> 06:32:49.000 align:start position:0%

06:32:52.070 --> 06:32:52.080 align:start position:0%

06:33:04.948 --> 06:33:04.958 align:start position:0%
favor of any particular religious sect
 
06:33:08.750 --> 06:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
or political party so addressing
 
06:33:11.150 --> 06:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
subversive doctrines and biases are
 
06:33:13.030 --> 06:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
already part of new the New Hampshire
 
06:33:17.150 --> 06:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
law to a certain degree I see HB 544
 
06:33:20.430 --> 06:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
expanding on that but I don't see the
 
06:33:23.310 --> 06:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
the the fear that has been um
 
06:33:25.388 --> 06:33:25.398 align:start position:0%
communicated in this hearing Shing it
 
06:33:27.430 --> 06:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
does allow for the important discussions
 
06:33:30.868 --> 06:33:30.878 align:start position:0%
on racism and sexism to continue I do
 
06:33:32.310 --> 06:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
think that this is going to become a
 
06:33:34.830 --> 06:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
bigger issue and I do think parents want
 
06:33:36.788 --> 06:33:36.798 align:start position:0%
good quality instruction in their public
 
06:33:39.788 --> 06:33:39.798 align:start position:0%
schools because this does not prohibit
 
06:33:42.230 --> 06:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
quality instruction on diversity
 
06:33:44.708 --> 06:33:44.718 align:start position:0%
inclusion or the views of even Martin
 
06:33:48.590 --> 06:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
Luther King Jr I would support HB 544
 
06:33:50.628 --> 06:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
you've been given examples today from
 
06:33:52.830 --> 06:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
parents in New Hampshire there's enough
 
06:33:55.030 --> 06:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
evidence that warrants this kind of
 
06:33:57.830 --> 06:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
that supports equality for all so I
 
06:33:59.628 --> 06:33:59.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and I thank you
 
06:34:01.910 --> 06:34:01.920 align:start position:0%

apologize I do not have time to take
 
06:34:06.350 --> 06:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
questions so um I will have to to leave
 
06:34:09.190 --> 06:34:09.200 align:start position:0%

[Music]

06:34:39.910 --> 06:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:44.230 --> 06:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
Cen hi can you hear me problem conned
 
06:34:47.350 --> 06:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
when I was promoted to panelist um good
 
06:34:49.230 --> 06:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee thank
 
06:34:51.070 --> 06:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
you so much for letting me speak today
 
06:34:53.070 --> 06:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't sign up I wasn't
 
06:34:56.590 --> 06:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
planning on testifying today um but I um
 
06:34:59.310 --> 06:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
I come here representing myself I am a
 
06:35:01.070 --> 06:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
member of the group granted State
 
06:35:03.510 --> 06:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
progress and a lot of the work we do is
 
06:35:07.468 --> 06:35:07.478 align:start position:0%
tracking bills like these that um impose
 
06:35:11.868 --> 06:35:11.878 align:start position:0%
strict limits on free speech um in the
 
06:35:13.628 --> 06:35:13.638 align:start position:0%
process of live tweeting this Committee
 
06:35:16.150 --> 06:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
hearing other Witnesses sent hordes of
 
06:35:18.030 --> 06:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
white supremacist trolls against me and
 
06:35:19.230 --> 06:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
I know that there's going to be a point
 
06:35:20.670 --> 06:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
of order called about speaking about
 
06:35:22.628 --> 06:35:22.638 align:start position:0%
other Witnesses so I'm going to say I'm
 
06:35:24.990 --> 06:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
not going to bring that up any further
 
06:35:27.670 --> 06:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
this is just to illustrate the fact that
 
06:35:30.750 --> 06:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
this anti-racism training is critical to
 
06:35:33.150 --> 06:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
keeping our neighbors safe here in New
 
06:35:35.430 --> 06:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have been attacked by over
 
06:35:37.990 --> 06:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
300 different people today sending me
 
06:35:41.230 --> 06:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
death threats calling me a Jewish hag um
 
06:35:43.270 --> 06:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
and telling me that my speaking out
 
06:35:45.590 --> 06:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
about anti-racism and speaking out about
 
06:35:47.990 --> 06:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
white supremacy um is a good reason why
 
06:35:50.990 --> 06:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
I should be censured um so for those who
 
06:35:53.110 --> 06:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
are saying that critical race Theory and
 
06:35:55.510 --> 06:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
anti-racism training are divisive
 
06:35:58.468 --> 06:35:58.478 align:start position:0%
ignoring white supremacy is divisive it
 
06:36:01.110 --> 06:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
leaves our neighbors vulnerable we elect
 
06:36:03.510 --> 06:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
you to do everything in your power to
 
06:36:05.430 --> 06:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
protect the most vulnerable people of
 
06:36:07.190 --> 06:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
this state and ensure that we all have
 
06:36:10.190 --> 06:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
access to high quality of life liberty
 
06:36:12.070 --> 06:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
and the pursuit of happiness and
 
06:36:14.910 --> 06:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
instituting this law would actively
 
06:36:16.750 --> 06:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
prevent our neighbors prevent the most
 
06:36:18.350 --> 06:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
vulnerable in our community from being
 
06:36:20.548 --> 06:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
safe and being protected in institutions
 
06:36:22.270 --> 06:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
of Higher Learning and other
 
06:36:24.548 --> 06:36:24.558 align:start position:0%
state-funded public entities so I
 
06:36:27.110 --> 06:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
encourage you to itl this bill think of
 
06:36:29.628 --> 06:36:29.638 align:start position:0%
your neighbors who are still being
 
06:36:31.788 --> 06:36:31.798 align:start position:0%
threatened every single day by White
 
06:36:33.548 --> 06:36:33.558 align:start position:0%
supremacists and the fact that it is
 
06:36:37.070 --> 06:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon all of us not just to not
 
06:36:40.150 --> 06:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
be racist but to be actively seeking and
 
06:36:41.868 --> 06:36:41.878 align:start position:0%
working towards a better world in which
 
06:36:44.910 --> 06:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
we have fully eradicated racism thank
 
06:36:46.590 --> 06:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
you so much for your time and I hope
 
06:36:48.628 --> 06:36:48.638 align:start position:0%
that you'll look deep into your hearts
 
06:36:50.388 --> 06:36:50.398 align:start position:0%
and find it within yourselves to itl
 
06:36:53.230 --> 06:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm happy to take questions
 
06:36:55.030 --> 06:36:55.040 align:start position:0%

06:37:32.150 --> 06:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
hello thank you madam
 
06:37:35.070 --> 06:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
chair I would just like to start out on
 
06:37:36.990 --> 06:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
addressing an earlier comment on the
 
06:37:39.350 --> 06:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
denial of systemic racism in New
 
06:37:41.350 --> 06:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think that comment was
 
06:37:44.110 --> 06:37:44.120 align:start position:0%
referring to on June 9th 2020 where
 
06:37:46.310 --> 06:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
Governor Shu stated said comment that it
 
06:37:47.388 --> 06:37:47.398 align:start position:0%
does not
 
06:37:50.548 --> 06:37:50.558 align:start position:0%
exist as for the personal experience of
 
06:37:51.708 --> 06:37:51.718 align:start position:0%
my life in New
 
06:37:54.190 --> 06:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I had switch School District
 
06:37:57.388 --> 06:37:57.398 align:start position:0%
from brid school at the age of six on
 
06:37:59.628 --> 06:37:59.638 align:start position:0%
Martin Luther King day because on a bus
 
06:38:01.548 --> 06:38:01.558 align:start position:0%
drive a student had a book that he came
 
06:38:04.510 --> 06:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
from the library and I was talking about
 
06:38:07.070 --> 06:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
 home to my parents and had to
 
06:38:09.430 --> 06:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
bring that up can't hear you very well
 
06:38:11.388 --> 06:38:11.398 align:start position:0%
could you speak more clearly we're
 
06:38:14.070 --> 06:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
having a lot of trouble
 
06:38:18.388 --> 06:38:18.398 align:start position:0%
understanding is this better Madam chair
 
06:38:21.350 --> 06:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
yes all right I'll restart that last
 
06:38:23.868 --> 06:38:23.878 align:start position:0%
part at the age of six I had to leave
 
06:38:26.430 --> 06:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
rich water Hein school because on Martin
 
06:38:28.230 --> 06:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
Luther King day I was on a bus ride to
 
06:38:30.030 --> 06:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
my grandmother's and a student had a
 
06:38:31.548 --> 06:38:31.558 align:start position:0%
book talking about winching and
 
06:38:33.830 --> 06:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
wanted AG go pretty much had to switch
 
06:38:35.468 --> 06:38:35.478 align:start position:0%
schools because I went to my parents ask
 
06:38:37.350 --> 06:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
them what that is after years of trying
 
06:38:40.388 --> 06:38:40.398 align:start position:0%
to be hidden from racism I experienced
 
06:38:42.310 --> 06:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
it through much of my school in my
 
06:38:44.590 --> 06:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
freshman year I remember my guidance
 
06:38:47.670 --> 06:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
counselor speaking about my Academia
 
06:38:49.230 --> 06:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
telling my mother that it must be hard
 
06:38:51.830 --> 06:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
to be a single mother racing a black
 
06:38:54.548 --> 06:38:54.558 align:start position:0%
child um I
 
06:38:56.388 --> 06:38:56.398 align:start position:0%
over the summer since starting
 
06:38:58.628 --> 06:38:58.638 align:start position:0%
protesting have received significant
 
06:39:00.628 --> 06:39:00.638 align:start position:0%
death threats one of them went viral in
 
06:39:04.270 --> 06:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
many conservative social media Post in
 
06:39:06.590 --> 06:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
over the news in PL New
 
06:39:10.110 --> 06:39:10.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I think that if we are
 
06:39:11.948 --> 06:39:11.958 align:start position:0%
going to have a productive conversation
 
06:39:14.708 --> 06:39:14.718 align:start position:0%
regarding race that we have to lean into
 
06:39:17.830 --> 06:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
it we have to allow the proper discourse
 
06:39:19.628 --> 06:39:19.638 align:start position:0%
and in line B when it says inherently
 
06:39:21.628 --> 06:39:21.638 align:start position:0%
that these things are not there I think
 
06:39:23.590 --> 06:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
that many of the testimonies today and
 
06:39:25.030 --> 06:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
much of the media coverage from
 
06:39:26.430 --> 06:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
activists all over the state telling
 
06:39:26.440 --> 06:39:27.388 align:start position:0%
activists all over the state telling
their

06:39:27.388 --> 06:39:27.398 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:39:31.310 --> 06:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
stories that is very very evident that
 
06:39:34.948 --> 06:39:34.958 align:start position:0%
it exists regardless of
 
06:39:37.548 --> 06:39:37.558 align:start position:0%
disposition that is my end of my um
 
06:39:42.190 --> 06:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:47.548 --> 06:39:47.558 align:start position:0%

come into this meeting a little late
 
06:40:42.350 --> 06:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
um I a couple of things that I I've been
 
06:40:44.548 --> 06:40:44.558 align:start position:0%
noticed that I that I've that I've heard
 
06:40:48.350 --> 06:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
was one side feeling completely
 
06:40:52.110 --> 06:40:52.120 align:start position:0%
oppressed and another side feeling
 
06:40:56.150 --> 06:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
scared that they weren't going to be um
 
06:40:58.230 --> 06:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
taken seriously or that their rights
 
06:41:00.468 --> 06:41:00.478 align:start position:0%
were infringed on but I can't help but
 
06:41:02.150 --> 06:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
notice the people that are feeling
 
06:41:04.750 --> 06:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
scared scared for their lives scared for
 
06:41:04.760 --> 06:41:05.548 align:start position:0%
scared scared for their lives scared for
their

06:41:05.548 --> 06:41:05.558 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:41:08.910 --> 06:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
children we just we just um listened to
 
06:41:12.190 --> 06:41:12.200 align:start position:0%
three days of hearings on
 
06:41:16.548 --> 06:41:16.558 align:start position:0%
hb20 um and in in those hearings people
 
06:41:20.430 --> 06:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
were saying that their children who are
 
06:41:25.350 --> 06:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
LGBT um black um specific ific Islander
 
06:41:28.110 --> 06:41:28.120 align:start position:0%
um transgendered would not be accepted

to go into a Catholic
 
06:41:34.030 --> 06:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
institution um because they'd be
 
06:41:38.110 --> 06:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
discriminated um why are we not
 
06:41:41.590 --> 06:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
teaching anti- discrimination in public
 
06:41:45.628 --> 06:41:45.638 align:start position:0%
schools so these children do not have to
 
06:41:49.310 --> 06:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
seek School elsewhere to seek shelter
 
06:41:52.910 --> 06:41:52.920 align:start position:0%

be able to make it to this uh hearing I
 
06:42:41.910 --> 06:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
am uh a registered lobbyist in the state
 
06:42:44.910 --> 06:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I work for a nonprofit
 
06:42:47.468 --> 06:42:47.478 align:start position:0%
called rights and
 
06:42:50.230 --> 06:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
democracy and um but i' I'd really like
 
06:42:54.430 --> 06:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
to just uh take a second to share with
 
06:42:56.910 --> 06:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
all of you uh some of my experience
 
06:42:59.510 --> 06:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
before uh I became
 
06:43:02.190 --> 06:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
employed uh by this nonprofit in the
 
06:43:04.830 --> 06:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh for five years
 
06:43:08.190 --> 06:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
before that I served as in my community
 
06:43:10.548 --> 06:43:10.558 align:start position:0%
as a substitute
 
06:43:14.310 --> 06:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
teacher and on numerous occasions uh I
 
06:43:17.990 --> 06:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
was confronted with situations where
 
06:43:21.150 --> 06:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
children were uh bullying each other
 
06:43:23.510 --> 06:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
because of their race or where they came
 
06:43:23.520 --> 06:43:24.310 align:start position:0%
because of their race or where they came
from

06:43:24.310 --> 06:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:43:27.468 --> 06:43:27.478 align:start position:0%
from I often struggled with how to deal
 
06:43:30.388 --> 06:43:30.398 align:start position:0%
with this in the classroom because there
 
06:43:34.430 --> 06:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
was no program for me to follow and I
 
06:43:36.990 --> 06:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
often felt that I might not be supported
 
06:43:39.310 --> 06:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
by my Administration or even fellow
 
06:43:43.670 --> 06:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
teachers because there was a lack of
 
06:43:46.910 --> 06:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines I oppose
 
06:43:50.510 --> 06:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
544 immensely it is not the direction we
 
06:43:52.628 --> 06:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
should be going we should be walking
 
06:43:54.548 --> 06:43:54.558 align:start position:0%
into our fear of having these
 
06:43:58.110 --> 06:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
conversations with each other and uh
 
06:43:59.948 --> 06:43:59.958 align:start position:0%
that will that will actually get us
 
06:44:02.030 --> 06:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
through this critical race Theory I have
 
06:44:05.750 --> 06:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
read a ton about and um I would I would
 
06:44:08.310 --> 06:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee and all of the
 
06:44:11.150 --> 06:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
people here today to do more research
 
06:44:14.190 --> 06:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
and not from a biased position on what
 
06:44:17.948 --> 06:44:17.958 align:start position:0%
critical race theory is and it is not it
 
06:44:21.788 --> 06:44:21.798 align:start position:0%
is not a political ideology in fact I
 
06:44:24.708 --> 06:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
disagree PE with people who believe in
 
06:44:27.590 --> 06:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
critical race Theory all the time there
 
06:44:32.150 --> 06:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
is a vast and immense amount of folks uh
 
06:44:35.628 --> 06:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
with different opinions but they do
 
06:44:39.868 --> 06:44:39.878 align:start position:0%
agree that we have a really a problem
 
06:44:41.788 --> 06:44:41.798 align:start position:0%
with race in this country that really
 
06:44:43.868 --> 06:44:43.878 align:start position:0%
needs to be dealt with head-on so I
 
06:44:46.590 --> 06:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
encourage us uh all to work on this
 
06:44:50.270 --> 06:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
together and to oppose this bill and uh
 
06:44:51.910 --> 06:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't have any place in the
 
06:44:54.070 --> 06:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire thank so much for
 
06:44:56.910 --> 06:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
