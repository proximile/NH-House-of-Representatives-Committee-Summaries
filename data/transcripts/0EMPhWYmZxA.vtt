and a protocol subcommittee that I
 
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
appointed a year and a half ago so look
 
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
at various possible pieces of
 
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.270 align:start position:0%
at various possible pieces of

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 align:start position:0%

title of our committee
 
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
the title of the committee isn't exists
 
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
now referred to medical conditions not
 
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
to people
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
other titles were suggested
 
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
I've asked a few members of this
 
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to do an informal poll in
 
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
the deaf and hard of hearing community
 
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to see what their
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
pleasure would be
 
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
and I asked a few other members of the
 
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to investigate to see what
 
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
other states call similar commissions to
 
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.430 align:start position:0%
other states call similar commissions to
ours

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
ours
 
00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming choice for the rename
 
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
was the New Hampshire commission for the
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
death and
 
00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:05.710 align:start position:0%
death and
positive

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
positive
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
proactive title that speaks about people
 
00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
along the way this group wondered if we
 
00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
could form a commission or committee out
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
of a bill
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
to investigate how the services for the
 
00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:24.419 align:start position:0%
deaf and hard of hearing are being
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
conducted in our long-term care
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
facilities in the state
 
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
after much discussion and consultation
 
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
with those who have been in the house a
 
00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:39.139 align:start position:0%
lot longer than me the conclusion was
 
00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:42.419 align:start position:0%
instead of having something set
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
let us invite
 
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:47.660 align:start position:0%
representatives of the three major
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
long-term care facility organizations to
 
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
join the commission
 
00:08:00.249 --> 00:08:00.259 align:start position:0%
I suppose with the person who leads the
 
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
County nursing homes the person who
 
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
leads the private nursing homes and the
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
person who leads the extended care
 
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
facilities that are not so much interest
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
each person thought it was a good idea
 
00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:20.099 align:start position:0%
to have a representative become part of
 
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
the commission to bring that perspective
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
to the various things under
 
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
consideration and especially on those
 
00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:31.979 align:start position:0%
times when we were looking at the
 
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
extended care facilities and the
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
services they provide
 
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
each face it was apparent to me
 
00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
something that I've experienced in a
 
00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:44.099 align:start position:0%
lifetime of visiting people in the
 
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
nursing homes that most nursing home
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
administrators really care and are
 
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do a good job that they're
 
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
willing to learn things that they didn't
 
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
know before in terms of caring for their
 
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.690 align:start position:0%
know before in terms of caring for their
people

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
so this good old seems to rename the
 
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:05.700 align:start position:0%
commission and add three members and I
 
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
just delineated
 
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
that is my testimony in acting chair
 
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Pearson
 
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
before I take questions I will recognize
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
representative snow to tell us where he
 
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
is and whether he's alone so that we're
 
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
again you just muted yourself you were
 
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:36.080 align:start position:0%

had told us that you were going to be
 
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.949 align:start position:0%
had told us that you were going to be
delayed

00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
delayed
 
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
but with that I'll ask if there are any
 
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:07.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll thank representative
 
00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:12.620 align:start position:0%
Pearson for his testimony and recognize
 
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
yes we can
 
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak I
 
00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
apologize for getting my testimony
 
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
request in at the very last minute
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
um I just saw that this was having a
 
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
hearing this morning
 
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
um and it's a very important bill
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
um my name is Jules good
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
um I do work for Northeast deaf and hard
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
of hearing services but I'm here
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
representing myself as a private citizen
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
I am deaf I live in Concord New
 
00:10:49.079 --> 00:10:50.389 align:start position:0%
I am deaf I live in Concord New
Hampshire

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:53.579 align:start position:0%
um first of all I would love to just
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
voice my support for the renaming of the
 
00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
commission I think it's super great that
 
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
you're centering people like me instead
 
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:01.740 align:start position:0%
of medical conditions so I really
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
um in my role I also do work with a lot
 
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
of Nursing and extended care facilities
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
so I also appreciate that you're adding
 
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
their perspectives as a part of the
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
committee one thing that I would like to
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
recommend as a suggestion for an
 
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
addition to the bill would be to add a
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
member of the public who has lived
 
00:11:27.769 --> 00:11:27.779 align:start position:0%
experience as a deafblind person so the
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
deaf-blind community is definitely a
 
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
part of the deaf and hard of hearing
 
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
Community even though they kind of
 
00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:35.459 align:start position:0%
bridge you know between the deaf and
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
blind communities they're still very
 
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
much a part of the work that we do and
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
um and need to be represented in
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
committees such as this you may notice
 
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
um in HB 631 which you'll be hearing
 
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:51.620 align:start position:0%
later this week that bill is relative to
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
standards for interpreters for the deaf
 
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
and hard of hearing they are adding into
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
that bill language to talk about
 
00:11:59.810 --> 00:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
interpreters for deaf-blind people as
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
well so I think it's only appropriate
 
00:12:04.449 --> 00:12:04.459 align:start position:0%
that we include
 
00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:08.579 align:start position:0%
deaf-blind citizens in our in the
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
language for this bill as well being
 
00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:11.459 align:start position:0%
that they're being
 
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
discussed so close together
 
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
um so I am happy to take any questions
 
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
you have about this I am using the
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
captioning service which I'm so happy is
 
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
being provided that's so great
 
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
um so it may just take a minute for it
 
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:25.740 align:start position:0%
to catch up with what you're saying
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%

towards the motion
 
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:22.380 align:start position:0%

amendment we're not making any changes
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
to the bill we are taking under
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
advisement for us to eventually uh bring
 
00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:43.639 align:start position:0%

yeah the the motion on the floor is
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
ought to pass if you wish to have an
 
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
amendment you would vote in the negative
 
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
and uh then bring an amendment forward
 
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
and that would certainly be one result
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
that could be possible from this is
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%

bills crimes funds the representative

uh thank you Mr chairman uh good morning

William Marsh representing seven towns
 
00:18:42.409 --> 00:18:42.419 align:start position:0%
in southern Carroll County relevant to
 
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
this bill I also chair the New Hampshire
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
rare disease advisory Council I'm
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
pleased today to offer for your
 
00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
consideration how still 600 relative to
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
funding newborn screening tests which I
 
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
found at the request of the New
 
00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's newborn screening
 
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
program is a wonderful program and the
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is not to change the
 
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
program in any way for instance in the
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
last year one of my ballot clerks in the
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
town of Brookfield had their first Grand
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
shop the child was diagnosed with spinal
 
00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:15.299 align:start position:0%
muscular atrophy a test newly added to
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
our newborn screening panel and
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
successfully treated with genetic
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
therapy this baby now looks forward to a
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
normal life without treatment SMA is
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
universally fatal
 
00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:27.299 align:start position:0%
the issue that I have with the program
 
00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:30.419 align:start position:0%
is how they send out their bills
 
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
under current law DHHS builds hospitals
 
00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
for the filter paper on which blood
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
samples are submitted for testing
 
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
the cost of this filter paper has
 
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
doubled in the last year and I
 
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
understand it is now approximately 210
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
dollars per piece of paper
 
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
it is expected to increase as more tests
 
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
are added to the newborn screening panel
 
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
which is reasonable and expected as more
 
00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:57.799 align:start position:0%
genetic diseases are
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
they develop treatments for these
 
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.669 align:start position:0%
they develop treatments for these
diseases

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
filter paper is the supply and this and
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
and a bill for filter paper cannot be
 
00:20:09.049 --> 00:20:09.059 align:start position:0%
submitted to insurers there is no charge
 
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
at this point in time for the test
 
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.590 align:start position:0%
at this point in time for the test
performed

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
performed
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
we are simply asking the commissioner to
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
restructure the current fee so that
 
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
these bills can be submitted to
 
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.630 align:start position:0%
these bills can be submitted to
insurance

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
instead of billing for filter paper the
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
invoice could read newborn screening
 
00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:27.529 align:start position:0%
invoice could read newborn screening
panel

00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:27.539 align:start position:0%
panel
 
00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:30.539 align:start position:0%
this is already done in other states for
 
00:20:33.289 --> 00:20:33.299 align:start position:0%
instance in the state of Texas effective
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2001 that being 20 years ago
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
HC PCS code s3620 was implemented for
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
newborn metabolic screenings
 
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
Minnesota uses the same billing code you
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
can see this on their websites
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
an American Academy of Pediatrics
 
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.020 align:start position:0%

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
newborn screening if not already
 
00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
performed and the list of CPT codes most
 
00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:04.990 align:start position:0%

coverage for Pediatric preventative
 
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
Services has been mandated by federal
 
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
law without co-payer deductible since
 
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
2014 pursuant to 45 CFR
 
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
147.130 this bill does not mandate any
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
regarding a proposed amendment to add
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
the words collection fees that does not
 
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
work for a great many reasons the major
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
one being that the federal law just
 
00:21:42.409 --> 00:21:42.419 align:start position:0%
sledded mandates coverage for
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
preventative health services and says
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
nothing about collection fees
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill will help maintain
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
the economic viability of the various
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
birthing centers in New Hampshire
 
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
because we will allow them to recover at
 
00:21:57.289 --> 00:21:57.299 align:start position:0%
least some of their costs thank you and
 
00:22:09.409 --> 00:22:09.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:14.169 --> 00:22:14.179 align:start position:0%
I believe we have lost the chair
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
's right here
 
00:22:17.159 --> 00:22:19.549 align:start position:0%
's right here
good

00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:21.299 align:start position:0%
I'm just giving people the chance to
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%

thank representative Marsh for
 
00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this important bill as along
 
00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
with the rest of the co-sponsors
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
um I have to say
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
um some representative Marsh did such an
 
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
excellent job at explaining this I
 
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
really don't have much more to say
 
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.049 align:start position:0%
really don't have much more to say
except

00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:21.059 align:start position:0%
except
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
um everything that he said um that was
 
00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:27.059 align:start position:0%
um really well presented um this is a
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
very important bill to our hospitals we
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
as representative Marsh said we are not
 
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
looking to change the program at all we
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
are looking to just essentially ensure
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
that the state law is aligned with the
 
00:23:42.529 --> 00:23:42.539 align:start position:0%
federal law and allow for the hospitals
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
and birthing the birthing hospitals and
 
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
birthing centers not every hospital as
 
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
you know provides birthing
 
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
um Services unfortunately but have the
 
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
birthing centers and birthing hospitals
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
be able to bill for these screening
 
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
tests and get reimbursed and not
 
00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
dictating what they'll get reimbursed
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
again just allowing for that opportunity
 
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
um and as he indicated currently the way
 
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
the program is structured essentially
 
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
the hospitals and birthing centers
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
pay for the filter paper which
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
effectively pays for the program
 
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
um again we're just trying to allow that
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to have them be able to
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
build we do believe it's a very
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
important bill
 
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
um to balance the fees needed to support
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
the program with the ability to recoup
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
some costs and we asked the committee to
 
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass happy to answer any
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%

proposed legislation
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
so just to give you the background
 
00:26:00.769 --> 00:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
um uh the the current legislation
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
amongst the existing law to make clear
 
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
where the fees are charged for the
 
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
hospitals and newborn screening I'm I
 
00:26:09.289 --> 00:26:09.299 align:start position:0%
just want to thank the committee for
 
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
giving me this opportunity just to
 
00:26:12.649 --> 00:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
provide an overview of what's the
 
00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:15.299 align:start position:0%
function and funding of current uh our
 
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
program for the New Hampshire of newborn
 
00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:18.539 align:start position:0%
screening program
 
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
so newborn screening program has
 
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:22.740 align:start position:0%
represented Amash mentioned is an
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
essential preventive public health
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
program it's a population health program
 
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
population based program it's a complex
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
integrated system so what we are trying
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
to do is to get an early identification
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
of some of these metabolic disorders
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
genetic disorders so that way we can
 
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
timely and have a timely as well as an
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
early intervention and that actually can
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
lead to elimination or reduction of
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
death and disability so for every new
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
every time we see what we do is when we
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
see an abnormal screening we actually
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
link the infant to there subsequently to
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
receive any kind of diagnostic test as
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
well as refer them for the appropriate
 
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.830 align:start position:0%
well as refer them for the appropriate
treatment

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
so how what we do in New Hampshire New
 
00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh newborn screening program
 
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
is approximately we have around 12 000
 
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
births every year so we are responsible
 
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
for assuring that all the new in all the
 
00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
infants who are born in New Hampshire
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
are screened at Birth for inherited any
 
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
of these inherited medical disorders so
 
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
what we do is we take few drops not we
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
in a sense in the hospital they take few
 
00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
drops of blood
 
00:27:33.169 --> 00:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
and um actually uh a few drops of blood
 
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
are taken from infants heal at uh 24 to
 
00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299 align:start position:0%
72 hours of birth on a filter paper and
 
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
that's actually sent to a lab for
 
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
testing and this process is done before
 
00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
the infant leaves a hospital or the
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
birthing center because time is timing
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
is everything for in this in this
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
situation because some conditions need
 
00:27:54.049 --> 00:27:54.059 align:start position:0%
to be identified within the first week
 
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
of life and this all happens under our
 
00:27:59.630 --> 00:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
state legislation families May refuse
 
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
the screening if they wish to and we are
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for handling all the
 
00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:06.539 align:start position:0%
screening results follow up on the out
 
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
of range results as needed like
 
00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
following up with the pediatrician to
 
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
let them know about the condition as
 
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
well as following providing those
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
resources to the families and to the
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
pediatrician so what we do in New
 
00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:22.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is we screen for 37 conditions
 
00:28:24.529 --> 00:28:24.539 align:start position:0%
not only these we also screen for
 
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
critical congenital heart defects as
 
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
well as newborn screening so we have an
 
00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
advisory committee under the legislation
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
that actually provides recommendations
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
to our state program on what kind of
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
clinical educational or operational
 
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
aspects of the program is and this
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
committee actually meets biannually we
 
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
also have provide an annual report
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
that's required under the legislation to
 
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services oversight
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
committee on previous years uh newborn
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
screening program activities
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
come into the funding how this is
 
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
actually funded newborn screening
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
program in New Hampshire does not use
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
any state or federal funds rather it is
 
00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
a non-lapsing newborn screening
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
revolving fund it's funded by filter
 
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
papers currently the cost of filter
 
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
papers is 146 dollars not two hundred
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
dollars but 100 146 and it's paid by the
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
participating Health Care Providers
 
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
these include our hospitals birthing
 
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.750 align:start position:0%
these include our hospitals birthing
centers

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
centers
 
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
so and basically the filter paper is
 
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
used for blood spot testing so we have
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
around 17 hospitals that are are part of
 
00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
this group we um the current cost
 
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
operational cost annual operational cost
 
00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
for the newborn screening program is 1.8
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
million and the funds are used to pay
 
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
for the cost related with a contract
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
that we have with University of
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Medical School which runs
 
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
our newborn screening or the art lab
 
00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
program so they are responsible for a
 
00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:54.539 align:start position:0%
testing screening and shipping and
 
00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:58.140 align:start position:0%
supplies the fund also supports a 1.5
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
FTE Personnel for the program a database
 
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
system as well as a medical consultant
 
00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
so our understanding with our current
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
legislation is it will not impact the
 
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
process by which how the the program is
 
00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
funded but more clarity on on um and
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
also that fees how the fees are
 
00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
collected but also important thing is
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
that this will not have a direct
 
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
physical impact on the newborn screening
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
program so thank you for giving me this
 
00:30:27.889 --> 00:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk about newborn
 
00:30:30.409 --> 00:30:30.419 align:start position:0%
screening program in New Hampshire and
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh please let me know if you have any
 
00:30:32.159 --> 00:30:35.210 align:start position:0%
uh please let me know if you have any
questions

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr Cheryl are there any
 
00:30:39.889 --> 00:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee or the one
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none I thank you for your
 
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
testimony and the chair recognizes
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
Heidi roll who is a lobbyist North
 
00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:03.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Mr chairman are you able
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
to hear me yes thank you
 
00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you very much um yes
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning everyone my name
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
is Heidi Kroll
 
00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
um I work at Gallagher Callahan and
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
gartrell and I represent America's
 
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
health insurance plans otherwise known
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
as ahip
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
um which is the um trade Association for
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
the health insurance carriers
 
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
um and I think there will be a few other
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
carriers who testify here today as well
 
00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:32.990 align:start position:0%
carriers who testify here today as well
um

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
we're just kind of scratching our heads
 
00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
on this one I guess
 
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
um confused and I think looking for some
 
00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.110 align:start position:0%
um confused and I think looking for some
clarification

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
um our understanding is that the
 
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
carriers do reimburse
 
00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
um for a bundle of newborn screening
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
tests reimburse the the hospitals or the
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
birthing centers for that
 
00:31:58.730 --> 00:31:58.740 align:start position:0%
um uh to the best of my knowledge um
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
talking with some of the New Hampshire a
 
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.570 align:start position:0%
talking with some of the New Hampshire a
members

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:04.860 align:start position:0%
um none of the hospitals or birthing
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
centers approach the carriers
 
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
um to indicate that
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
um the reimbursement for those bundle of
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
services was
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
um in their opinion not adequate to
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of the filter paper
 
00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:22.850 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of the filter paper
um

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
and so I guess we're we're just a little
 
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
um concerned that perhaps we're having a
 
00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
um rather than kind of going through the
 
00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.310 align:start position:0%
um rather than kind of going through the
normal

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
normal
 
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
um Contracting process and procedures
 
00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:38.389 align:start position:0%
um Contracting process and procedures
that

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
um hospitals and carriers engage in
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
um that we're looking for a legislative
 
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
um solution or intervention so
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
um I I may be misunderstanding the
 
00:32:50.039 --> 00:32:51.470 align:start position:0%
um I I may be misunderstanding the
situation

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
um and uh but that's that's our concern
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
I guess is that we're looking for a
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
legislative solution when maybe there
 
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
could have been one outside of of the
 
00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.289 align:start position:0%
could have been one outside of of the
legislature

00:33:03.289 --> 00:33:03.299 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
um we're just simply working in the
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
normal Contracting that happens between
 
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
if he would address that
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh yes I'll be glad to address that
 
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
although I think Paula minahan would be
 
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
a better person to address that it is my
 
00:33:27.529 --> 00:33:27.539 align:start position:0%
understanding that insurers are not uh
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursing for the filter paper because
 
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
they're not being sent any bills for the
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
filter paper so uh I will yield my time
 
00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:37.019 align:start position:0%
to Parliament
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman this is this is Heidi Kroll
 
00:33:54.169 --> 00:33:54.179 align:start position:0%
again um I guess I would just say that I
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
you know I think the concern is that you
 
00:34:00.769 --> 00:34:00.779 align:start position:0%
know where carriers are paying for the
 
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
bundle of newborn screening tests
 
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
um which you know presumably is an
 
00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.770 align:start position:0%
um which you know presumably is an
all-encompassing

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing
 
00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
payment for that bundle and we're not
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know uh you know when when services
 
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
are reimbursed by carriers
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
um there's there's not um kind of a
 
00:34:24.169 --> 00:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
parsing out of all of the individual
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
parts and pieces that go into a
 
00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:29.220 align:start position:0%
particular service or a particular test
 
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
um so you know for example you know the
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
cost of a syringe goes up or something
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
else changes
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
um that's kind of typically not a uh a
 
00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:44.339 align:start position:0%
separately build item just because one
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
little piece of a of a test has has gone
 
00:34:46.919 --> 00:34:47.750 align:start position:0%
little piece of a of a test has has gone
up

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
um so it's again it gets back to this
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
you know we're paying for a service
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
we're paying for a bundle
 
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
um and I think at least from the
 
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
carrier's perspective we assume that
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
that's encompassing everything
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
um Staffing supplies it's got a piece of
 
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
you know to help hospitals with overhead
 
00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.430 align:start position:0%
you know to help hospitals with overhead
Etc

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.150 align:start position:0%
Etc
um

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
so at any rate that that's our concern
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
is that um it's it's really kind of not
 
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
how reimbursement
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
um works from at least from the carrier
 
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
perspective and again I think there
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
there were other New Hampshire Ahab
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
members who will testify today but um
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh that that's what I wanted to share
 
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
with you this morning sir I have
 
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
on the call
 
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman can you hear me I was
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
having trouble sorry about that um
 
00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
um you know there's more discussion that
 
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
we can have but I think representative
 
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.210 align:start position:0%
we can have but I think representative
Marsh

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:50.220 align:start position:0%
Marsh
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
um explained it pretty well because of
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
the structure of how the filter paper is
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
paid for you cannot turn around and put
 
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
filter paper on a bill and Bill the
 
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
carrier so I think there's just a little
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding honestly and I I think
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
we can have that discussion but
 
00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
um the carriers are not acknowledging
 
00:36:15.849 --> 00:36:15.859 align:start position:0%
that because there's not a a mechanism
 
00:36:20.089 --> 00:36:20.099 align:start position:0%
to be able to effectively
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
um properly and um and clearly without
 
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:28.140 align:start position:0%
having any billing fraud um to ensure
 
00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
that that those costs are recognized you
 
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
create as representative Marsh
 
00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
identified there are codes that can be
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
build but we need the we need the
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
structure if you will we need the law to
 
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
be able to allow for that
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
um right now the the carriers really are
 
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
not seeing this this charge because of
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
the way it is currently paid for so
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to create a mechanism
 
00:36:58.970 --> 00:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
so that those
 
00:36:58.980 --> 00:36:59.630 align:start position:0%
so that those
um

00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
some of those costs can in fact get
 
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
negotiated with the carriers we're not
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
we're not saying this needs to this is a
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
mandate at all
 
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
um I think there's just needs we just
 
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
need to have further clarification
 
00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
um I I I talk with the CFOs at the
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals and they explained um what I
 
00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
just explained to you
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
um to me and I think they just
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
um there's just needs to be a mechanism
 
00:37:29.089 --> 00:37:29.099 align:start position:0%
again to be able to effectively and and
 
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
um legally
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
um build the carriers for these Services
 
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
um and there may be
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
um some hospitals that have negotiated
 
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.450 align:start position:0%
um some hospitals that have negotiated
something

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
um and been able to kind of tease out
 
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.270 align:start position:0%
um and been able to kind of tease out
something

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
um for for some of the newborn
 
00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:48.500 align:start position:0%
screenings but um that is not
 
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.270 align:start position:0%
screenings but um that is not
universally

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
universally
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
um how the hospitals are um have done it
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
um so we just that's all we're just
 
00:37:56.089 --> 00:37:56.099 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
clean it up so that it's it's more clear
 
00:37:59.810 --> 00:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
he's going to have the chair now
 
00:38:10.329 --> 00:38:10.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone this is Sabrina
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
Dunlap I am director of government
 
00:38:17.089 --> 00:38:17.099 align:start position:0%
relations at Anthem I would Echo a lot
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
of what Heidi said I think
 
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:20.940 align:start position:0%
um we're just unclear on why this issue
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
has come up and I
 
00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
spoke to our Contracting folks and this
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
has not come up on the negoti on the
 
00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:28.740 align:start position:0%
Contracting side so it just seems odd
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
insurers haven't been engaged to this
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
point and it seems like on the
 
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
reimbursement issue we would have been
 
00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:38.220 align:start position:0%
um engaged and I'm not I'm just not
 
00:38:41.089 --> 00:38:41.099 align:start position:0%
clear on my legislation is needed here
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
um even hearing Paula's answer there
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
because we just it's something that
 
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
needs to be negotiated I'm not sure what
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
a bill would do on this
 
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
um also not clear how the bill would
 
00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
play out as a practical matter it's just
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
not clear to me what that mechanism is
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
or why it's even needed um so anyway
 
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
just wanted to raise those concerns with
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
you so thanks very much
 
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Henry lippman from dhh
 
00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:22.550 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Henry lippman from dhh
yes

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Pearson and
 
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name's Henry
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
Littman I'm the Medicaid director for
 
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
the for the state
 
00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.990 align:start position:0%
the for the state
um and

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.790 align:start position:0%
um and
um understanding

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
um understanding
 
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.170 align:start position:0%
um understanding
um

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
what uh representative Marsh and uh
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
Paula menahan relayed I think from the
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program perspective we're
 
00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
concerned what we see
 
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
um out there with respect to
 
00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:51.140 align:start position:0%
um the number of birthing
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
obstetric opportunities there are in the
 
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire are declining and
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
that being able to recover some of the
 
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
costs related to this testing will be a
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
small part in trying to maintain an
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
adequate Network for Medicaid
 
00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.290 align:start position:0%
adequate Network for Medicaid
beneficiaries

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries
 
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
places where obstetric services are
 
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
disappearing are
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know more in the rural areas as well
 
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.970 align:start position:0%
you know more in the rural areas as well
and

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:20.569 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:40:20.569 --> 00:40:20.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know there are concerns about the
 
00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
continued viability of obstetric
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
services and other locations so I think
 
00:40:27.839 --> 00:40:29.089 align:start position:0%
services and other locations so I think
if

00:40:29.089 --> 00:40:29.099 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:32.420 align:start position:0%
um providing some compensation in this
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
area would be supportive to maintaining
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
it and the department I think is
 
00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
supportive in in working something out
 
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.870 align:start position:0%
supportive in in working something out
here

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Lipman is there anyone else
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.569 --> 00:40:59.579 align:start position:0%
there is uh Andrew Hosmer and Krista
 
00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
Gilbert with their hands up Andrew
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
Hosmer did you say yes yes the chair
 
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
recognizes Andrew Costner would you let
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you committee
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
my name is Andrew Hosmer I represent
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare we are
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
signing in uh opposed to this bill uh
 
00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
much like
 
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
ahip and Anthem uh it was this was not
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
an issue that we were aware of and
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
certainly think of it as an item that
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
can be negotiated between the carriers
 
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
and the providers here
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
um we think the bill as written I'm not
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
I think it creates more confusion on our
 
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:02.220 align:start position:0%
part than it does Direction and
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
certainly we think we'd look for an
 
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity to sit down with the
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
providers at some point here and craft a
 
00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.250 align:start position:0%
providers at some point here and craft a
solution

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
um outside of legislative mandates so
 
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
without taking up too much more of your
 
00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
time I appreciate the opportunity to
 
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
speak and thank you
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm representing myself
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
want to share that I um I have several
 
00:42:53.329 --> 00:42:53.339 align:start position:0%
connections to the rare disorder
 
00:42:53.339 --> 00:42:54.410 align:start position:0%
connections to the rare disorder
community

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
though I am representing myself I am the
 
00:42:59.450 --> 00:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
state ambassador for the New Hampshire
 
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
air Action Network which is an advocacy
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
Branch for the National Organization for
 
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
rare disorders I am on the rare disease
 
00:43:10.849 --> 00:43:10.859 align:start position:0%
advisory Council
 
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
um and I'm the vice president of the New
 
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rare disorders Association
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
I just want to share that I'm in support
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
um the newborn screening
 
00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:30.740 align:start position:0%
um is a diagnosis
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
conditions and is a life-saving
 
00:43:38.569 --> 00:43:38.579 align:start position:0%
disability preventing measure and I
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill would provide
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
sustainable funding that would make it
 
00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:46.859 align:start position:0%
easier to add new tests to the panel you
 
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
know this year three new tests were
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
added to the panel and as representative
 
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:55.140 align:start position:0%
Marsh stated you know there was someone
 
00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
this year that was diagnosed with a
 
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:01.140 align:start position:0%
spinal muscular atrophy which allowed
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
that individual to be treated with a new
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
medication that was really life-changing
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
for that for that child
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
is anyone on the committee have a
 
00:44:20.329 --> 00:44:20.339 align:start position:0%
question for the one who just gave test
 
00:44:20.339 --> 00:44:28.190 align:start position:0%
question for the one who just gave test
tomorrow

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
00:44:35.809 --> 00:44:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
no other hands raised
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
say that again please
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
nope there are no other hands
 
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
where's that I close the hearing on how
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
to spell 600 and at the request of the
 
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.109 align:start position:0%
to spell 600 and at the request of the
sponsor

sponsor
 
00:44:58.370 --> 00:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
move into the executive session on the
 
00:44:58.380 --> 00:44:59.630 align:start position:0%
move into the executive session on the
bill

00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
and I would give representative March as
 
00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor the first opportunity
 
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
to speak in executive session
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative Market thank you Mr
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I will move ought to pass
 
00:45:13.609 --> 00:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
and when I have a chance I'd like to
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
speak to my motion
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.079 --> 00:45:23.050 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:23.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
please thank you representative Marsh
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh those of us
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
who've been on this committee for some
 
00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
time know that our bills frequently
 
00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
provide the impetus for uh issues to get
 
00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:38.339 align:start position:0%
resolved that have not been resolved uh
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
or even shown any uh any sign of being
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
addressed in the past and and I am
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
really thankful for the insurers for
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
appearing today and and I do believe
 
00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
that as this bill moves through the
 
00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
process this may get resolved offline
 
00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
and it may get resolved to the point
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
that uh uh the bill no longer needs to
 
00:45:59.809 --> 00:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
continue to move forward that being said
 
00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
I think we need to continue this bill
 
00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
moving forward uh so that the we
 
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
maintained uh and support our our
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals we all know that we have had a
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
hospital closure recently uh in the
 
00:46:12.589 --> 00:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
middle of the State of New Hampshire we
 
00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:14.339 align:start position:0%
also know that frisbee Hospital recently
 
00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
has stopped their labor and delivery
 
00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
program I believe that is the case
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
um if we don't support those places in
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
our state where babies are delivered
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
there won't be any place in our state to
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
have babies be delivered and that is a
 
00:46:29.569 --> 00:46:29.579 align:start position:0%
real health problem that we need to
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
address so I think this is a very small
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
step towards supporting those
 
00:46:35.329 --> 00:46:35.339 align:start position:0%
institutions and I'm hoping that the
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee will agree with me
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
I heard the word Amendment floated
 
00:46:43.609 --> 00:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
sometime for the last 20 minutes is
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
there an amendment coming forward from
 
00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:49.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge Mr chairman
 
00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
um Christina are you aware of an
 
00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
amendment coming to us on this
 
00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
no I am not thank you very much anyone
 
00:47:07.809 --> 00:47:07.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
representative Kennard
 
00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:17.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I actually would just
 
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
like because it seems like the the
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
conflict here comes down to the question
 
00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:25.619 align:start position:0%
of uh do hospitals realize they can bill
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
for the filter paper do they bill for
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
the filter paper and I think
 
00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh answered that
 
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
question briefly earlier but could he
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
elaborate just a bit more so we can
 
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
understand because indeed if they simply
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
aren't because it's not allowed then
 
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
this bill really needs to go forward to
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
allow that could you could
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh clarify this issue
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
a little better
 
00:47:50.569 --> 00:47:50.579 align:start position:0%
um yes I'll be glad to do that uh filter
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
paper is clearly a supply just like a
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
syringe would be a supply or a diaper
 
00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
would be a supply hospitals do not build
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
separately for supplies however this
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
cost of the supply has been increasing
 
00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
at a very rapid rate because it is being
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
used to pay for a test the test being
 
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
the genetic tests run on the blood what
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
we are asking very simply is that the
 
00:48:17.569 --> 00:48:17.579 align:start position:0%
invoices change to read metabolic
 
00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
screening panel so that it is clear what
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
the invoices are for once that is done
 
00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
there's a their billing codes associated
 
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
with that title and at that point in
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
time negotiations can occur between the
 
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
various insurers and the the hospitals
 
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
and they can resolve this issue we're
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
not asking for an insurance mandate
 
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
we're not asking for any money to pay
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
for this we're not asking to change the
 
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
program in any way we just want to
 
00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
change the title on the top of the
 
00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:48.050 align:start position:0%
change the title on the top of the
invoices

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
 
00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.190 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
committee

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes representative Merchants if
 
00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:49:03.309 --> 00:49:03.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
sort of uh
 
00:49:08.329 --> 00:49:08.339 align:start position:0%
reinforcing what uh representative Marsh
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
is saying I don't see this as a quote
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
mandate except allowing for the
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
the ability for the biller to include
 
00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.109 align:start position:0%
the ability for the biller to include
um

00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
a mechanism to address the issue about
 
00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:23.420 align:start position:0%
the supply that goes into the testing
 
00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:26.099 align:start position:0%
and to representative Marsha's point of
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
view I totally agree that currently we
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
built for procedure codes and we built
 
00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:32.220 align:start position:0%
for things that are related to a service
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
not so much per se for supplies and this
 
00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
fundamentally allows for that to occur
 
00:49:40.089 --> 00:49:40.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
interfere with the ability between the
 
00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
insurance company and the hospital to
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
negotiate the price on the invoice
 
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
that's still left to them through the
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
normal Market channels we have today it
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
just recognizes that there is a cost and
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
a lot for that to be able to be included
 
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
on the invoice to the insurance company
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
thank you sir thank you representative
 
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
Merchant uh
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
part-time CEO of a facility that has
 
00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
three primary care providers I can tell
 
00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:12.980 align:start position:0%
you but I won't
 
00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:14.690 align:start position:0%
you but I won't
difficulties

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:14.700 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
that we sometimes have that seem to get
 
00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
resolved when legislation starts showing
 
00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:21.829 align:start position:0%
resolved when legislation starts showing
up

00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
so it could well be the case that as
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
this bill goes through the various
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
schools that
 
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
um negotiation will be satisfactorily
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
begun and concluded
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
but it's good to have a bill to help the
 
00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
process go on so I underscore
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
representative Marsha on them from
 
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
seeing it on a most daily basis anyone
 
00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.390 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.670 align:start position:0%
sorry
yeah

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson yeah I was muted I
 
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
apologize I had a question I said how
 
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
many tests are done it's one draw number
 
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
one of blood either for a newborn how
 
00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:14.900 align:start position:0%
many tests are now done on that one draw
 
00:51:17.809 --> 00:51:17.819 align:start position:0%
and how long when they go to read these
 
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
tests they just put in the machine and
 
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
zap out they come out with something I
 
00:51:23.329 --> 00:51:23.339 align:start position:0%
have no idea
 
00:51:23.339 --> 00:51:26.290 align:start position:0%
have no idea
foreign

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:26.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:28.609 --> 00:51:28.619 align:start position:0%
Dr Terrell will be the best person to
 
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for for that question
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson we currently uh we
 
00:51:47.569 --> 00:51:47.579 align:start position:0%
have uh approximately 12 000 birds in
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so we have we run
 
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
basically almost 12 000 tests sometimes
 
00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
they might be higher because uh for any
 
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
child sometimes the blood spot is not
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
enough so you might have to repeat or if
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
they are premature so we would have to
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
repeat some of those tests we have a
 
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
contract with uh University of
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Medical School that runs
 
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
the test we actually currently do 37
 
00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:13.740 align:start position:0%
tests 37 newborn different kinds of new
 
00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:16.740 align:start position:0%
uh new for different 37 different
 
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
conditions that we test for
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
so and um you know we basically can zap
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
them and get the results it takes time
 
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
it takes a roughly uh 24 hours time to
 
00:52:30.589 --> 00:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
get those results out and um that
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
information comes to us and our newborn
 
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
screening Nurse Program
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
um uh consultant basically calls up
 
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
based on if the screens are are at a
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
different level or abnormal screens we
 
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
actually follow up the both the uh reach
 
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
out to the family as well as to the
 
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:50.220 align:start position:0%
pediatrician for next steps and we also
 
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
link those families with their further
 
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
screening and further testing as well as
 
00:52:55.849 --> 00:52:55.859 align:start position:0%
the treatment
 
00:52:59.690 --> 00:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Dr Terrell anyone in
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
the committee wish to speak
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
00:53:06.849 --> 00:53:06.859 align:start position:0%
Cushman thank you Mr chairman
 
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh I'm just wondering
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
so if these newborn screenings are
 
00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.730 align:start position:0%
so if these newborn screenings are
mandated

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
uh the individuals have the right to
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
refuse the test uh that is rarely done
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
but it is allowed
 
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.069 align:start position:0%
but it is allowed
okay

00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
this is a routine screening though that
 
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
that most most parents Will consent to
 
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.210 align:start position:0%
that most most parents Will consent to
and

00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:44.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
is it Medicaid does pay for this
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
um under but but they're not paying for
 
00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
the the paper because of the billing
 
00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:55.730 align:start position:0%
the the paper because of the billing
problem

00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:55.740 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:53:58.430 --> 00:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
just trying to really we had discussions
 
00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
about this at the rare disease advisory
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
Council and according to Henry littmann
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
they consider uh the uh fee bundled into
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
their per diem under the Medicaid rate
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
and if it were recognized as a separate
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
test they'd say that they would enter
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
into negotiations such that the per diem
 
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
would go down and the test rate would
 
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
then be present and you know that's fine
 
00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
that's their process I'm perfectly happy
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
for them to go through the process uh
 
00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:24.180 align:start position:0%
and that really has nothing to do with
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
the bill what we just want is for the uh
 
00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:29.339 align:start position:0%
test to be recognized as a test and
 
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:40.980 align:start position:0%

to how to build
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
187 relative to the emergency powers of
 
00:56:37.609 --> 00:56:37.619 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of Palestinians and
 
00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:40.260 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman
 
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
I am pleased today to offer for your
 
00:56:54.049 --> 00:56:54.059 align:start position:0%
consideration House Bill 187 relative to
 
00:56:55.609 --> 00:56:55.619 align:start position:0%
the emergency powers of the Commissioner
 
00:56:57.890 --> 00:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services and I will
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that I did send out
 
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
an amendment uh last week uh I believe
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
it's zero one six one H which I intend
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
to be introducing at the same time as
 
00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:10.460 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
this bill does not address the
 
00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
governor's emergency orders other bills
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
do that I don't think they'll come to
 
00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
our committee this bill addresses
 
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
emergency orders from the commissioner
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Health and Human
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
Services of which they were too and they
 
00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
come under a separate RSA that's RSA 21p
 
00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
on April 3rd the commissioner issued an
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
emergency order regarding the
 
00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
prescribing and distribution of
 
00:57:39.049 --> 00:57:39.059 align:start position:0%
chloroquine to treat covid-19
 
00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
on September 1st she rescinded this
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
emergency order the bill also deals with
 
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
various powers under the public health
 
00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
and infectious disease laws
 
00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
let me go through the bill and hit the
 
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.490 align:start position:0%
let me go through the bill and hit the
highlights

00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
highlights
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
page one lines 13 to 14 you will note
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
that we strike in any other law to the
 
00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.470 align:start position:0%
that we strike in any other law to the
contrary

00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
contrary
 
00:58:03.049 --> 00:58:03.059 align:start position:0%
as some of you may be aware certain
 
00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:05.220 align:start position:0%
members of my family fell victim to the
 
00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:07.250 align:start position:0%
members of my family fell victim to the
Holocaust

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
Holocaust
 
00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
the role doctors and nurses played in
 
00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
the Holocaust is exceedingly troubling
 
00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:16.140 align:start position:0%
I am troubled that current law allows
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
emergency orders in New Hampshire to
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
cert supersede certain criminal laws
 
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
not that I believe our commissioner
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
would ever do that so in principle I
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
think we need to strike those words from
 
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
page one line 17-23 you can see the
 
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
current law which I believe was
 
00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
appropriately used to limit the
 
00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
distribution of hydroxychloroquine under
 
00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
the emergency order
 
00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:47.460 align:start position:0%
the commissioner identified a shortage
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
and she took actions to prevent it from
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
affecting patients
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
but I'm not convinced that the
 
00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:56.460 align:start position:0%
legislature intended to give the power
 
00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner to prevent the
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
prescribing of a drug
 
00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
that medical professionals had reason to
 
00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
believe might be effective
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
changing restrict to prioritize and
 
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
adding lines 24 to 25 and the belt and
 
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
suspenders approach we've all become
 
00:59:18.049 --> 00:59:18.059 align:start position:0%
accustomed to clarify that the
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
during build drafting the need for input
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
into the vaccine distribution plan
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
became evident
 
00:59:31.069 --> 00:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
reviewing the statute I saw that we had
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
an existing Ethics Committee so I called
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
John Williams and asked who was on it
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
he told me that this had been put in
 
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
place at the previous print pandemic for
 
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
H1N1 but there were no current
 
00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:45.829 align:start position:0%
H1N1 but there were no current
appointees

00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
appointees
 
00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
the governor subsequently reconstituted
 
00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:49.130 align:start position:0%
the governor subsequently reconstituted
it

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:49.140 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
to be ready for the next pandemic we
 
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:54.900 align:start position:0%
referenced that in lines 26 to 29 and I
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
will discuss that further in section
 
00:59:59.870 --> 00:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
page two line 16 and 17 we're changing
 
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
none of the language of the existing
 
01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
statute but we are changing the
 
01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:10.140 align:start position:0%

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:11.150 align:start position:0%
reference this is very important
actually

01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
the language of the current statute
 
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
clearly states that an individual May
 
01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
refuse treatment but the current
 
01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:19.390 align:start position:0%
refuse treatment but the current

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
is to be provided

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:46.609 align:start position:0%
quarantine and I believe appropriately
so

01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:46.619 align:start position:0%

01:01:04.849 --> 01:01:04.859 align:start position:0%
one of our objectives
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
by r i mean one of the objectives of
 
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
Health leadership is to make sure that
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
emergency orders are subject to
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight
 
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
we currently have an HHS oversight
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee so we do not need to create a
 
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
committee for this purpose
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
with a current membership of five a
 
01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
two-thirds vote would be four out of
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
five members that's an exceedingly high
 
01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:31.970 align:start position:0%
five members that's an exceedingly high
threshold

01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson and I met with John
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
Williams and others from DHHS last
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and we agreed to language
 
01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
clarifying that legislative oversight
 
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
orders under sections five and six shall
 
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
be by the ethics oversight committee
 
01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
which you will discuss in section three
 
01:01:49.849 --> 01:01:49.859 align:start position:0%
that was the origin of the amendment
 
01:01:53.329 --> 01:01:53.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
we agreed at the same meeting to delete
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
section 2 as people subject to orders
 
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
already have defined rights to appeal so
 
01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
I will just ask you to ignore that
 
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
section we're going to remove it by
 
01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:04.490 align:start position:0%
section we're going to remove it by
Amendment

01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:06.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
section three of the bill is a rewrite
 
01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
of the Ethics Committee established for
 
01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:13.559 align:start position:0%
H1N1 to accomplish five things
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
one the committee should actually have
 
01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
appointees and exist when it is needed
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
by appointing legislators to the
 
01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
committee we can make sure that will
 
01:02:23.819 --> 01:02:25.549 align:start position:0%
committee we can make sure that will
happen

01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
number two the committee should review
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
investigations orders and treatments
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
order to make sure they've been done
 
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
appropriately and fairly as some have
 
01:02:35.329 --> 01:02:35.339 align:start position:0%
questioned whether that is in fact the
 
01:02:35.339 --> 01:02:38.809 align:start position:0%
questioned whether that is in fact the
case

01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
number three last year's committee
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
members know we were contacted by an
 
01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
individual representing a disabled
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
individual who felt that their rights
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
were violated as a mask order prevented
 
01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
them from getting needed Medical Care
 
01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
we discussed having a commission to
 
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
address such concerns this Ethics
 
01:02:59.210 --> 01:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
Committee already in statute seems a
 
01:03:02.089 --> 01:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
logical place to address such concerns
 
01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
and we've charged them with doing so
 
01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:08.339 align:start position:0%
number four the governor used the state
 
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
disaster medical advisory committee to
 
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
reconstitute this Ethics Committee to
 
01:03:15.289 --> 01:03:15.299 align:start position:0%
create the vaccine distribution plan
 
01:03:18.289 --> 01:03:18.299 align:start position:0%
it was appropriate and it was well done
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
there is currently no data to suggest
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
that the current vaccines
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
provide prevent the spread of disease
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
the data shows that they prevent serious
 
01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
illness in people who get this disease
 
01:03:33.289 --> 01:03:33.299 align:start position:0%
if there were such evidence it would be
 
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
debatable whether the vaccine should
 
01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
first be deployed to protect the most
 
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
vulnerable members in our society or to
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
interrupt the vectors that spread
 
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
disease the intent is that when plans
 
01:03:47.329 --> 01:03:47.339 align:start position:0%
have to be made for the next pandemic
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
the appropriate discussion happens by an
 
01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
number five uh the part the department
 
01:03:57.049 --> 01:03:57.059 align:start position:0%
felt that the police and fire members of
 
01:03:58.970 --> 01:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
the prior incarnation of the Ethics
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
Committee did not bring to a lot to the
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
table and they asked that we removed
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
them from the committee
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment we agreed to on Wednesday
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
rewrites the section to be less
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
burdensome to the ethics oversight
 
01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
advisory committee by using Aggregate
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
and de-identified data I have I believe
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
with the current surge in covid-19 that
 
01:04:21.049 --> 01:04:21.059 align:start position:0%
burden would have become burdensome uh
 
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
last we've been in discussion with the
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
speaker's office regarding the
 
01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
membership changes to HHS oversight in
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
last year's House Bill 1245 on page nine
 
01:04:38.089 --> 01:04:38.099 align:start position:0%
we do not believe those changes were
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
intended to remove minority party input
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
from HHS oversight and the amendment
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
adds a section to undo those changes and
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
I think representative Pearson for that
 
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.289 align:start position:0%
I think representative Pearson for that
language

01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:48.299 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and I'll be glad to take
 
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:57.829 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and I'll be glad to take
questions

01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:59.089 --> 01:04:59.099 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative Nelson
 
01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
two questions uh representative Marsh in
 
01:05:09.049 --> 01:05:09.059 align:start position:0%
an emergency a dirty bomb or something
 
01:05:10.849 --> 01:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
like that and you don't have time to
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
gather people together to this committee
 
01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
what would happen
 
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:18.299 align:start position:0%
outright emergency that decision has to
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
nothing would be different compared to
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
the current procedure all the legis
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
oversight uh by this bill is done
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
retrospectively and after the fact so
 
01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
therefore we have put it in place that
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
whatever decisions were made will be
 
01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:37.140 align:start position:0%
looked at to make sure that they've been
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
done correctly and fairly uh but nothing
 
01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
would prevent emergency actions from
 
01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:43.799 align:start position:0%
needing to be taken in a short period of
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
time so we don't want to interfere with
 
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
the operations of the department in any
 
01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:49.190 align:start position:0%
the operations of the department in any
way

01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
I I did not have my hand up it's
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter Upham who is
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
Raising her hand and she's raising her
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
physical hand rather than one of the
 
01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
um representative Marsh I have
 
01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:19.460 align:start position:0%
um the original Bill and your Amendment
 
01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
and there was a
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure is there any
 
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
place in this bill that forces someone
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
to take a vaccination
 
01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:33.299 align:start position:0%
uh there's nothing in the bill that
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
forces anyone to take a vaccination the
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Health and Human
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
Services is currently allowed to order
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
treatment under the Infectious Disease
 
01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.329 align:start position:0%
treatment under the Infectious Disease
statute

01:06:44.329 --> 01:06:44.339 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:06:44.339 --> 01:06:45.490 align:start position:0%
statute
um

01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:45.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
and not that I believe she's ordered
 
01:06:51.289 --> 01:06:51.299 align:start position:0%
anybody to uh have a vaccination so that
 
01:06:53.089 --> 01:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
is currently allowed under current law
 
01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
and she would continue to have the
 
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
ability to order a treatment under the
 
01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:00.059 align:start position:0%
law as amended by this however we would
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
clarify the fact that a person so
 
01:07:04.849 --> 01:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
ordered would have the right to remain
 
01:07:06.529 --> 01:07:06.539 align:start position:0%
in quarantine and refuse treatment
 
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
whereas as I pointed out in my testimony
 
01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
there's currently a great there's
 
01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
conflict between the language and the
 
01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
bill and the statutory reference which
 
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
would not allow that to happen so uh I
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
think that the overall intent of the
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
bill is to support the right that
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
individuals have a right to refuse
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
treatment although they may need to
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
remain in quarantine if they refuse
 
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
treatment for the protection of the
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
public okay thank you very much for
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:42.529 --> 01:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Melissa sincere for
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health and Human
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
Services who's going to speak against us
 
01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes you to speak
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair and members of the committee
 
01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Melissa sancer
 
01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
I'm the chief legal officer for the
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:08:03.839 --> 01:08:05.510 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
and

01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:07.609 --> 01:08:07.619 align:start position:0%
um we um did work with representative
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
Marsh and others on the committee to
 
01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:13.140 align:start position:0%
um adjust uh certain sections of this
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
bill and there is one section that I
 
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
think we still have some concern with
 
01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
um and I would like to actually turn my
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
time over to Trish Tilly I certainly can
 
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
speak after she's done but uh Trisha
 
01:08:29.209 --> 01:08:29.219 align:start position:0%
Tilley is the deputy director of for
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
public health and um and she's going to
 
01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
raise her hand and and take my time if
 
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
if that if the committee will allow that
 
01:08:39.769 --> 01:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
is acceptable to the chair and it
 
01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
good morning this is Trisha Tilley um
 
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
yes great good morning thank you for the
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak about the
 
01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
fundamental powers of the department to
 
01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
control mitigate and prevent infectious
 
01:08:59.090 --> 01:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
disease during Public Health emergencies
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
as you know my name is Patricia Tilley
 
01:09:03.169 --> 01:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
and I'm the deputy director of the
 
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health at the
 
01:09:07.249 --> 01:09:07.259 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
these powers to isolate quarantine or
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
control access to an exposure are
 
01:09:15.289 --> 01:09:15.299 align:start position:0%
designed to protect the public to
 
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
protect you and me and by preventing
 
01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
exposure to people who have or may have
 
01:09:22.849 --> 01:09:22.859 align:start position:0%
a contagious disease or places or
 
01:09:24.769 --> 01:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
conditions that are unhealthy
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner also has the authority
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
and duty to control and potentially
 
01:09:33.789 --> 01:09:33.799 align:start position:0%
ration the use or sale of life-saving
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals and to prioritize which
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
groups may have access during a public
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
health emergency as described by
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh's introduction
 
01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:46.259 align:start position:0%
these powers are designed to be used
 
01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
sparingly and only in extreme cases as
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
attorney Saint Seer can better explain
 
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
in the details of the legal language
 
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
there are current safety nets for due
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
process already built into the statute
 
01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
for individuals directly impacted by an
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
official order individuals may request a
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
hearing in Superior Court in accordance
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire RSA 141c as
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh also noted
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
never in our lifetimes have the powers
 
01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
these Powers been so visible and so
 
01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
needed to the extent that we are seeing
 
01:10:21.719 --> 01:10:22.610 align:start position:0%
needed to the extent that we are seeing
today

01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's Authority is an
 
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
important tool in our toolbox to swiftly
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
control outbreaks and disease and we
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
have used the expertise of
 
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
epidemiologists Physicians and others to
 
01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:39.380 align:start position:0%
help guide us through these complex
 
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
ethical decisions
 
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
even in the emergency we are currently
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
experiencing there have only been two
 
01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
official orders under p21 made by the
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
commissioner of DHHS
 
01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
we have worked closely with the sponsor
 
01:10:59.149 --> 01:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
of the bill and we welcome the notion of
 
01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
review by joint legislative oversight
 
01:11:03.649 --> 01:11:03.659 align:start position:0%
committee as well as the ethics
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
oversight advisory committee to review
 
01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
patterns and to make recommendations
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
we understand that it is not the intent
 
01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
to create a committee by which Swift and
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
Urgent decisions are made in real time
 
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
to keep the public safe or to routinely
 
01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
overturn these emergency decisions
 
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
we all agree that the privacy and health
 
01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
information of individuals must be
 
01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:30.050 align:start position:0%
information of individuals must be
maintained

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
maintained
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
we look forward to the opportunity to
 
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
working with committees as described in
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
the bill but we are still concerned
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
about the ability of joint legislative
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
committee to overturn decisions made by
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
attorney Saint Seer will be able to walk
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
us through the details of the lingual
 
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
language in both RSA 21p and RSA 141c
 
01:11:59.090 --> 01:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
it's important to keep in mind the
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
difference in the types of orders that
 
01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
are made
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
so we have one set of orders that have
 
01:12:06.649 --> 01:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
been made through the emergency Powers
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
as representative March described that
 
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
talked about the prioritizing of
 
01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:14.219 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals and then we have another
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
set of orders of quarantine and
 
01:12:21.010 --> 01:12:21.020 align:start position:0%
isolation that are generally fall under
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
RSA 141c and that those orders are
 
01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
related to keeping people safe
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
um from infectious disease and ordering
 
01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
folks to quarantine or to potentially to
 
01:12:38.570 --> 01:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
receive treatment if not quarantine so
 
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
I'm going to hand the time back to uh
 
01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
attorney Saint Sierra she can point to
 
01:12:46.610 --> 01:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
the specific references but we wanted to
 
01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
come today and say that we appreciate
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
and we are willing to work hand in hand
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
with the sponsors of this bill we think
 
01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
that there's an opportunity for us to
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
move forward but we still have concerns
 
01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:01.100 align:start position:0%
about the ability to overturn decisions
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner thank you
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
representative uh March do you wish to
 
01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
speak at this time or after uh councilor
 
01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
sincere speaks
 
01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
let me just say that we did meet and I
 
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
believe that the department and those of
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
us who met with the Department agreed on
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
almost every point
 
01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
the only issue that we did not reach
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
agreement is on page it's on page two of
 
01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
the bill it's on page three of the PDF
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
line 31 and that would be the language
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
that says and may be rescinded by a
 
01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
two-thirds vote of that committee
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day this is a
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
balance of powers issue either the
 
01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
legislature has the right to say no when
 
01:13:51.169 --> 01:13:51.179 align:start position:0%
something is Extreme
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
buy a super majority vote it's a very
 
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
high super majority vote actually or
 
01:13:58.189 --> 01:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
they do not and that's a fundamental
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
policy decision that needs to be decided
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
and I do not anticipate that the
 
01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
department will ever agree with us on
 
01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:06.790 align:start position:0%
department will ever agree with us on
that

01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
and we'll just continue to discuss this
 
01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
going forward so thank you very much
 
01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
point of procedure Mr chairman thank you
 
01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:17.930 align:start position:0%
point of procedure Mr chairman thank you
guys

01:14:17.930 --> 01:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
um normally we have a sponsor testify
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
and then other people testify but I
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
don't remember any time in the past when
 
01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
the sponsor has been allowed recognized
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
to answer each subsequent person as they
 
01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
testify that would happen either at a
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting or at an executive
 
01:14:46.610 --> 01:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
session and I think it's a bad precedent
 
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
to be setting to allow the sponsor uh
 
01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
second dibs and third dibs and fourth
 
01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:55.130 align:start position:0%
second dibs and third dibs and fourth
dibs

01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
dibs
 
01:14:57.770 --> 01:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
it is of course up to the chairman but I
 
01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
just note that for the record thank you
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weber duly noted the
 
01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes again counselor
 
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much Mr chairman members of
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
um so for the bill representative Marsh
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
is correct it is
 
01:15:18.649 --> 01:15:18.659 align:start position:0%
um paragraph eight where
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
um the the committee would have the
 
01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
ability to rescind
 
01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh in order that was was created by our
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner through obviously uh the
 
01:15:35.689 --> 01:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
use of of experts and and otherwise to
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
um we would like to change that to
 
01:15:37.679 --> 01:15:39.649 align:start position:0%
um we would like to change that to
recommendations

01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
um the oversight committee right now for
 
01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services obviously is
 
01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
the legislative oversight committee for
 
01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:46.140 align:start position:0%
the Department
 
01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:48.179 align:start position:0%
um the statute specifically says that
 
01:15:50.450 --> 01:15:50.460 align:start position:0%
it's to support cost-effective
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Coordinated Care
 
01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
um it's it's also to promote greater
 
01:15:57.290 --> 01:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
efficiencies consolidating and
 
01:15:59.090 --> 01:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
centralizing Reporting requirements and
 
01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
other responsibilities of the department
 
01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
to avoid duplication and efforts and and
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
so I just want to note that typically
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
our relationship with Health and Human
 
01:16:11.209 --> 01:16:11.219 align:start position:0%
Services oversight committee is is is
 
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
for that purpose we do a lot of
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
reporting to them and they definitely
 
01:16:19.729 --> 01:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
are involved in in the work that the
 
01:16:21.169 --> 01:16:21.179 align:start position:0%
department does providing
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations and so we think that
 
01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
that would be an appropriate amendment
 
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
to this bill if that we could change
 
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
that recision being able to rescind our
 
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
our experts decision making around this
 
01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
to just being recommendations made to
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
the commissioner by by the Health and
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
Human Services oversight Committee in
 
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
that paragraph I think our other concern
 
01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
other than just
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
um you know that language is that it
 
01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
seems to be very broad it says any
 
01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:53.219 align:start position:0%
emergency order issued under
 
01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
um under this section and and when
 
01:16:57.770 --> 01:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
speaking with representative Marsh he he
 
01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
made it very clear that the expectation
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be to
 
01:17:05.530 --> 01:17:05.540 align:start position:0%
um you know review every order and that
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
paragraphs what was previously
 
01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
paragraphs or maybe they still are
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
paragraphs five and six where it's
 
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
um ordering somebody to go through some
 
01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
type of medical treatment as well as
 
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:20.940 align:start position:0%
compelling an investigation if we're
 
01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
investigating a a
 
01:17:26.930 --> 01:17:26.940 align:start position:0%
facility for not doing appropriate care
 
01:17:29.689 --> 01:17:29.699 align:start position:0%
or whatnot around the emergency that
 
01:17:32.209 --> 01:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
that those two would kind of be carved
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
out in the amendment those two would be
 
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
carved out and they would be subject to
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
oversight by the Ethics Committee but I
 
01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
also think that other than just those
 
01:17:41.689 --> 01:17:41.699 align:start position:0%
two paragraphs there are other things
 
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
within the 21 on p53 which is what we're
 
01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
amending here that there are some Powers
 
01:17:50.209 --> 01:17:50.219 align:start position:0%
just specifically paragraph one where
 
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has the responsibility
 
01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
and authority to carry out all public
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
health activities within the state if if
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
all of if while carrying out all of her
 
01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
Public Health activities
 
01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
um her his uh her at this point
 
01:18:07.610 --> 01:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
um that that those would be subject to
 
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
um rescission any decision made under
 
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
paragraph one would be subject to
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
rescission and I understand form
 
01:18:13.729 --> 01:18:13.739 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh that that's not the
 
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
expectation but I do believe that that
 
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
currently as drafted it is much more
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
broad than than what we had discussed
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
and so I'm just concerned from a legal
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
perspective that that there is a breath
 
01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
to this order or to this bill that would
 
01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
um allow for orders to be overturned for
 
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
essentially anything that the
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner has the responsibility for
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
so so that that's just um all I I have
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
to say I'm certainly happy to answer a
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
question any questions that you have
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.189 --> 01:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative Cushman
 
01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman representative
 
01:18:56.689 --> 01:18:56.699 align:start position:0%
Marsh can you please just clarify for
 
01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
the committee exactly what your
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment changes about the bill like
 
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Marty
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh yes I'm right here just let me bring
 
01:19:12.649 --> 01:19:12.659 align:start position:0%
the amendment up on the screen it'll
 
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
okay I now have on my screen Amendment
 
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:29.640 align:start position:0%

01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
which I circulated to the committee last
 
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:34.260 align:start position:0%

of all we deleted section uh two of the
bill

bill
 
01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
um which would have given
 
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
more appeal rights to people who were
 
01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
subject to emergency orders under
 
01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
paragraphs five and six previously
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned because we realized that they
 
01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
already have those appeal rights and uh
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
so therefore that section of the bill
 
01:20:02.450 --> 01:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
becomes unnecessary uh second we added a
 
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
paragraph nine after paragraph eight
 
01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
paragraph eight being the uh paragraph
 
01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
that has the rescinding of clause in it
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
that everybody is questioning about and
 
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph nine specifically carves out
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
orders issued under paragraph five or
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
six as attorney said uh and assigns that
 
01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
oversight to the ethics oversight
 
01:20:25.729 --> 01:20:25.739 align:start position:0%
advisory committee uh which is precisely
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
what you said
 
01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.390 align:start position:0%
what you said
um

01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh then we moved what was previously
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
section three of the bill up into
 
01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
section two because we had deleted
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
section two uh and we reworded the uh uh
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
charge to the ethics oversight advisory
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
committee to make clear that these uh
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
that their oversight was being done in
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
aggregate with uh de-identified data
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
um and and the that language came from
 
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
the department and when we agreed to it
 
01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:58.850 align:start position:0%
the department and when we agreed to it
entirely

01:20:58.850 --> 01:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh and the last thing is we added a
 
01:21:05.209 --> 01:21:05.219 align:start position:0%
section uh to the bill to change the
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
membership of the Health and Human
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
Services oversight committee uh because
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
the number of us uh separately have
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
realized that that it may be problematic
 
01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
for a great many reasons and this is the
 
01:21:19.490 --> 01:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
only Bill currently in the legislature
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge whereby it would be
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
germane to change the membership of the
 
01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services oversight
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
committee because we're talking about a
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
charge to the Health and Human Services
 
01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
oversight committee so that in very
 
01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
briefly is what the amendment does
 
01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
point of order again Mr chairman yes
 
01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
well I believe it was the department who
 
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
was testifying and we have now had the
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill helpful and clear as
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
he is and I applaud him for that has now
 
01:21:55.209 --> 01:21:55.219 align:start position:0%
testified four times on the bill uh
 
01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
questions as they come in during
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
hearings should be only to the person
 
01:22:05.209 --> 01:22:05.219 align:start position:0%
who is currently testifying and when we
 
01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
get through all the testimony of all the
 
01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
people who want to talk to us that's the
 
01:22:12.770 --> 01:22:12.780 align:start position:0%
time for us to have the discussion among
 
01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
ourselves about clarifications changes
 
01:22:19.610 --> 01:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
and other things but it is inappropriate
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
to have the bill sponsor testify
 
01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.410 align:start position:0%
to have the bill sponsor testify
repeatedly

01:22:24.410 --> 01:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
repeatedly
 
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
thank you again newly noted thank you
 
01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
representative McKay
 
01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:35.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
introduce the amendment
 
01:22:40.850 --> 01:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard a motion to introduce
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
this event
 
01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:43.490 align:start position:0%
this event
he

01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
he
 
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
he was attempting to explain it less
 
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
when we go through the bill we read
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
things that won't be there because my
 
01:22:54.290 --> 01:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
concern is that we're discussing
 
01:22:56.770 --> 01:22:56.780 align:start position:0%
something that's not in front of us
 
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking you know procedure
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
that but I think the proper thing would
 
01:23:06.410 --> 01:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
be for him because I like the Amendments
 
01:23:09.169 --> 01:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
that it should be actually presented to
 
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
us as an amendment
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
I believe in the exact session it will
 
01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:17.450 align:start position:0%
I believe in the exact session it will
be

01:23:17.450 --> 01:23:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
but let me uh and if I may Mr chairman
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
we have always allowed sponsors to bring
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
an amendment with them when they
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
presented the bill initially and to run
 
01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:33.380 align:start position:0%
through it as part of their initial
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
presentation that Christina please bring
 
01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:51.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
if Mr Walsh is available would you
 
01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.090 --> 01:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I had to crush my hand up for a
 
01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
let's see if Mr Walsh is here and if not
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
I'll recognize you and if he is I'll
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
take you next
 
01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
I do not currently see Mr Welsh in that
 
01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
case the chair recognizes it sounds like
 
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
representative Kennard yes sir
 
01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
yes my question is for Melissa Saints
 
01:24:22.669 --> 01:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
here her comment toward the end was she
 
01:24:25.130 --> 01:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
felt that this was too broad my question
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
is are can you give us some guidance of
 
01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
how it might be narrowed in a way that
 
01:24:33.729 --> 01:24:33.739 align:start position:0%
would be acceptable to DHHS
 
01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative for your
 
01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:37.189 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative for your
question

01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:24:40.490 --> 01:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
um we believe that
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
the rescission makes the power to
 
01:24:47.090 --> 01:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
broaden the ability to rescind so if the
 
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
the paragraph Was adjusted that any
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
emergency order issued should be subject
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
to review by The Joint legislative
 
01:24:56.810 --> 01:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
committee and recommendations made to
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
the commissioner that would be
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
acceptable language and would would
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
obviously save our concerns but but
 
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
um we would we would welcome
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations by the by the commission
 
01:25:12.530 --> 01:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
to hopefully
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
um you know give us any feedback related
 
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
to orders that may have been issued by
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
the commissioner that they feel
 
01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
um you know we're not done appropriately
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
didn't take appropriate information or
 
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
whatnot and so that would be our
 
01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:29.390 align:start position:0%
whatnot and so that would be our
recommendation

01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.450 --> 01:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
any follow-up
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
no thank you welcome anyone else in the
 
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
the chairman recognizes Kevin Casserly
 
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%

um that is uh that I have here appears
 
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
to address
 
01:27:45.169 --> 01:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
um the concern the main concerns I had
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
with the bill
 
01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:47.930 align:start position:0%
with the bill
um

01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
in particular uh the concern was the the
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
original Bill appeared to make uh Court
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction discretionary because of
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
the words uh if the petition is granted
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh now that section has been uh removed
 
01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh and uh it defers to the original
 
01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:14.699 align:start position:0%
language in 141c so uh I support uh
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
strongly support the bill I feel it's a
 
01:28:21.250 --> 01:28:21.260 align:start position:0%
um a necessary clarification
 
01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
of the existing powers of the
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner and they also support the
 
01:28:27.649 --> 01:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
amendment and with that all in my
 
01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:30.300 align:start position:0%

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:08.090 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:29:08.090 --> 01:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:10.970 --> 01:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
and I should have done some when I
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%

01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
did before and with apologies to the
 
01:29:17.629 --> 01:29:17.639 align:start position:0%

01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
motion I take now I believe yes I move
 
01:29:59.229 --> 01:29:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:04.729 --> 01:30:04.739 align:start position:0%
second so representative Solomon
 
01:30:04.739 --> 01:30:05.870 align:start position:0%

01:30:05.870 --> 01:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:09.890 align:start position:0%
now
um

01:30:09.890 --> 01:30:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:15.169 --> 01:30:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.169 --> 01:30:18.179 align:start position:0%
I I am not certain that the committee
 
01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
really wants to uh exact the bill at
 
01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:21.900 align:start position:0%
this time
 
01:30:24.110 --> 01:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
um but I'm satisfied personally with
 
01:30:27.169 --> 01:30:27.179 align:start position:0%
Amendment zero one six one H I believe
 
01:30:29.930 --> 01:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
it addresses all of the Department's
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
concerns uh with the exception of their
 
01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:34.739 align:start position:0%
one concern that they do not wish to
 
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
have the oversight committee to have the
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
authority uh even on a super majority
 
01:30:42.890 --> 01:30:42.900 align:start position:0%
vote to uh rescind an emergency order
 
01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
and I believe that to be used uh very
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
occasionally and by a super majority
 
01:30:51.649 --> 01:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
vote it is an appropriate uh uh a power
 
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
for the the committee to have so uh I
 
01:30:57.050 --> 01:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
would prefer that the bill move forward
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:08.750 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
our general feeling is that there is
 
01:31:14.810 --> 01:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
some value in this and then there are
 
01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
some problems with this
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
I would prefer in the executive session
 
01:31:24.290 --> 01:31:24.300 align:start position:0%
that we retain the bill for other than
 
01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:27.729 align:start position:0%
that we retain the bill for other than
um

01:31:27.729 --> 01:31:27.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:30.530 --> 01:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
representative McKay we have a motion on
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
the floor about the Amendments but then
 
01:31:35.330 --> 01:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
when it is time to
 
01:31:38.570 --> 01:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
consider the bill has amended that I
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
believe then that would be
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
a good time perhaps I just want to sneak
 
01:31:45.649 --> 01:31:45.659 align:start position:0%
it in
 
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:57.890 --> 01:31:57.900 align:start position:0%
yes by representative gay
 
01:31:59.689 --> 01:31:59.699 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I'm sure to thank you
 
01:32:02.590 --> 01:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question or my statement
 
01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
banking is always a good thing I don't
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
know either but go ahead okay
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
um the impression I'm getting is that
 
01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:32:17.090 --> 01:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh did a good job of removing some
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
things that felt onerous
 
01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
and it retains the real point the whole
 
01:32:26.570 --> 01:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
point that I can see of this bill
 
01:32:31.250 --> 01:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
is to give legislative oversight to
 
01:32:34.729 --> 01:32:34.739 align:start position:0%
decisions earlier even though it was
 
01:32:38.570 --> 01:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
and motivated by very high intentions
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
one of the statements one of the
 
01:32:49.689 --> 01:32:49.699 align:start position:0%
decisions by the commissioner this year
 
01:32:53.209 --> 01:32:53.219 align:start position:0%
outlawed the use of a medicine that has
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
since been proven to be effective
 
01:32:59.050 --> 01:32:59.060 align:start position:0%
and so that really should not have stood
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
this is the only way to prevent that
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
from happening so I totally support the
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
amendment because I totally support the
 
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.930 align:start position:0%
amendment because I totally support the
bill

01:33:10.930 --> 01:33:10.940 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak
 
01:33:19.490 --> 01:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman representative Weber is her
 
01:33:20.689 --> 01:33:20.699 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
okay I can't see if I'm here
 
01:33:24.649 --> 01:33:24.659 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:33:26.450 --> 01:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I was just
 
01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
wondering if we had time to work on the
 
01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:30.770 align:start position:0%
wondering if we had time to work on the
bill

01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
or is this a bill that needs to be exact
 
01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:34.430 align:start position:0%
or is this a bill that needs to be exact
today

01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
it does not need to be exact today
 
01:33:41.810 --> 01:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
my concern and I have to balance
 
01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
not wishing to
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
run jobs with the fact that Not only was
 
01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
the calendar extremely tied we still do
 
01:33:54.890 --> 01:33:54.900 align:start position:0%
not know if we're going to be needing in
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
any capacity tomorrow
 
01:33:57.719 --> 01:33:58.310 align:start position:0%
any capacity tomorrow
um

01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know how many days I'm being
 
01:34:04.129 --> 01:34:04.139 align:start position:0%
assigned so there is a concern
 
01:34:07.490 --> 01:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
um I might underscore what people have
 
01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
been saying that really it is do we or
 
01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
do we not believe that with a high bar
 
01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:15.470 align:start position:0%
do we not believe that with a high bar
threshold

01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee should have some
 
01:34:22.370 --> 01:34:22.380 align:start position:0%
say in rescinding good thing yeah that's
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
it right I understand what the concerns
 
01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
is I was just trying to find out if we
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
had time
 
01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
but I realized that this vote is on the
 
01:34:35.209 --> 01:34:35.219 align:start position:0%
amendment and so I will I will state
 
01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
that I think the amendment solves
 
01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
certain issues that have already been
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
raised to everybody's satisfaction so
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
um I am going to state that I will vote
 
01:34:47.209 --> 01:34:47.219 align:start position:0%
for the amendment and then when we get
 
01:34:50.689 --> 01:34:50.699 align:start position:0%
to the bill itself we can discuss
 
01:34:52.490 --> 01:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
whether we want to go forward or whether
 
01:34:54.530 --> 01:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
more work needs to happen
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
and I I will ask you a question please
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
because I couldn't find it at Mason's
 
01:35:02.689 --> 01:35:02.699 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor
 
01:35:04.850 --> 01:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
of the amendments
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
do I as co-sponsor slash chair
 
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
have the right to speak for about 30
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
seconds absolutely when when we get to
 
01:35:17.209 --> 01:35:17.219 align:start position:0%
Executive session everybody can speak
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
and the chair or at least the former
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
chair often drafted amendments and spoke
 
01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
to them and and it's only in the hearing
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
that we are deferential uh to the rights
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
of the public so that the the sponsors
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:36.530 align:start position:0%
are not
um

01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:38.570 --> 01:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
um given both the opportunity to be a
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
see what you said earlier
 
01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
shouting open
 
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
it's quite all right
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
01:35:56.689 --> 01:35:56.699 align:start position:0%
um but but you you go go right ahead and
 
01:35:58.729 --> 01:35:58.739 align:start position:0%
you know whatever your opinions are
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
everybody has a right to their opinions
 
01:36:02.689 --> 01:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
in an executive session
 
01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
as my mother used to say you have the
 
01:36:07.129 --> 01:36:07.139 align:start position:0%
right to be wrong
 
01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's been 30 seconds on the
 
01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:10.450 align:start position:0%
I think it's been 30 seconds on the
amendments

01:36:10.450 --> 01:36:10.460 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
two-thirds vote
 
01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
is a high bar and in the amendment we
 
01:36:19.090 --> 01:36:19.100 align:start position:0%
have given some a point of authority
 
01:36:21.649 --> 01:36:21.659 align:start position:0%
specifically to the minority leader
 
01:36:24.250 --> 01:36:24.260 align:start position:0%
which wasn't there before
 
01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
secondly at least some of the oversight
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
committee people are medical people in
 
01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
some capacity or another so it is not an
 
01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:35.699 align:start position:0%
oversight committee being made of
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
farmers and mechanics and speaking to
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
Medical people it's not quite that and
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
then thirdly
 
01:36:45.229 --> 01:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
this is a safety boundary
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
I've got two pages of people who signed
 
01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:49.250 align:start position:0%
I've got two pages of people who signed
in

01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:36:52.930 --> 01:36:52.940 align:start position:0%
in favor of this right
 
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
citizens or the citizens legislature and
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
have the ability to overrule a
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
government edit
 
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
quite honestly safety valves are very
 
01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:05.390 align:start position:0%
quite honestly safety valves are very
important

01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:37:07.729 --> 01:37:07.739 align:start position:0%
because if you put too much steam
 
01:37:07.739 --> 01:37:09.290 align:start position:0%
because if you put too much steam
pressure

01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
pressure
 
01:37:12.530 --> 01:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
in a container with no vent
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
eventually it might blow
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
and I don't want that
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
so to have at least on paper
 
01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
the knowledge to people that it is
 
01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
possible for the citizens to say wait a
 
01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
minute here I think May provide a safety
 
01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
valve without it being
 
01:37:34.970 --> 01:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
you know the inmates taking over the
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
Asylum part of the industry so for that
 
01:37:39.890 --> 01:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
reason I not only supported
 
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately I I wrote it
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
with representative Marsh and have to be
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
taught to DHHS
 
01:37:50.570 --> 01:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
uh representative Copeland you had your
 
01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
hand up please
 
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
 
01:37:56.930 --> 01:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
um I I believe that this amendment moves
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
the bill in the right direction I also
 
01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
agree with representative gay that um to
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
um to to do anything to to change the
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
existing measures in the Bill of the
 
01:38:12.050 --> 01:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
amendment uh for a two-thirds super
 
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
majority uh would essentially uh remove
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
the fundamental purpose of the bill
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
which is to provide legislative
 
01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.149 align:start position:0%
which is to provide legislative
oversight

01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:38:23.450 --> 01:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
for what it's worth I'm actually not
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
totally comfortable with the idea of a
 
01:38:28.850 --> 01:38:28.860 align:start position:0%
two-thirds super majority I will vote
 
01:38:30.649 --> 01:38:30.659 align:start position:0%
for the amendment and I vote will vote
 
01:38:32.090 --> 01:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
for the bill because I think that it
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
moves things in the right direction I
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
will also point out that the two-thirds
 
01:38:39.770 --> 01:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
majority because there are five members
 
01:38:43.850 --> 01:38:43.860 align:start position:0%
um actually is a de facto 80 majority
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that uh as it is
 
01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
currently written
 
01:38:53.090 --> 01:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
um it is entirely reasonable
 
01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
um to uh to to ask for that I think it
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
would be uh even more reasonable to ask
 
01:39:02.330 --> 01:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
for a smaller number uh but uh but I
 
01:39:04.610 --> 01:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
would support the amendment as it is I
 
01:39:06.050 --> 01:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
think a lot of work has gone into this
 
01:39:08.689 --> 01:39:08.699 align:start position:0%
bill I think it moves uh moves things in
 
01:39:10.250 --> 01:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
the right direction and I support the
 
01:39:14.209 --> 01:39:14.219 align:start position:0%
amendment the ability of the oversight
 
01:39:14.219 --> 01:39:15.410 align:start position:0%
amendment the ability of the oversight
committee

01:39:15.410 --> 01:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:17.030 align:start position:0%
committee
who

01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:18.530 align:start position:0%
who
percent

01:39:18.530 --> 01:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:39:20.930 --> 01:39:20.940 align:start position:0%
kicks in simultaneously
 
01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:22.250 align:start position:0%
kicks in simultaneously
with

01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
The increased number of people
 
01:39:27.290 --> 01:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
so there'll be seven not five
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
maybe you can do the math in your head
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
but two-thirds of seven okay thank you
 
01:39:38.050 --> 01:39:38.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%

01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
let's see if we can Mr chairman that
 
01:42:58.850 --> 01:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
would be zero one six one-h zero one six
 
01:43:09.490 --> 01:43:09.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:31.129 --> 01:43:31.139 align:start position:0%
two from the Senate fighting from
 
01:43:31.139 --> 01:43:36.770 align:start position:0%
two from the Senate fighting from
accounts

01:43:36.770 --> 01:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:38.570 --> 01:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman would you like me to just
 
01:43:40.370 --> 01:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
read it
 
01:43:42.890 --> 01:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
I think he's found it
 
01:43:45.229 --> 01:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
but you can read it out loud too I would
 
01:43:49.149 --> 01:43:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
the the changes are it it as you know or
 
01:43:58.490 --> 01:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
as you may not know in one of the
 
01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
um Omnibus bills the membership of the
 
01:44:04.010 --> 01:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services oversight
 
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
committee was reduced from its former
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
five house members to three house
 
01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
members which creates enormous amounts
 
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
of concern in terms of
 
01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
representation both from you know the
 
01:44:22.910 --> 01:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
various committees and also uh for the
 
01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
minority and so this would put it back
 
01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
it leaves the Senate at two which is
 
01:44:32.209 --> 01:44:32.219 align:start position:0%
where the Senate wants to be it would
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
have five members of The house's
 
01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
Representatives three of whom from hell
 
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
are from Health and Human Services and
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
one from the house finance committee
 
01:44:45.290 --> 01:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
division responsible for Health and
 
01:44:47.810 --> 01:44:47.820 align:start position:0%
Human Services which is essentially as
 
01:44:49.729 --> 01:44:49.739 align:start position:0%
it is now but with the clarification
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
that it's from uh Division I think it's
 
01:44:56.570 --> 01:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
three and then two members of the House
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
of Representatives one of whom shall be
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
appointed by the speaker and one of whom
 
01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
shall be appointed by the leader of the
 
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
minority party and these two are going
 
01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
to serve as alternates so at a time when
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
we cannot get a full compliment which is
 
01:45:18.050 --> 01:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
practically every meeting for one reason
 
01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
or another there are two dedicated
 
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
alternates to sub in for the five
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
members that we have now so we're we're
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
basically returning it to the way it was
 
01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
with five members one of whom is going
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
to be from finance and three of whom are
 
01:45:35.890 --> 01:45:35.900 align:start position:0%
protected from Health and Human Services
 
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
um we are are adding the two alternates
 
01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
one from each party so that they can be
 
01:45:44.930 --> 01:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
appointed if needed
 
01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
is that a fair summary representative
 
01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:47.930 align:start position:0%
is that a fair summary representative
Marsh

01:45:47.930 --> 01:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
Marsh
 
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.490 --> 01:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
and there are also two senators we
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
so there are seven yes so there are
 
01:46:03.229 --> 01:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
seven people in all
 
01:46:09.169 --> 01:46:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:17.209 align:start position:0%
 
committee

01:46:17.209 --> 01:46:17.219 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
I believe representative salloway was
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
asking a question no just seeing him I
 
01:46:27.890 --> 01:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:29.689 --> 01:46:29.699 align:start position:0%
he's waving off
 
01:46:33.770 --> 01:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:36.169 --> 01:46:36.179 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:46:39.050 --> 01:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman so just to speak
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
on the bill now please
 
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
as amended I support this bill
 
01:46:47.330 --> 01:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
um we've seen some overreach during this
 
01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:49.980 align:start position:0%
emergency I feel we've seen the rights
 
01:46:51.410 --> 01:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
of prescribing Physicians to order
 
01:46:53.930 --> 01:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
medications that they deem appropriate
 
01:46:56.810 --> 01:46:56.820 align:start position:0%
to treat patients be restricted we've
 
01:46:58.970 --> 01:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
seen that the legislature has had little
 
01:47:00.109 --> 01:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
to no
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
power over emergency orders
 
01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
um and I personally would like a lower
 
01:47:07.250 --> 01:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
majority on the oversight committee but
 
01:47:09.169 --> 01:47:09.179 align:start position:0%
I again I think that this is a good
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.629 --> 01:47:17.639 align:start position:0%
which I recognizes representative Bolton
 
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:22.729 --> 01:47:22.739 align:start position:0%
um I am also in support of this bill as
 
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
amended for the reason that the chair
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
gave of it being a safety valve for the
 
01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
people who are so frustrated that they
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
have no control and
 
01:47:39.890 --> 01:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
um that is what I have seen out our way
 
01:47:44.810 --> 01:47:44.820 align:start position:0%
develop into anger and just knowing that
 
01:47:48.050 --> 01:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
there is going to be a safety valve that
 
01:47:50.270 --> 01:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
they actually have
 
01:47:53.930 --> 01:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
summary of recourse will bring a whole
 
01:47:57.169 --> 01:47:57.179 align:start position:0%
lot more comfort and will dial down
 
01:47:59.689 --> 01:47:59.699 align:start position:0%
the anger and frustration that has been
 
01:47:59.699 --> 01:48:08.209 align:start position:0%
the anger and frustration that has been
felt

01:48:08.209 --> 01:48:08.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
there's no other
 
01:48:12.290 --> 01:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
questions or statements representative
 
01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
snow has his hand raised
 
01:48:18.109 --> 01:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
the purposes of clarification
 
01:48:22.669 --> 01:48:22.679 align:start position:0%
we now have five members and two
 
01:48:24.770 --> 01:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
alternates are the two alternates
 
01:48:28.189 --> 01:48:28.199 align:start position:0%
clearly identified as alternates and do
 
01:48:30.530 --> 01:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
they sometimes show up at meetings and
 
01:48:32.330 --> 01:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
find out if everybody else is there so
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
and see the purpose of the alternate as
 
01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
if the chair of the oversight committee
 
01:48:47.209 --> 01:48:47.219 align:start position:0%
understands the day before somebody on
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
vacation somebody said that an alternate
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
would be asked to come in to fill that's
 
01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.970 align:start position:0%
would be asked to come in to fill that's
fine

01:48:55.970 --> 01:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
fine
 
01:48:59.390 --> 01:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
so ordinarily how did okay
 
01:49:01.609 --> 01:49:01.619 align:start position:0%
so then the two alternates are clearly
 
01:49:04.129 --> 01:49:04.139 align:start position:0%
identified but they would not attend a
 
01:49:06.350 --> 01:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
meeting unless invited to attend and
 
01:49:07.970 --> 01:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
would not participate in other meetings
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
I would invite them to attend
 
01:49:14.450 --> 01:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
and participate
 
01:49:18.970 --> 01:49:18.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
if they take the place of one of the
 
01:49:27.050 --> 01:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
statutory members but be there their
 
01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:29.450 align:start position:0%
statutory members but be there their
wisdom

01:49:29.450 --> 01:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
wisdom
 
01:49:31.850 --> 01:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
everything except voted
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
and they act clearly identified so they
 
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
know they may not get to vote
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.770 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
Shapiro

01:49:42.770 --> 01:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:44.689 --> 01:49:44.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:49:44.699 --> 01:49:45.950 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:48.169 --> 01:49:48.179 align:start position:0%
first of all I want to thank um
 
01:49:50.330 --> 01:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh for being so
 
01:49:52.970 --> 01:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
attentive to detail and so attentive to
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
explaining the detail which I'm still
 
01:49:57.050 --> 01:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
not sure I understand
 
01:49:58.970 --> 01:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
um but I appreciate it
 
01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:02.159 align:start position:0%
um also for creating the high bar for
 
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
um overturning an emergency decision by
 
01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:07.990 align:start position:0%
um overturning an emergency decision by
HHS

01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
HHS
 
01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:10.679 align:start position:0%
given my appreciation for those things
 
01:50:12.649 --> 01:50:12.659 align:start position:0%
unlike some of the other people who have
 
01:50:12.659 --> 01:50:14.410 align:start position:0%
unlike some of the other people who have
spoken

01:50:14.410 --> 01:50:14.420 align:start position:0%
spoken
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
I probably
 
01:50:19.970 --> 01:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm more concerned about the lack of
 
01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
forceful guidance from our state
 
01:50:26.570 --> 01:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
government rather than overreach and I
 
01:50:28.609 --> 01:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
understand we have different ideological
 
01:50:31.970 --> 01:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
points of view I think there are times
 
01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:33.830 align:start position:0%
points of view I think there are times
when

01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:50:35.810 --> 01:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
um the governor
 
01:50:38.689 --> 01:50:38.699 align:start position:0%
could have been more
 
01:50:43.810 --> 01:50:43.820 align:start position:0%
forceful in terms of emergency orders to
 
01:50:46.430 --> 01:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
keep the state safe
 
01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:47.450 align:start position:0%
keep the state safe
right

01:50:47.450 --> 01:50:47.460 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:50:50.090 --> 01:50:50.100 align:start position:0%
a specific question that's I'm not sure
 
01:50:52.370 --> 01:50:52.380 align:start position:0%
is Jermaine to the
 
01:50:55.250 --> 01:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
um the specifics of the amendment and
 
01:50:57.290 --> 01:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
the bill but it did get brought up
 
01:50:57.300 --> 01:50:58.609 align:start position:0%
the bill but it did get brought up
initially

01:50:58.609 --> 01:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
initially
 
01:50:58.619 --> 01:50:59.590 align:start position:0%
initially
um

01:50:59.590 --> 01:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
and I think it's maybe part of the
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
subtext of the bill which is the whole
 
01:51:08.090 --> 01:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
issue of the potentially ordering
 
01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:09.709 align:start position:0%
issue of the potentially ordering
vaccines

01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:09.719 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
01:51:12.649 --> 01:51:12.659 align:start position:0%
um creating a mandate for vaccines and I
 
01:51:15.290 --> 01:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
know that representative Marsh you I
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
think in response to a question early on
 
01:51:20.930 --> 01:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
in this hearing talked about the fact
 
01:51:23.330 --> 01:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
if vaccines were mandated which they are
 
01:51:28.490 --> 01:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
clearly not and nobody has talked about
 
01:51:32.090 --> 01:51:32.100 align:start position:0%
wanting to do that as far as I know you
 
01:51:34.010 --> 01:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
said even if that was the case that
 
01:51:36.649 --> 01:51:36.659 align:start position:0%
people would have the right to
 
01:51:36.659 --> 01:51:38.090 align:start position:0%
people would have the right to
um refuse

01:51:38.090 --> 01:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
um refuse
 
01:51:40.490 --> 01:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
but that they would be
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
um somehow they would
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
be obligated to quarantine themselves if
 
01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
that was an order if I'm understanding
 
01:51:50.810 --> 01:51:50.820 align:start position:0%
this correctly they would be obligated
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
to quarantine themselves
 
01:51:55.070 --> 01:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
if that scenario
 
01:51:57.770 --> 01:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
even came up
 
01:52:01.010 --> 01:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
um how would that quarantine be enforced
 
01:52:04.370 --> 01:52:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
may I respond Mr chairman
 
01:52:11.629 --> 01:52:11.639 align:start position:0%
yes as I stated in my testimony under
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
existing law and under the law as it
 
01:52:16.669 --> 01:52:16.679 align:start position:0%
would be amended by this if we do enact
 
01:52:18.649 --> 01:52:18.659 align:start position:0%
it into law the Commissioner of Health
 
01:52:21.649 --> 01:52:21.659 align:start position:0%
and Human Services retains the right to
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
order treatments those treatments
 
01:52:25.310 --> 01:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
include vaccination
 
01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh under existing law we clearly have
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
the statutory language that says that a
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
person has the right to refuse such a
 
01:52:35.149 --> 01:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
treatment however the statutory
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
reference in existing law then directs
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
that person to a Justice of the Peace
 
01:52:42.530 --> 01:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
who shall order the person there's no
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
discretion given to be brought in in the
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
treatment be given so I think it is at
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
least debatable that under existing law
 
01:52:52.970 --> 01:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
the commissioner could in fact mandate
 
01:52:55.010 --> 01:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
vaccines in order whomever she wants to
 
01:52:57.050 --> 01:52:57.060 align:start position:0%
to have that done and there would be
 
01:52:59.090 --> 01:52:59.100 align:start position:0%
very little in the way of recourse that
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
might be found differently in the courts
 
01:53:04.010 --> 01:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
but it's at least confusing if we pass
 
01:53:07.129 --> 01:53:07.139 align:start position:0%
this bill as we have amended it then it
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
is abundantly clear the commissioner
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
retains the ability to order treatments
 
01:53:13.729 --> 01:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
but it clarifies the fact that people
 
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
have the right to refuse treatments and
 
01:53:18.890 --> 01:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
remain in quarantine which if nothing
 
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
else gives the courts decide time to
 
01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:23.820 align:start position:0%
rule on the subject before anything is
 
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
actually done to anyone which I think is
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
a very sensible measure we did not
 
01:53:31.490 --> 01:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
remove the ability of the Commissioner
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services to order
 
01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
treatments in the first place I agree
 
01:53:37.370 --> 01:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
with other people that I think that that
 
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
would be a step too far and interfere
 
01:53:40.609 --> 01:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
with the operations of the department
 
01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
which we do not wish to do so this bill
 
01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
can I can I have a follow-up yes you may
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up I apologize for not
 
01:53:58.010 --> 01:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
giving you that chance representative
 
01:54:00.169 --> 01:54:00.179 align:start position:0%
Shapiro that's okay
 
01:54:03.530 --> 01:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
um I certainly think it makes sense to
 
01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:04.310 align:start position:0%
um I certainly think it makes sense to
um

01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:06.649 --> 01:54:06.659 align:start position:0%
take the contradictions out of the bill
 
01:54:09.169 --> 01:54:09.179 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't make sense to say that
 
01:54:11.689 --> 01:54:11.699 align:start position:0%
um somebody can refuse treatment but
 
01:54:16.370 --> 01:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
then law enforcement in some way can um
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
have them not refuse treatment so I
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
think taking the contradictions in law
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
is out of the bill out of out of law is
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
important but in the scenario you
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
described if someone was to refuse if an
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
order was given
 
01:54:36.410 --> 01:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
for treatment
 
01:54:40.250 --> 01:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
and a citizen refused treatment
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
What would
 
01:54:46.010 --> 01:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
what would the measure to enforce
 
01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
um quarantine be or would there not be
 
01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:50.770 align:start position:0%
um quarantine be or would there not be
any

01:54:50.770 --> 01:54:50.780 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
representative Marshall the measures to
 
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
enforce quarantine are not addressed in
 
01:55:00.109 --> 01:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
this bill in in any way uh honestly I do
 
01:55:01.850 --> 01:55:01.860 align:start position:0%
have a billion uh relative to health
 
01:55:03.470 --> 01:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
officers that's going to Municipal and
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
County government my opinion is that
 
01:55:07.129 --> 01:55:07.139 align:start position:0%
arguably it could have gone to this
 
01:55:08.450 --> 01:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
committee but it's going to Municipal
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
and County government which will involve
 
01:55:13.250 --> 01:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
local Health officers more directly in
 
01:55:15.590 --> 01:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
enforcing quarantine orders and I agree
 
01:55:17.209 --> 01:55:17.219 align:start position:0%
with you that that is a very important
 
01:55:19.250 --> 01:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
issue but it is not a subject of the
 
01:55:21.050 --> 01:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
bill before you right now
 
01:55:23.050 --> 01:55:23.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:55:28.370 --> 01:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
um I think I think
 
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
um my comment probably relates back to
 
01:55:35.930 --> 01:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
representative Snow's question about the
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
composition of the Health and Human
 
01:55:40.729 --> 01:55:40.739 align:start position:0%
Services oversight committee which of
 
01:55:43.070 --> 01:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
course is a whole different issue from
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
the the committee that would be making
 
01:55:47.570 --> 01:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
these decisions uh
 
01:55:50.090 --> 01:55:50.100 align:start position:0%
I was just going to point out that we
 
01:55:51.890 --> 01:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
have any number of committees like
 
01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:55.679 align:start position:0%
jalcar already who have appointed
 
01:55:55.679 --> 01:55:58.430 align:start position:0%
jalcar already who have appointed
specific

01:55:58.430 --> 01:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:56:01.729 --> 01:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
alternates and generally speaking they
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
either go to or monitor all the meetings
 
01:56:06.830 --> 01:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
so that they will be familiar with the
 
01:56:08.890 --> 01:56:08.900 align:start position:0%
actions that have happened in the past
 
01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
and that they will be ready to step in
 
01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
if they need to step in but it's not a
 
01:56:17.209 --> 01:56:17.219 align:start position:0%
New Concept for a number of the
 
01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
Committees that we have
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to clarify that thank
 
01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:23.510 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to clarify that thank
you

01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:56:26.930 --> 01:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:30.109 --> 01:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh thank you for letting me speak
 
01:56:33.169 --> 01:56:33.179 align:start position:0%
I I come at this I'm in support of this
 
01:56:35.149 --> 01:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
bill and and I come at this as a
 
01:56:37.129 --> 01:56:37.139 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a moderate on the issue I I
 
01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
have no problem wearing my mask I'm
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
already set up to get my my vaccine in
 
01:56:44.090 --> 01:56:44.100 align:start position:0%
March uh I generally supported the
 
01:56:46.729 --> 01:56:46.739 align:start position:0%
governor but in this case here it's not
 
01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
a conceptual thing we're working on the
 
01:56:51.590 --> 01:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
the decision to ban hydroxychloroquine
 
01:56:54.290 --> 01:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
was a very questionable act there was a
 
01:56:56.689 --> 01:56:56.699 align:start position:0%
lot of research that that shows that
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
this was working and it and it appeared
 
01:57:03.290 --> 01:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
to be politically motivated and so I
 
01:57:05.810 --> 01:57:05.820 align:start position:0%
think we we definitely need some type of
 
01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
of uh checks and balances from the
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
legislature on decisions like this
 
01:57:11.330 --> 01:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
because we don't know what kind of
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
pressure is being applied to Health and
 
01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
Human Services Department from the
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
federal government or or whatever other
 
01:57:20.030 --> 01:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
entities we need to so we need to be
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
able as a legislature have a say in in
 
01:57:25.609 --> 01:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
big decisions because
 
01:57:27.530 --> 01:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
you know hydrochlorothia may have helped
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
patients who didn't get that help and uh
 
01:57:32.810 --> 01:57:32.820 align:start position:0%
that was a really questionable call so I
 
01:57:35.450 --> 01:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
I hope we can pass this thank you
 
01:57:42.350 --> 01:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
yes this is really just a follow-up to
 
01:57:46.669 --> 01:57:46.679 align:start position:0%
my last question we know seven members
 
01:57:47.689 --> 01:57:47.699 align:start position:0%
of the Health and Human Services
 
01:57:50.570 --> 01:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
oversight committee if four of the
 
01:57:52.609 --> 01:57:52.619 align:start position:0%
regular members at both alternates show
 
01:57:54.770 --> 01:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
up who chooses which of the two
 
01:57:57.290 --> 01:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
alternates will now be the voting member
 
01:58:01.129 --> 01:58:01.139 align:start position:0%
that could lead to some uh criticism if
 
01:58:03.290 --> 01:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
if somebody feels the wrong one was
 
01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:05.209 align:start position:0%
if somebody feels the wrong one was
chosen

01:58:05.209 --> 01:58:05.219 align:start position:0%
chosen
 
01:58:07.490 --> 01:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
you could indeed I believe that would be
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
the choice of the chair the choice of
 
01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
01:58:13.070 --> 01:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:19.850 --> 01:58:19.860 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair did you say
 
01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
representative Woods or
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
I did no thank you uh this is just a
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
sidebar question almost uh was there
 
01:58:29.209 --> 01:58:29.219 align:start position:0%
consideration on the Ethics Committee to
 
01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
have an Ethics a medical ethicist on
 
01:58:34.729 --> 01:58:34.739 align:start position:0%
board not that the the folks identified
 
01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't act ethically but
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
um sometimes another dimension is
 
01:58:43.370 --> 01:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
brought into consideration by a real
 
01:58:46.370 --> 01:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
formal ethicist
 
01:58:48.649 --> 01:58:48.659 align:start position:0%
may I answer that question Mr chairman
 
01:58:48.659 --> 01:58:49.970 align:start position:0%
may I answer that question Mr chairman
yesterday

01:58:49.970 --> 01:58:49.980 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh yes the Department of Health and
 
01:58:54.109 --> 01:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
Human Services did mention that uh but
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
then they informed us that they were not
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
prepared to bring the language forward
 
01:58:59.390 --> 01:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
at this time and that they were
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
perfectly content with bringing that
 
01:59:03.050 --> 01:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
language forward in the Senate and
 
01:59:05.089 --> 01:59:05.099 align:start position:0%
perhaps we will continue to negotiate on
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
the membership of the ethics oversight
 
01:59:08.510 --> 01:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
advisory committee
 
01:59:10.669 --> 01:59:10.679 align:start position:0%
brought that question too because I have
 
01:59:12.169 --> 01:59:12.179 align:start position:0%
taught methods
 
01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
and there are
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
sort of protocols in doing ethics that
 
01:59:20.930 --> 01:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
sometimes coincide with common sense and
 
01:59:22.669 --> 01:59:22.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes don't so I brought that point
 
01:59:26.990 --> 01:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
too uh I would like that in this bill
 
01:59:30.290 --> 01:59:30.300 align:start position:0%
but going forward to looking
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
again at what the Ethics Committee
 
01:59:38.209 --> 01:59:38.219 align:start position:0%
will bring in as experts when they're
 
01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
discussing ethical questions so
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative Woods on tracking with
 
01:59:43.970 --> 01:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
01:59:46.490 --> 01:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
representative merchants
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh I wanted to
 
01:59:51.950 --> 01:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
commend representative Marsh for what
 
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
you're doing one of the things I just
 
01:59:55.010 --> 01:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring the attention to the
 
01:59:55.020 --> 01:59:56.510 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring the attention to the
committee

01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:00:00.290 --> 02:00:00.300 align:start position:0%
when we had the hydroxychloroquine issue
 
02:00:02.689 --> 02:00:02.699 align:start position:0%
one of the unintended consequences that
 
02:00:05.450 --> 02:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
we had was that many patients that were
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
on chronic therapy for rheumatoid
 
02:00:10.250 --> 02:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
arthritis because all of a sudden the
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
supply chain a drug disappeared
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
literally and patients who needed it
 
02:00:18.050 --> 02:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
routinely for the underlying long-term
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
chronic condition we're faced with a
 
02:00:22.189 --> 02:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
consequence was no alternative to it at
 
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
that point in time
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
so representative March I totally
 
02:00:27.950 --> 02:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
support a physician having the ability
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
to prescribe based upon the patient
 
02:00:32.510 --> 02:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
however I do have a concern as a
 
02:00:35.209 --> 02:00:35.219 align:start position:0%
pharmacist about how do we prioritize
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
drug therapy and the availability of
 
02:00:40.189 --> 02:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
those drugs in order to take care of the
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
patients how we prioritize that
 
02:00:43.850 --> 02:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
accordingly because unfortunately one of
 
02:00:45.530 --> 02:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
the ways we dealt with it was the
 
02:00:47.450 --> 02:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
Restriction which then put a halt to it
 
02:00:49.790 --> 02:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm fundamentally okay with
 
02:00:52.129 --> 02:00:52.139 align:start position:0%
prescribing it but how do we help the
 
02:00:53.689 --> 02:00:53.699 align:start position:0%
pharmacist in the community to be sure
 
02:00:55.010 --> 02:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
that patients who are on chronic
 
02:00:56.570 --> 02:00:56.580 align:start position:0%
medications like this
 
02:01:00.530 --> 02:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:02.990 --> 02:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
may I respond yes
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
I think as I made clear in my testimony
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
in this bill what the uh Commissioner of
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services did to
 
02:01:14.750 --> 02:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
prioritize the distribution of
 
02:01:16.729 --> 02:01:16.739 align:start position:0%
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine I
 
02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
think was totally appropriate and was
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
well done uh that being said uh I I
 
02:01:24.169 --> 02:01:24.179 align:start position:0%
think that for her to say that one could
 
02:01:26.209 --> 02:01:26.219 align:start position:0%
not prescribe the drug which would for
 
02:01:28.850 --> 02:01:28.860 align:start position:0%
instance allow a patient to order a drug
 
02:01:30.770 --> 02:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
from a mail order pharmacy out of state
 
02:01:34.370 --> 02:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
uh was inappropriate and overreach
 
02:01:36.530 --> 02:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
because there was never mentioned in
 
02:01:39.050 --> 02:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
this statute the ability to restrict
 
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
prescribing so uh I think we're again
 
02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
trying to walk a very fine line here and
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
we've done our best to thread the needle
 
02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:49.380 --> 02:01:51.410 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:01:53.209 --> 02:01:53.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just want to
 
02:01:55.550 --> 02:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
speak to a concern of one of the
 
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
representatives a little while ago about
 
02:02:00.410 --> 02:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement of quarantine worrying that
 
02:02:02.990 --> 02:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
there was no way to do such but it is
 
02:02:05.570 --> 02:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
already written into statute that they
 
02:02:07.930 --> 02:02:07.940 align:start position:0%
will use the least restrictive means
 
02:02:10.729 --> 02:02:10.739 align:start position:0%
possible and that a person should be
 
02:02:12.050 --> 02:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
able to choose where they have their
 
02:02:14.629 --> 02:02:14.639 align:start position:0%
quarantine but if it is written into RSA
 
02:02:16.810 --> 02:02:16.820 align:start position:0%
141c under Section
 
02:02:21.530 --> 02:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
uh 13. that if anyone refuses to
 
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
cooperate with the quarantine orders the
 
02:02:24.770 --> 02:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
commissioner May issue a complaint
 
02:02:27.229 --> 02:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
that's sworn before justice of the peace
 
02:02:28.609 --> 02:02:28.619 align:start position:0%
and they can give it to any law
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer who then has the
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
ability to take that individual into
 
02:02:34.729 --> 02:02:34.739 align:start position:0%
custody and transport them back to where
 
02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:37.860 align:start position:0%
they were to be quarantined
 
02:02:40.129 --> 02:02:40.139 align:start position:0%
so just to alleviate that concern I
 
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:55.490 --> 02:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
the motion is ought to pass
 
02:03:01.070 --> 02:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
as amended but still 187 amended by 161h
 
02:03:03.530 --> 02:03:03.540 align:start position:0%

02:07:52.729 --> 02:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
not much more for homes
 
02:07:56.510 --> 02:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
the affordability issue is is right of

02:08:45.709 --> 02:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that we should also
 
02:08:47.830 --> 02:08:47.840 align:start position:0%

yes sir Mr chair

um let me just pull it back up here okay
 
02:13:38.270 --> 02:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
this bill will look familiar to those of
 
02:13:39.790 --> 02:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
you who are on the committee last year
 
02:13:42.350 --> 02:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
and I sent out a rather long and
 
02:13:44.810 --> 02:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
detailed information on it to everybody
 
02:13:47.629 --> 02:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
before so you could review the amendment
 
02:13:49.490 --> 02:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
and the bill and try to make sense out
 
02:13:51.050 --> 02:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
of it
 
02:13:53.390 --> 02:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
um one thing that oh sorry for the
 
02:13:55.490 --> 02:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
record I'm representative Jerry Carroll
 
02:13:57.109 --> 02:13:57.119 align:start position:0%

02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
freedom
 
02:14:00.770 --> 02:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
now one thing that covid-19 has taught
 
02:14:02.330 --> 02:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
us this year is the importance of
 
02:14:03.709 --> 02:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
vaccines and the need for their
 
02:14:06.290 --> 02:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
widespread use the vaccines really are
 
02:14:07.729 --> 02:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
one of our most important Public Health
 
02:14:09.410 --> 02:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
tools because they prevent millions of
 
02:14:11.629 --> 02:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
illnesses and same save numerous lives
 
02:14:14.810 --> 02:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
each year what this bill does is to
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
substantially decrease the costs of
 
02:14:20.270 --> 02:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines to our insurers and hopefully
 
02:14:22.609 --> 02:14:22.619 align:start position:0%
increase vaccination rates
 
02:14:25.550 --> 02:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
the bill establishes a public-private
 
02:14:29.089 --> 02:14:29.099 align:start position:0%
partnership between DHHS and the
 
02:14:31.550 --> 02:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
insurers to enable the insurers to
 
02:14:33.770 --> 02:14:33.780 align:start position:0%
access a federal program to purchase
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
adult vaccines at about one half of what
 
02:14:37.609 --> 02:14:37.619 align:start position:0%
they normally pay
 
02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
this Universal purchasing program is in
 
02:14:41.569 --> 02:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
bulk and only available to governmental
 
02:14:43.550 --> 02:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
units not to the insurers individually
 
02:14:45.709 --> 02:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
or the providers individually
 
02:14:48.410 --> 02:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
this program will allow the insurers and
 
02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
therefore ultimately all of us who pay
 
02:14:52.430 --> 02:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
their premiums to save millions in
 
02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine costs
 
02:14:57.069 --> 02:14:57.079 align:start position:0%
all administrative costs to this program
 
02:15:00.290 --> 02:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
are covered as this program is designed
 
02:15:02.750 --> 02:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
by the insurance companies
 
02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
currently there are three other states
 
02:15:06.169 --> 02:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
that do this Alaska Rhode Island and
 
02:15:06.179 --> 02:15:07.669 align:start position:0%
that do this Alaska Rhode Island and
Vermont

02:15:07.669 --> 02:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
Vermont
 
02:15:09.709 --> 02:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
so what this does does is this bill
 
02:15:12.589 --> 02:15:12.599 align:start position:0%
extends to adults the already existing
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
very successful program for purchasing
 
02:15:17.629 --> 02:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
pediatric vaccines in New Hampshire the
 
02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
implementation should be pretty
 
02:15:20.750 --> 02:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
straightforward using in for the
 
02:15:22.010 --> 02:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
existing things we've learned in
 
02:15:23.709 --> 02:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
infrastructure of that pediatric program
 
02:15:26.270 --> 02:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
the Pediatric program was established in
 
02:15:30.350 --> 02:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
2002. the insurers are assessed a fee
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
for each insured pediatric life those
 
02:15:36.290 --> 02:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
funds are then aggregated and sent to
 
02:15:39.470 --> 02:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
DHHS to purchase the vaccines at the
 
02:15:40.970 --> 02:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
significantly discounted federally
 
02:15:43.490 --> 02:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
negotiated vaccine prices
 
02:15:46.970 --> 02:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
in so doing in the Pediatric program the
 
02:15:49.129 --> 02:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
state purchases about 38 million dollars
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
of vaccines for about 28 million dollars
 
02:15:54.770 --> 02:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
a savings of about 10 million or twenty
 
02:15:56.089 --> 02:15:56.099 align:start position:0%
six percent
 
02:15:57.950 --> 02:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
these vaccines are then distributed to
 
02:15:59.629 --> 02:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
the providers free of charge to
 
02:16:01.790 --> 02:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
administer to the patients
 
02:16:03.470 --> 02:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire achieves a very high
 
02:16:06.050 --> 02:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
pediatric vaccine rate with this program
 
02:16:08.270 --> 02:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire vaccine Association is
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
a non-profit corporation that was
 
02:16:12.350 --> 02:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
created to actually just do the job of
 
02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
assessing and collecting the funds from
 
02:16:15.770 --> 02:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
the health insurers
 
02:16:17.689 --> 02:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
so in drafting this bill
 
02:16:20.330 --> 02:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
I use the language of a 126 Q which is
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
the Pediatric Statute in collaboration
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
in collaboration with Beth Daley the
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
chief of the Bureau of Infectious
 
02:16:28.669 --> 02:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
Disease Control and DHHS Patrick Miller
 
02:16:30.410 --> 02:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
the CEO of New Hampshire vaccine
 
02:16:32.629 --> 02:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
Association and Heidi Kroll who
 
02:16:35.410 --> 02:16:35.420 align:start position:0%
represents all of the insurers with ahip
 
02:16:38.509 --> 02:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
this bill amends the existing statute to
 
02:16:42.830 --> 02:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
cover the adults up to age 65. after
 
02:16:45.770 --> 02:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
that Medicaid sorry Medicare Part D B
 
02:16:48.169 --> 02:16:48.179 align:start position:0%
and D cover many vaccines and we really
 
02:16:50.450 --> 02:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
can't tamper with a federal program in
 
02:16:52.129 --> 02:16:52.139 align:start position:0%
terms of its funding
 
02:16:54.169 --> 02:16:54.179 align:start position:0%
all of the vaccines recommended for
 
02:16:56.690 --> 02:16:56.700 align:start position:0%
adults by the CDC would be covered
 
02:16:58.730 --> 02:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
the CDC has already determined those
 
02:17:00.290 --> 02:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
vaccines to be cost effective and
 
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
recommends them and those
 
02:17:03.650 --> 02:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
recommendations were sent to you as well
 
02:17:04.730 --> 02:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
in a link
 
02:17:07.250 --> 02:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines are not specifically
 
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
included in this bill
 
02:17:10.730 --> 02:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
because they're not yet on the CD list
 
02:17:12.830 --> 02:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
in their CDC list and they're currently
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
being provided at no cost by the federal
 
02:17:15.599 --> 02:17:16.910 align:start position:0%
being provided at no cost by the federal
government

02:17:16.910 --> 02:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:17:18.589 --> 02:17:18.599 align:start position:0%
but at some point the federal government
 
02:17:20.570 --> 02:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
will stop providing those vaccines for
 
02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
free and they will likely then be on the
 
02:17:24.169 --> 02:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
CDC list and they would then be covered
 
02:17:26.929 --> 02:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
by this bill as well and indeed
 
02:17:28.490 --> 02:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
depending on the duration of immunity
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
that is achieved by the current coveted
 
02:17:32.450 --> 02:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
vaccines they may become routine
 
02:17:35.089 --> 02:17:35.099 align:start position:0%
boosters done every year and that might
 
02:17:36.530 --> 02:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
really increase the volume of adult
 
02:17:38.990 --> 02:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines that we don't know
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
the key thing is that the recent
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
experience and the covet vaccine rollout
 
02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:45.300 align:start position:0%
has demonstrated great demand for the
 
02:17:45.300 --> 02:17:46.969 align:start position:0%
has demonstrated great demand for the
vaccine

02:17:46.969 --> 02:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
02:17:48.349 --> 02:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
so the New Hampshire insurance
 
02:17:50.509 --> 02:17:50.519 align:start position:0%
department last year for this bill that
 
02:17:51.849 --> 02:17:51.859 align:start position:0%
was when it was called
 
02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
hb1655 they looked at what the uh cost
 
02:17:57.290 --> 02:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis would be to to roll
 
02:17:59.810 --> 02:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
this bill out to adults they use claims
 
02:18:02.330 --> 02:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
data from 2018.
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
they demonstrated that the insurers paid
 
02:18:08.750 --> 02:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
on claims 8.2 million dollars for
 
02:18:10.969 --> 02:18:10.979 align:start position:0%
vaccine material that was a billed
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
amount of 13 and a half million but they
 
02:18:15.410 --> 02:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
paid claims of 8.5 because nobody really
 
02:18:17.629 --> 02:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
covers of course the the build rate
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
and they noted that the CDC contracted
 
02:18:22.370 --> 02:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
prices for State vaccination programs
 
02:18:25.549 --> 02:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
are on average half of that that is paid
 
02:18:27.290 --> 02:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
for the same vaccines and the paid
 
02:18:28.610 --> 02:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
claims data
 
02:18:30.770 --> 02:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
so that demonstrates an expected cost
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
savings to the insurers with this
 
02:18:34.669 --> 02:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
program of about four million dollars
 
02:18:36.950 --> 02:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
for about eight million dollars of
 
02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:38.389 align:start position:0%
for about eight million dollars of
vaccines

02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
02:18:40.490 --> 02:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
since the total administrative costs for
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
the adult portion of the program that's
 
02:18:43.370 --> 02:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
the new portion are four hundred
 
02:18:45.709 --> 02:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and those are fully
 
02:18:47.150 --> 02:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
covered by the assessment of the
 
02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:48.589 align:start position:0%
covered by the assessment of the
insurers

02:18:48.589 --> 02:18:48.599 align:start position:0%
insurers
 
02:18:51.169 --> 02:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
there is no cost to the state for this
 
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
and the insurers invest four hundred
 
02:18:54.830 --> 02:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to realize a four
 
02:18:57.290 --> 02:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
million dollar savings a ten to one
 
02:18:59.570 --> 02:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
return on their investment so really not
 
02:19:02.509 --> 02:19:02.519 align:start position:0%
a bad deal besides that direct Savings
 
02:19:04.310 --> 02:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
of the boat purchasing at a discounted
 
02:19:06.589 --> 02:19:06.599 align:start position:0%
rate the potential also exists that we
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
might increase vaccination rates this
 
02:19:10.610 --> 02:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
would result in further savings from the
 
02:19:11.929 --> 02:19:11.939 align:start position:0%
avoidance of medical costs from
 
02:19:14.270 --> 02:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
complications such as hospitalizations
 
02:19:16.610 --> 02:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
for flu and other diseases
 
02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
now those on the committee last year
 
02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
remember we passed it out of the
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
committee we passed it out a house but
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
it died a coveted death
 
02:19:25.969 --> 02:19:25.979 align:start position:0%
um even though I was encouraged by some
 
02:19:27.530 --> 02:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
people just to put the bill back in as
 
02:19:29.570 --> 02:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
it was every bill can be made better by
 
02:19:31.549 --> 02:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
continuing to work on it so I continued
 
02:19:33.049 --> 02:19:33.059 align:start position:0%
to work on it in the summer in the fall
 
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
and even in the winter here
 
02:19:37.310 --> 02:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
um and finally reached wording which is
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
acceptable to DHHS the medical society
 
02:19:42.370 --> 02:19:42.380 align:start position:0%
new Futures and the insurers
 
02:19:44.509 --> 02:19:44.519 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the work with the insurers
 
02:19:46.129 --> 02:19:46.139 align:start position:0%
was still going on after the bill had
 
02:19:48.349 --> 02:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
been signed off so I did have to provide
 
02:19:51.370 --> 02:19:51.380 align:start position:0%
that Amendment which is
 
02:19:54.170 --> 02:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
20210032h which I have sent to you and
 
02:19:55.849 --> 02:19:55.859 align:start position:0%
that Amendment covers some changes we've
 
02:19:59.330 --> 02:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
made to satisfy some concerns of theirs
 
02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
so basically as far as the language a
 
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
lot of times you'll just see the phrase
 
02:20:06.050 --> 02:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
and adults added because that rolls it
 
02:20:08.030 --> 02:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
out there are a few things that are a
 
02:20:09.590 --> 02:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
little bit different and there's one I'm
 
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
going to point out a few that are
 
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
different from last year if you turn to
 
02:20:15.530 --> 02:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
page one lines 10 to 12.
 
02:20:18.170 --> 02:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
so that is different than last year
 
02:20:20.690 --> 02:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
the current language and statute has to
 
02:20:22.310 --> 02:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
do with calculating the medical loss
 
02:20:23.690 --> 02:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
ratio which is the percentage of
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
premiums used for health care not for
 
02:20:28.070 --> 02:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
overhead but that language is superseded
 
02:20:30.650 --> 02:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
by the ACA when that was pointed out
 
02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
last year we just removed the language
 
02:20:33.530 --> 02:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
because we felt it was really not
 
02:20:33.540 --> 02:20:34.670 align:start position:0%
because we felt it was really not
necessary

02:20:34.670 --> 02:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:20:36.590 --> 02:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
however given concerns about the
 
02:20:38.690 --> 02:20:38.700 align:start position:0%
potential repeal of the ACA by the
 
02:20:40.969 --> 02:20:40.979 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court we opted to put that
 
02:20:42.830 --> 02:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
language back in with the introductory
 
02:20:44.990 --> 02:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
phrase that it is in effect and less
 
02:20:46.969 --> 02:20:46.979 align:start position:0%
preempted by federal law
 
02:20:49.070 --> 02:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
there's another spot that we had to put
 
02:20:50.690 --> 02:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
that language in and that's on page two
 
02:20:53.090 --> 02:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
lines 27 to 30. again all those details
 
02:20:54.590 --> 02:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
are in the written testimony I sent to
 
02:20:56.330 --> 02:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
you earlier
 
02:20:59.210 --> 02:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
um they're page one line 17 to 20 just
 
02:21:01.849 --> 02:21:01.859 align:start position:0%
makes it really clear that the dhh costs
 
02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
of administering the program are
 
02:21:05.510 --> 02:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
included in the assessment to the
 
02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
insurers so that the costs of DHHS are
 
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
covered fully the reason that's
 
02:21:12.110 --> 02:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
important is a little bit of a kind of
 
02:21:14.090 --> 02:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
sloppy wording when it was passed in
 
02:21:17.150 --> 02:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
2002 for the Pediatric program said
 
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
Administration and that was interpreted
 
02:21:22.490 --> 02:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
to just mean the actual administration
 
02:21:25.190 --> 02:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
of a vaccine by a provider and so this
 
02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
corrects that
 
02:21:29.389 --> 02:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
in 2020 there were concerns raised about
 
02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
the liability risk to the state for any
 
02:21:34.070 --> 02:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
adverse vaccine reactions proposed by
 
02:21:36.469 --> 02:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
particularly two vaccines the the
 
02:21:38.929 --> 02:21:38.939 align:start position:0%
polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine and
 
02:21:40.670 --> 02:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
the disaster vaccine because they're not
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
including the vaccine injury
 
02:21:44.210 --> 02:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
Compensation Program that covers
 
02:21:46.490 --> 02:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccines our solution last
 
02:21:48.349 --> 02:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
year was to exclude those two
 
02:21:50.090 --> 02:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
now the risk of liability for the state
 
02:21:51.770 --> 02:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
is really vanishingly small is they're
 
02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
really only a purchasing agent they're
 
02:21:55.309 --> 02:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
they're basically helping the purchase
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
and The Taking of adult vaccines
 
02:22:00.830 --> 02:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
currently and in this program is
 
02:22:02.950 --> 02:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
voluntary with informed consent obtained
 
02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
given the importance of the two vaccines
 
02:22:07.190 --> 02:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
particularly pneumococcal vaccine during
 
02:22:07.200 --> 02:22:08.510 align:start position:0%
particularly pneumococcal vaccine during
covid

02:22:08.510 --> 02:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
covid
 
02:22:10.969 --> 02:22:10.979 align:start position:0%
in preventing costly hospitalization and
 
02:22:13.130 --> 02:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
death we felt that our better solution
 
02:22:15.429 --> 02:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
was to continue to cover all the CDC
 
02:22:18.530 --> 02:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
recommended vaccines and we inserted
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
language removing liability from the
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
state that is that language is already
 
02:22:25.250 --> 02:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
in statute for the New Hampshire vaccine
 
02:22:27.650 --> 02:22:27.660 align:start position:0%
Association that language is on page
 
02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
three lines 11 to 14. so that just
 
02:22:32.090 --> 02:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
simply mirrors these the statutory
 
02:22:36.650 --> 02:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
protection of nhva only for the state
 
02:22:38.990 --> 02:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
on page three line 17 to 20 again
 
02:22:40.969 --> 02:22:40.979 align:start position:0%
reinforced that the vaccine fund raised
 
02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
from the assessment covers the
 
02:22:45.170 --> 02:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
administrative costs if you turn to the
 
02:22:47.889 --> 02:22:47.899 align:start position:0%
amendment again 202
 
02:22:49.849 --> 02:22:49.859 align:start position:0%
10032 h
 
02:22:52.490 --> 02:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
it makes the following changes on page
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
one line 17 another spot I just happened
 
02:22:58.250 --> 02:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
to miss the word adults and adds that in
 
02:23:00.770 --> 02:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
page one line 28
 
02:23:02.570 --> 02:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
this is on the amendment I'm referring
 
02:23:04.250 --> 02:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
to the amendment numbers here page one
 
02:23:06.050 --> 02:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
line 28 of the amendment to page two
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
line five sets a cap on the DHHS program
 
02:23:13.070 --> 02:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
costs subject to adjustment for
 
02:23:16.309 --> 02:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
inflation and program volume
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
there was no cap before
 
02:23:21.230 --> 02:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
now you may notice here that the costs
 
02:23:25.849 --> 02:23:25.859 align:start position:0%
suddenly say 400 sorry 848 000 whereas
 
02:23:29.929 --> 02:23:29.939 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note it says 364.
 
02:23:32.090 --> 02:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
the reason for that difference is this
 
02:23:36.650 --> 02:23:36.660 align:start position:0%
represents the total DHHS costs for both
 
02:23:39.830 --> 02:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
the Pediatric program and the adult
 
02:23:42.170 --> 02:23:42.180 align:start position:0%
program in other words this corrects
 
02:23:43.610 --> 02:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
that little bit of a glitch that didn't
 
02:23:46.309 --> 02:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
allow DHHS to put its costs into the
 
02:23:48.170 --> 02:23:48.180 align:start position:0%
assessment in the original pediatric
 
02:23:50.570 --> 02:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
bill it shifts their administrative
 
02:23:52.429 --> 02:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
costs for the Pediatric program to the
 
02:23:55.309 --> 02:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
insurers who again are comfortable with
 
02:23:56.929 --> 02:23:56.939 align:start position:0%
this language
 
02:23:58.730 --> 02:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
it's actually a fairly small amount but
 
02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
nevertheless page two on the amendment
 
02:24:05.570 --> 02:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
page two lines 11 through 14 are added
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
to ensure transparent accounting of the
 
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
DHHS program costs
 
02:24:12.469 --> 02:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
all this is publicly available
 
02:24:12.479 --> 02:24:13.910 align:start position:0%
all this is publicly available
information

02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:24:17.210 --> 02:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
but uh it is buried away in various
 
02:24:18.830 --> 02:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
minutes and so on in the you know I'm
 
02:24:21.410 --> 02:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
sure vaccine Association and they wish
 
02:24:23.389 --> 02:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
to have it quite clearly identified it's
 
02:24:25.730 --> 02:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
a two-page report that is released and
 
02:24:26.990 --> 02:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
on their website under their annual
 
02:24:29.750 --> 02:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
report and so this would be clarified as
 
02:24:31.309 --> 02:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
far as what the costs are the New
 
02:24:32.809 --> 02:24:32.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine Association already
 
02:24:35.270 --> 02:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
puts in their costs but this would also
 
02:24:37.849 --> 02:24:37.859 align:start position:0%
clarify the dhh costs
 
02:24:41.150 --> 02:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
now there's another issue on page two
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
again on the amendment page two line
 
02:24:46.190 --> 02:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
17-22 that just ensures protection for
 
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
the insurers that they won't be billed
 
02:24:50.690 --> 02:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
by providers for a vaccine
 
02:24:52.670 --> 02:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
for which they've already paid in the
 
02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:53.809 align:start position:0%
for which they've already paid in the
assessment

02:24:53.809 --> 02:24:53.819 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:24:57.050 --> 02:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
and then the last thing page two line 23
 
02:25:00.290 --> 02:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
set the effective date as upon its
 
02:25:00.300 --> 02:25:01.550 align:start position:0%
set the effective date as upon its
Passage

02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
Passage
 
02:25:04.670 --> 02:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
this is to enable DHHS and nhva to start
 
02:25:06.170 --> 02:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
working to set up the program which will
 
02:25:07.910 --> 02:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
take time to implement
 
02:25:10.130 --> 02:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
we did discuss this last year we pushed
 
02:25:11.570 --> 02:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
it way out because we were thinking
 
02:25:13.309 --> 02:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
about having it when the program is up
 
02:25:14.389 --> 02:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
and running
 
02:25:15.650 --> 02:25:15.660 align:start position:0%
but what we really need with the
 
02:25:17.630 --> 02:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
effective date is allowing the work to
 
02:25:20.090 --> 02:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
begin at its passage there will be a
 
02:25:21.770 --> 02:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
certain sequence there's a sequence to
 
02:25:24.469 --> 02:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
the assessment and and the processing of
 
02:25:26.270 --> 02:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
the funds and getting it back that will
 
02:25:28.370 --> 02:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
ensure that this won't really be running
 
02:25:30.770 --> 02:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
for a couple of years probably but they
 
02:25:32.450 --> 02:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
need the authority to move
 
02:25:35.389 --> 02:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
an analogy on that is the therapeutic
 
02:25:38.690 --> 02:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
cannabis law it was passed in 2013 with
 
02:25:41.210 --> 02:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
the phrase upon passage it's effective
 
02:25:43.010 --> 02:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
but we know that that program wasn't
 
02:25:44.950 --> 02:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
really finally fully functional until
 
02:25:47.750 --> 02:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
2016. so this does not imply that
 
02:25:49.550 --> 02:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
immediately this is all going to be
 
02:25:52.010 --> 02:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
happening it gives the authority
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
again if we look at the fiscal note on
 
02:25:55.610 --> 02:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
the original bill it's important to
 
02:25:57.889 --> 02:25:57.899 align:start position:0%
realize that 100 percent of the DHHS
 
02:26:00.349 --> 02:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
administrative costs of this program are
 
02:26:02.750 --> 02:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
returned to dhhs's revenue through the
 
02:26:04.370 --> 02:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
vaccine fund raised by the insurance
 
02:26:07.969 --> 02:26:07.979 align:start position:0%
assessment it is completely budget
 
02:26:07.979 --> 02:26:09.349 align:start position:0%
assessment it is completely budget
neutral

02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
02:26:11.690 --> 02:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
all funds assessed in year preceding the
 
02:26:13.849 --> 02:26:13.859 align:start position:0%
purchase of the vaccines I'm sorry as
 
02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
the funds are pres are assessed in the
 
02:26:18.230 --> 02:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
year preceding the purchase the assessed
 
02:26:20.270 --> 02:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
funds will be available through the New
 
02:26:23.210 --> 02:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine Association to DHHS to
 
02:26:27.950 --> 02:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
cover the program startup costs in uh in
 
02:26:30.530 --> 02:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
the um Amendment on page two lines three
 
02:26:32.990 --> 02:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
to five we gave authority or ability of
 
02:26:35.929 --> 02:26:35.939 align:start position:0%
the nhva to assess the startup cost to
 
02:26:38.330 --> 02:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
it to kind of add a little bit if needed
 
02:26:39.710 --> 02:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
for the first year or two as the program
 
02:26:41.389 --> 02:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
gets off the ground
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
so in summary the citizens of New
 
02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are already realizing Savings
 
02:26:48.770 --> 02:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
of about 10 million dollars in vaccine
 
02:26:51.290 --> 02:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
costs per year from the Pediatric
 
02:26:51.300 --> 02:26:52.370 align:start position:0%
costs per year from the Pediatric
program

02:26:52.370 --> 02:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:26:55.190 --> 02:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
if we extend it to adults that will lead
 
02:26:56.990 --> 02:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
to about another four million dollars in
 
02:26:59.210 --> 02:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
savings to the citizens of New Hampshire
 
02:27:01.550 --> 02:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
and that's to our insurance companies
 
02:27:05.510 --> 02:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
but through them with uh saving them
 
02:27:07.250 --> 02:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
money that'll hopefully save us money in
 
02:27:09.770 --> 02:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
our premiums and of course a much
 
02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
greater number of amount of savings than
 
02:27:14.750 --> 02:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
four million dollars if the in the
 
02:27:18.110 --> 02:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
future the covet uh issues drive more
 
02:27:19.969 --> 02:27:19.979 align:start position:0%
vaccine uptake either because of covet
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
itself are people having a better
 
02:27:24.410 --> 02:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
awareness as to vaccines
 
02:27:26.090 --> 02:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
I want to take a moment which this is
 
02:27:28.370 --> 02:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
not what I sent to you before but we all
 
02:27:29.929 --> 02:27:29.939 align:start position:0%
got a bunch of emails in the last 24
 
02:27:29.939 --> 02:27:31.130 align:start position:0%
got a bunch of emails in the last 24
hours

02:27:31.130 --> 02:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
hours
 
02:27:32.570 --> 02:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
some of them make some statements that
 
02:27:34.550 --> 02:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
are simply not correct so I will just
 
02:27:36.650 --> 02:27:36.660 align:start position:0%
quickly address those again this bill
 
02:27:38.450 --> 02:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
adds nothing to the budget the amendment
 
02:27:40.670 --> 02:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
does not increase administrative costs
 
02:27:42.410 --> 02:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
and it actually
 
02:27:45.650 --> 02:27:45.660 align:start position:0%
decreases the cost to the state because
 
02:27:48.530 --> 02:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
it shifts some of those dhh costs to the
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
Pediatric program which their current
 
02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
which DHHS currently has to pay shifts
 
02:27:55.849 --> 02:27:55.859 align:start position:0%
that to the insurers it makes them
 
02:27:58.130 --> 02:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
clearer and it caps them
 
02:27:59.630 --> 02:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
there was a comment made that the
 
02:28:01.670 --> 02:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
administrative costs of DHHS can just be
 
02:28:03.050 --> 02:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
increased whenever they want but that's
 
02:28:05.330 --> 02:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
not correct there are caps it's covered
 
02:28:08.809 --> 02:28:08.819 align:start position:0%
it's um controlled
 
02:28:10.490 --> 02:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
and it was also a concern that it
 
02:28:13.070 --> 02:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover age 65 but again I do not
 
02:28:14.990 --> 02:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
think that we as a state can tamper with
 
02:28:17.809 --> 02:28:17.819 align:start position:0%
Federal program reimbursements that is
 
02:28:19.849 --> 02:28:19.859 align:start position:0%
those vaccines uh many of them are
 
02:28:23.090 --> 02:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
covered under uh Medicaid D for the
 
02:28:25.070 --> 02:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
actual vaccine and the vaccines are
 
02:28:28.370 --> 02:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
covered as in Part B as well this bill
 
02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
does not interfere with your vaccine
 
02:28:31.910 --> 02:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
choices vaccination continues to be
 
02:28:34.570 --> 02:28:34.580 align:start position:0%
voluntary this just makes it cheaper
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
concerns about New Hampshire vaccine
 
02:28:41.330 --> 02:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
Association the insurers summarized as
 
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
the best they were quite pleased with
 
02:28:45.770 --> 02:28:45.780 align:start position:0%
the financial stewardship of nhva which
 
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
has actually decreased their
 
02:28:49.429 --> 02:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
administrative costs over years
 
02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
and there are also concerns about
 
02:28:52.730 --> 02:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
oversight event vaccine inventories
 
02:28:54.770 --> 02:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
there is very robust oversight that's
 
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
the major source of the administrative
 
02:28:59.410 --> 02:28:59.420 align:start position:0%
costs and Dr Daley can discuss that uh
 
02:29:03.230 --> 02:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
the uh there was also a concern that a
 
02:29:04.910 --> 02:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
scripture rights for damages rated to
 
02:29:06.650 --> 02:29:06.660 align:start position:0%
vaccines not true but only protects the
 
02:29:08.330 --> 02:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
um if you wish to sue a provider you
 
02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
still have that same right and then
 
02:29:15.650 --> 02:29:15.660 align:start position:0%
lastly that that's it's some kind of
 
02:29:17.570 --> 02:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
thing that's going to be damaging and
 
02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
can't be done three other states
 
02:29:22.190 --> 02:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
successfully run such programs
 
02:29:24.830 --> 02:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
so that's all I have for statements for
 
02:29:30.530 --> 02:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:33.290 --> 02:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
02:29:33.300 --> 02:29:34.849 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
chairman

02:29:34.849 --> 02:29:34.859 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:29:37.690 --> 02:29:37.700 align:start position:0%
um what is the federal program that
 
02:29:41.210 --> 02:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
DHHS uses to purchase vaccines
 
02:29:42.830 --> 02:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
is that the vaccines for children
 
02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:44.750 align:start position:0%
is that the vaccines for children
program

02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:29:46.969 --> 02:29:46.979 align:start position:0%
actually I'm going to let Dr Daley go
 
02:29:48.530 --> 02:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
over that because the mechanics of how
 
02:29:51.050 --> 02:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
that part works is much more in her
 
02:29:51.060 --> 02:29:52.130 align:start position:0%
that part works is much more in her
field

02:29:52.130 --> 02:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
field
 
02:29:52.140 --> 02:29:53.750 align:start position:0%
field
okay

02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:30:01.490 --> 02:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:04.370 --> 02:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
daily sent now it would probably answer
 
02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
a number of questions that we could
 
02:30:09.170 --> 02:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
anticipate but if not then I'll come
 
02:30:10.370 --> 02:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
back to you
 
02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:24.889 --> 02:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
okay good morning everyone hopefully I'm
 
02:30:27.650 --> 02:30:27.660 align:start position:0%
off of mute now can you hear me okay
 
02:30:27.660 --> 02:30:28.790 align:start position:0%
off of mute now can you hear me okay
yep

02:30:28.790 --> 02:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:30:30.290 --> 02:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
great well thank you so much
 
02:30:31.910 --> 02:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson and members of
 
02:30:34.250 --> 02:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Beth Daly chief of the
 
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Infectious Disease Control at
 
02:30:37.429 --> 02:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of Health
 
02:30:40.190 --> 02:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and I'm here today to
 
02:30:43.550 --> 02:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
provide information on House Bill 604 I
 
02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
want to thank representative knurk for
 
02:30:47.150 --> 02:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
bringing forward this bill in support of
 
02:30:49.429 --> 02:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
vaccinations to protect and improve the
 
02:30:51.710 --> 02:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
health of our communities you all know
 
02:30:53.389 --> 02:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
the benefits of immunization it's
 
02:30:54.830 --> 02:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
considered one of the greatest Public
 
02:30:56.809 --> 02:30:56.819 align:start position:0%
Health achievements of the last century
 
02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
and increasing access for adults
 
02:31:01.790 --> 02:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
specifically is important because our
 
02:31:04.610 --> 02:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
immunity from some vaccines received as
 
02:31:07.610 --> 02:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
a child wanes over time and because some
 
02:31:09.710 --> 02:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
adults are at increased risk for severe
 
02:31:11.450 --> 02:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
infections due to chronic medical
 
02:31:14.090 --> 02:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
conditions which are increasing as our
 
02:31:16.370 --> 02:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
population gets older and those chronic
 
02:31:18.830 --> 02:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
illnesses become more common
 
02:31:21.469 --> 02:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
additionally vaccinating adults protects
 
02:31:23.809 --> 02:31:23.819 align:start position:0%
the people around them who may be
 
02:31:25.550 --> 02:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
especially vulnerable to infectious
 
02:31:28.250 --> 02:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
diseases and can't be vaccinated
 
02:31:30.770 --> 02:31:30.780 align:start position:0%
themselves such as small babies who
 
02:31:32.570 --> 02:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
aren't able to get the pertussis vaccine
 
02:31:34.849 --> 02:31:34.859 align:start position:0%
pertussis or whooping cough and they can
 
02:31:37.610 --> 02:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
actually go on to die due to that
 
02:31:40.010 --> 02:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
infection so vaccinating those adults
 
02:31:41.870 --> 02:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
around a baby will help protect that
 
02:31:44.690 --> 02:31:44.700 align:start position:0%
baby as well so we have some of the
 
02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
highest childhood immunization rates in
 
02:31:49.670 --> 02:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
our country in the country however our
 
02:31:52.130 --> 02:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
adult coverage is much lower and we
 
02:31:53.630 --> 02:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
continue to see vaccine preventable
 
02:31:56.030 --> 02:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
diseases that result in preventable
 
02:31:59.210 --> 02:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations in adults in I'm sorry
 
02:32:01.490 --> 02:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
hospitalations and deaths in adults so
 
02:32:03.170 --> 02:32:03.180 align:start position:0%
during my 16 years here at the
 
02:32:05.389 --> 02:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
department we've had an adult die from
 
02:32:08.030 --> 02:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
Chickenpox a newborn baby die from
 
02:32:09.889 --> 02:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
whooping cough after Contracting that
 
02:32:11.630 --> 02:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
illness from their unvaccinated parent
 
02:32:14.330 --> 02:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
and then we recently experienced a very
 
02:32:17.150 --> 02:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
large outbreak of hepatitis A which is
 
02:32:19.370 --> 02:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
also a vaccine preventable disease with
 
02:32:23.270 --> 02:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
over 300 cases 200 hospitalizations and
 
02:32:25.730 --> 02:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
two adults who died from that very
 
02:32:28.370 --> 02:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
preventable illness so just to bring
 
02:32:30.050 --> 02:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
home those
 
02:32:31.969 --> 02:32:31.979 align:start position:0%
public health benefits not to mention
 
02:32:34.250 --> 02:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
influenza which you probably know there
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
are you know 50 or so adults who die
 
02:32:38.929 --> 02:32:38.939 align:start position:0%
from influenza
 
02:32:41.630 --> 02:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
every year in our state not to mention
 
02:32:43.790 --> 02:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
all the people who die from pneumonia
 
02:32:46.309 --> 02:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
which is probably due to influenza as
 
02:32:46.319 --> 02:32:47.150 align:start position:0%
which is probably due to influenza as
well

02:32:47.150 --> 02:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:32:49.849 --> 02:32:49.859 align:start position:0%
uh currently the CDC Advisory committee
 
02:32:52.250 --> 02:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
on immunization practices recommends
 
02:32:54.830 --> 02:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
immunization against as many as 15
 
02:32:56.929 --> 02:32:56.939 align:start position:0%
different infectious diseases during
 
02:32:59.270 --> 02:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
adulthood and this really depends on
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
your age and any special risk factors
 
02:33:03.530 --> 02:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
you have we want all adults to get their
 
02:33:06.230 --> 02:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccine every year as well as
 
02:33:09.530 --> 02:33:09.540 align:start position:0%
their tetanus diphtheria and acellular
 
02:33:11.870 --> 02:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
pertussis vaccine every 10 years or
 
02:33:13.490 --> 02:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
sooner and then you heard about that
 
02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
important pneumococcal vaccine that
 
02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative canner talked about
 
02:33:20.150 --> 02:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
so now I'm just going to switch gears to
 
02:33:23.150 --> 02:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
talk about financing in terms of how we
 
02:33:25.610 --> 02:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
pay for vaccines in the state we have
 
02:33:27.230 --> 02:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
that Federal vaccines for children
 
02:33:30.290 --> 02:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
program this provides vaccine to all
 
02:33:32.929 --> 02:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
children who are on Medicaid uninsured
 
02:33:35.090 --> 02:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
or underinsured or who are American
 
02:33:37.670 --> 02:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
Indian or Alaskan native the way that we
 
02:33:39.770 --> 02:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
purchase vaccines for the rest of the
 
02:33:42.050 --> 02:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
children because that vfc eligible group
 
02:33:44.450 --> 02:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
is about 40 percent the remaining 60
 
02:33:46.610 --> 02:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
percent are purchased through our
 
02:33:48.410 --> 02:33:48.420 align:start position:0%
partnership with the New Hampshire
 
02:33:50.929 --> 02:33:50.939 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association and is paid for by
 
02:33:52.190 --> 02:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
the payers
 
02:33:54.830 --> 02:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
we consider our state then a universal
 
02:33:56.570 --> 02:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
purchasing program for children which
 
02:33:58.130 --> 02:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
means that we purchase all of the
 
02:33:59.630 --> 02:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
vaccines in the state
 
02:34:02.270 --> 02:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
four children off of that CDC contract
 
02:34:05.450 --> 02:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
which allows us to save those funds
 
02:34:09.290 --> 02:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
so this bill is creating a or proposes
 
02:34:10.910 --> 02:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
to create a universal purchase program
 
02:34:14.929 --> 02:34:14.939 align:start position:0%
likewise for adults under the age of 65.
 
02:34:17.510 --> 02:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
there are 10 states in our country who
 
02:34:19.309 --> 02:34:19.319 align:start position:0%
have those Universal purchase programs
 
02:34:21.230 --> 02:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
for children and there are the three
 
02:34:23.450 --> 02:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
states Alaska Rhode Island and Vermont
 
02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
that have Universal purchase programs
 
02:34:30.710 --> 02:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
for adults in terms of how we oversee
 
02:34:33.290 --> 02:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
these programs obviously we have very
 
02:34:34.670 --> 02:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
strict standards from the federal
 
02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
government around operation of our
 
02:34:38.809 --> 02:34:38.819 align:start position:0%
Childhood Program this includes
 
02:34:40.910 --> 02:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
oversight of all of the vaccines that
 
02:34:43.309 --> 02:34:43.319 align:start position:0%
are purchased through our program we
 
02:34:45.190 --> 02:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
oversee the shipping and administration
 
02:34:47.990 --> 02:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
of every vaccine dose that's purchased
 
02:34:50.330 --> 02:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
by DHHS it's tracked in our vaccine
 
02:34:52.849 --> 02:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
ordering management system and we have a
 
02:34:54.650 --> 02:34:54.660 align:start position:0%
very robust quality assurance and
 
02:34:56.570 --> 02:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
accountability program so any health
 
02:34:59.450 --> 02:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
care provider who is receiving doses of
 
02:35:01.190 --> 02:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine through this program
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
must sign agreements and meet very
 
02:35:05.150 --> 02:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
strict requirements for accountability
 
02:35:07.790 --> 02:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
of the vaccines they receive this
 
02:35:09.469 --> 02:35:09.479 align:start position:0%
includes implementing the required
 
02:35:11.270 --> 02:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine storage and handling practices
 
02:35:13.070 --> 02:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have any loss of those
 
02:35:14.990 --> 02:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines maintaining emergency
 
02:35:17.210 --> 02:35:17.220 align:start position:0%
procedures to prevent loss of vaccine
 
02:35:19.730 --> 02:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
during power failures and making sure
 
02:35:21.650 --> 02:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
that there's that accountability for
 
02:35:23.870 --> 02:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
every dose of vaccine we provide
 
02:35:25.130 --> 02:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
training to them and technical
 
02:35:27.710 --> 02:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
assistance and we also visit every
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
location that has our vaccines on site
 
02:35:33.410 --> 02:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
at least once every two years to assure
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
their compliance with our program
 
02:35:37.730 --> 02:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures
 
02:35:39.770 --> 02:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
so these oversight and monitoring
 
02:35:42.050 --> 02:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
activities along with the care taken by
 
02:35:43.790 --> 02:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
our health care providers and handling
 
02:35:45.889 --> 02:35:45.899 align:start position:0%
the vaccines has led to New Hampshire's
 
02:35:48.110 --> 02:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
exceedingly low vaccine wastage rate
 
02:35:50.809 --> 02:35:50.819 align:start position:0%
it's less than one percent which is well
 
02:35:53.210 --> 02:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
below cdc's goal for State immunization
 
02:35:56.650 --> 02:35:56.660 align:start position:0%
programs which is five percent
 
02:36:00.050 --> 02:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
so with the new adult program that's
 
02:36:01.910 --> 02:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
being proposed we assume that we would
 
02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
have to enroll about 350 to 400
 
02:36:06.670 --> 02:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
additional provider office locations
 
02:36:09.110 --> 02:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
this is above and beyond the Childhood
 
02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
Program and so in order to implement
 
02:36:14.270 --> 02:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
that oversight of their vaccine ordering
 
02:36:16.910 --> 02:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
safety and accountability we have
 
02:36:18.650 --> 02:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
assumed that we'd need to hire those
 
02:36:20.330 --> 02:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
four positions that have been outlined
 
02:36:21.830 --> 02:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal room
 
02:36:25.370 --> 02:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
uh so in conclusion DHHS are the
 
02:36:27.170 --> 02:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
insurers Health Care Providers and the
 
02:36:28.849 --> 02:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association have all been able
 
02:36:30.770 --> 02:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
to work in Partnership to successfully
 
02:36:32.690 --> 02:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
offer vaccines to all children in our
 
02:36:35.030 --> 02:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
state and as a result we enjoy High
 
02:36:37.010 --> 02:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
immunization rates and low rates of
 
02:36:39.530 --> 02:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
vaccine preventable diseases an adult
 
02:36:41.210 --> 02:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
program that's modeled after that
 
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
Childhood Program is feasible and would
 
02:36:45.170 --> 02:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
offer public health benefits of
 
02:36:46.910 --> 02:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
increasing access to vaccines and
 
02:36:49.010 --> 02:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
decreasing infectious diseases that
 
02:36:51.469 --> 02:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
would also offer the cost savings that
 
02:36:54.530 --> 02:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
representative canark outlined for us
 
02:36:55.670 --> 02:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
um so thank you very much for the
 
02:36:57.469 --> 02:36:57.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify and I'd be happy
 
02:36:59.929 --> 02:36:59.939 align:start position:0%
to address any questions you have thank
 
02:36:59.939 --> 02:37:02.090 align:start position:0%
to address any questions you have thank
you

02:37:02.090 --> 02:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:37:06.590 --> 02:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:08.570 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:37:08.570 --> 02:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes representative Merchants
 
02:37:15.230 --> 02:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for taking Mike
 
02:37:17.929 --> 02:37:17.939 align:start position:0%
but thank you for that Mr chairman and
 
02:37:17.939 --> 02:37:19.370 align:start position:0%
but thank you for that Mr chairman and
also

02:37:19.370 --> 02:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:37:22.190 --> 02:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
Bethany for taking my question
 
02:37:23.990 --> 02:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
um this is more probably in the details
 
02:37:27.290 --> 02:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
in the weeds but as a pharmacist today
 
02:37:30.230 --> 02:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
when we bill for the vaccine we also
 
02:37:32.450 --> 02:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
bill for the administration of the
 
02:37:34.490 --> 02:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
vaccine and so forth
 
02:37:37.309 --> 02:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
um it's sort of dovetails together
 
02:37:39.650 --> 02:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
my question to you or someone else maybe
 
02:37:41.389 --> 02:37:41.399 align:start position:0%
in the insurance industry
 
02:37:44.210 --> 02:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
if I don't have a vaccine to bill for am
 
02:37:46.010 --> 02:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
I going to be able to bill for just the
 
02:37:48.110 --> 02:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
administration of the vaccine is that
 
02:37:49.250 --> 02:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
going to go to the insurance company
 
02:37:51.290 --> 02:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
under the drug benefit or go to the
 
02:37:52.370 --> 02:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
insurance company under the medical
 
02:37:52.380 --> 02:37:54.410 align:start position:0%
insurance company under the medical
benefit

02:37:54.410 --> 02:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
02:37:57.349 --> 02:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
so I can start by answering to say that
 
02:37:59.870 --> 02:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
you can bill you in fact you do Bill
 
02:38:01.969 --> 02:38:01.979 align:start position:0%
separately for the vaccine dose itself
 
02:38:04.370 --> 02:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
and the administration fee so under the
 
02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
Childhood Program those providers who
 
02:38:08.570 --> 02:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
are administering the vaccine they do
 
02:38:11.510 --> 02:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
not bill for the dose itself because we
 
02:38:13.370 --> 02:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
have already purchased that for them and
 
02:38:15.590 --> 02:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
the payers have provided the funding for
 
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
that they do charge the administration
 
02:38:21.110 --> 02:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
fee and that will get covered by the
 
02:38:23.570 --> 02:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
insurance company then or the insurer I
 
02:38:25.190 --> 02:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to the more
 
02:38:26.690 --> 02:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
detailed billing side of that because I
 
02:38:30.770 --> 02:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:34.010 --> 02:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
thank you I
 
02:38:36.170 --> 02:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
could we have someone
 
02:38:38.030 --> 02:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
um do some research because my concern
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
is that we get into a billing issue
 
02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:40.790 align:start position:0%
is that we get into a billing issue
where

02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:38:43.010 --> 02:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
all intent we want to
 
02:38:45.830 --> 02:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
expand if you will the vaccinations for
 
02:38:47.809 --> 02:38:47.819 align:start position:0%
adults which I totally support I just
 
02:38:49.370 --> 02:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
don't want to have a situation where all
 
02:38:52.070 --> 02:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
of a sudden the pharmacy we don't have a
 
02:38:54.349 --> 02:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
billing mechanism to accommodate the
 
02:38:56.750 --> 02:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
expansion of the program today we don't
 
02:38:58.490 --> 02:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
deal with that with children because the
 
02:38:59.690 --> 02:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
most part we don't build for children
 
02:39:01.790 --> 02:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines per se because it's not really
 
02:39:04.190 --> 02:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
part of our scope of practice
 
02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
those we expand this to adults I think
 
02:39:10.910 --> 02:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:14.750 --> 02:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
so just to reaffirm you can bill for the
 
02:39:16.190 --> 02:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
administration fee I just didn't
 
02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
understand the second half of your
 
02:39:18.770 --> 02:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
question which maybe the insurance
 
02:39:20.990 --> 02:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
department is on and can answer or an
 
02:39:23.690 --> 02:39:23.700 align:start position:0%
insurer what what I understand is that
 
02:39:25.550 --> 02:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
when you build for the vaccine for the
 
02:39:27.530 --> 02:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
product itself at that time you also
 
02:39:28.969 --> 02:39:28.979 align:start position:0%
bill for the administration of the
 
02:39:31.969 --> 02:39:31.979 align:start position:0%
vaccine if we don't bill for the vaccine
 
02:39:34.910 --> 02:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
itself my concern is a mechanism to
 
02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
build only for the labor and not for the
 
02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:37.610 align:start position:0%
build only for the labor and not for the
product

02:39:37.610 --> 02:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
product
 
02:39:37.620 --> 02:39:39.830 align:start position:0%
product
there

02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:39:41.809 --> 02:39:41.819 align:start position:0%
but you can
 
02:39:44.750 --> 02:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
and I heard representative
 
02:39:48.290 --> 02:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:50.450 --> 02:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
am I allowed to speak I'm sorry I didn't
 
02:39:51.770 --> 02:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
realize I wasn't muted I was just
 
02:39:54.710 --> 02:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
whispering to myself yes you are you are
 
02:39:57.710 --> 02:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to to char to bill for the
 
02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
administration the provider can bill for
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
the administration of the vaccine that's
 
02:40:03.170 --> 02:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
currently there it would still be there
 
02:40:05.389 --> 02:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
it's not precluded
 
02:40:07.429 --> 02:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
if I may miss the chair not to get into
 
02:40:10.730 --> 02:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
a discussion with um president but I
 
02:40:12.530 --> 02:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
just take it offline but my concern is
 
02:40:14.330 --> 02:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
that that's in the medical side I'm just
 
02:40:15.530 --> 02:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
concerned a lot of things in a pharmacy
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
on the drug side which operates
 
02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
differently than the medical side
 
02:40:21.910 --> 02:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
we're about to hold this uh for the
 
02:40:23.990 --> 02:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
exact session
 
02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:25.510 align:start position:0%
exact session
please

02:40:25.510 --> 02:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:40:30.770 --> 02:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:34.010 --> 02:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman my question is
 
02:40:37.730 --> 02:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
I got emails from a couple of members of
 
02:40:40.190 --> 02:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
the public who were against this bill
 
02:40:41.450 --> 02:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
because they thought it was going to
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
require them to be vaccinated even if
 
02:40:44.990 --> 02:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to and I could find
 
02:40:46.790 --> 02:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
nothing and I don't believe that has
 
02:40:50.150 --> 02:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
anything to do with this bill does it
 
02:40:53.870 --> 02:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think so thank you
 
02:40:56.210 --> 02:40:56.220 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
 
02:40:56.220 --> 02:40:57.710 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman thank you Mr
chairman

02:40:57.710 --> 02:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:41:00.710 --> 02:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
um Dr Daly
 
02:41:03.530 --> 02:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
these DHHS administrative costs does
 
02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
that include is that all staff and
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
programs or does that also include new
 
02:41:15.290 --> 02:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:17.750 --> 02:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
so the cost for the adult program our
 
02:41:22.250 --> 02:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
new staff who we need to go do that to
 
02:41:24.230 --> 02:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
assist with the vaccine ordering and go
 
02:41:26.330 --> 02:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
out into those provider offices and make
 
02:41:28.550 --> 02:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
sure that they are following
 
02:41:30.770 --> 02:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
um the all the policies and procedures
 
02:41:34.670 --> 02:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:39.349 --> 02:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
so follow-up so then none of this money
 
02:41:42.110 --> 02:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
that you anticipate to be needing to
 
02:41:45.230 --> 02:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
spend is going to go toward bolstering
 
02:41:48.710 --> 02:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
or expanding or at all going toward the
 
02:41:50.510 --> 02:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire immunization information
 
02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:52.010 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire immunization information
system

02:41:52.010 --> 02:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
so remember that the immunization
 
02:41:56.389 --> 02:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
information system does two things one
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
part of it is a registry the other part
 
02:42:01.309 --> 02:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
is the vaccine ordering system so in
 
02:42:03.050 --> 02:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
order to run this program we have to
 
02:42:05.510 --> 02:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
have a in Information Technology
 
02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
solution to order vaccines for those
 
02:42:12.230 --> 02:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
provider offices so it might be possible
 
02:42:13.790 --> 02:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
that we might need funding to support
 
02:42:15.530 --> 02:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
the ordering aspect but it would not
 
02:42:18.230 --> 02:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
support the registry component of the
 
02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:19.730 align:start position:0%
support the registry component of the
system

02:42:19.730 --> 02:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:42:21.530 --> 02:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
what we have presented in the fiscal
 
02:42:23.210 --> 02:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
note is the new costs that are
 
02:42:26.030 --> 02:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
associated with the adult program
 
02:42:28.429 --> 02:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
and we have asked the vaccine
 
02:42:30.110 --> 02:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
Association to support our vaccine
 
02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
ordering system
 
02:42:34.190 --> 02:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
in the past but that has not been
 
02:42:36.290 --> 02:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
approved because it was not allowable by
 
02:42:38.929 --> 02:42:38.939 align:start position:0%
under statute
 
02:42:41.990 --> 02:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for Dr
 
02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:50.210 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for Dr
Daley

02:42:50.210 --> 02:42:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:54.830 --> 02:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
being none of the chair calls Dr J J
 
02:42:56.750 --> 02:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
Smith from the New Hampshire Public
 
02:43:03.830 --> 02:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:06.170 --> 02:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
let's see there we go says I can now be
 
02:43:08.929 --> 02:43:08.939 align:start position:0%
unmuted great hi
 
02:43:11.630 --> 02:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
um I am fully in support of this bill
 
02:43:14.150 --> 02:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
SSR Association we're very happy to see
 
02:43:16.610 --> 02:43:16.620 align:start position:0%
this and actually my only reason for
 
02:43:19.429 --> 02:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
being here is to iterate support and we
 
02:43:20.990 --> 02:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
did send a letter
 
02:43:24.650 --> 02:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
um did a bunch of uh research on the
 
02:43:26.809 --> 02:43:26.819 align:start position:0%
part of one of our members of our policy
 
02:43:29.809 --> 02:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
committee and my main purpose is just to
 
02:43:32.030 --> 02:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
be here in case anyone wants to speak to
 
02:43:34.130 --> 02:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
someone who is a primary care physician
 
02:43:36.950 --> 02:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
or was I I guess I am retired
 
02:43:38.750 --> 02:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
um I've been doing advocacy for about
 
02:43:40.490 --> 02:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
five years now
 
02:43:43.250 --> 02:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
um after retirement but I have a lot of
 
02:43:46.969 --> 02:43:46.979 align:start position:0%
knowledge of vaccines in both my uh
 
02:43:50.270 --> 02:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
clinical capacity and as a healthcare a
 
02:43:52.849 --> 02:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
public health person so I I really have
 
02:43:54.830 --> 02:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
nothing more to add to all of the
 
02:43:57.830 --> 02:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
wonderful stuff that Dr knurk has said
 
02:43:59.630 --> 02:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
um but I do realize that despite your
 
02:44:01.250 --> 02:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
having medical expertise on the
 
02:44:02.809 --> 02:44:02.819 align:start position:0%
committee you don't have Primary Care
 
02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
people on the committee that I know of
 
02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:06.950 align:start position:0%
people on the committee that I know of
yeah

02:44:06.950 --> 02:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:44:12.590 --> 02:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:14.510 --> 02:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none the chair calls Holly
 
02:44:23.410 --> 02:44:23.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:27.050 --> 02:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
all right are you guys able to hear me
 
02:44:27.060 --> 02:44:29.750 align:start position:0%
all right are you guys able to hear me
yes

02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:31.969 --> 02:44:31.979 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
02:44:34.130 --> 02:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
new Futures appreciates the opportunity
 
02:44:37.210 --> 02:44:37.220 align:start position:0%
to testify in support of House Bill 604
 
02:44:40.010 --> 02:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
relative to expanding
 
02:44:42.889 --> 02:44:42.899 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire vaccine Association to
 
02:44:45.410 --> 02:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
include adult vaccines and just for the
 
02:44:47.330 --> 02:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
record my name is Holly Stevens I'm the
 
02:44:50.210 --> 02:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
health policy coordinator at new futures
 
02:44:53.090 --> 02:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
new Futures is a non-partisan non-profit
 
02:44:56.090 --> 02:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
organization that Advocates educates and
 
02:44:58.130 --> 02:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
collaborates to improve the health and
 
02:45:01.010 --> 02:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
wellness of New Hampshire residents in
 
02:45:02.750 --> 02:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
this role we work extensively with
 
02:45:05.330 --> 02:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
policy makers Health Care Providers and
 
02:45:07.910 --> 02:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
families to improve overall public
 
02:45:10.370 --> 02:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
health and improve health Equity across
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
the granite state
 
02:45:15.110 --> 02:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill 604 is a great step in moving
 
02:45:17.270 --> 02:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire's and moving New
 
02:45:19.070 --> 02:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Public Health needle in the
 
02:45:20.830 --> 02:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
right direction
 
02:45:23.570 --> 02:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
expanding the state's vaccine program to
 
02:45:26.210 --> 02:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
include adults will save money while
 
02:45:28.730 --> 02:45:28.740 align:start position:0%
making CDC approved vaccines available
 
02:45:31.150 --> 02:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
to all adults in New Hampshire
 
02:45:34.510 --> 02:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of insurance type or status
 
02:45:36.950 --> 02:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
and I did just want to hit home that
 
02:45:39.230 --> 02:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
point that this program will also
 
02:45:42.770 --> 02:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
include individuals who are uninsured
 
02:45:44.929 --> 02:45:44.939 align:start position:0%
and individuals who are underinsured
 
02:45:47.809 --> 02:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
meaning they have a plan that does not
 
02:45:47.819 --> 02:45:48.849 align:start position:0%
meaning they have a plan that does not
require

02:45:48.849 --> 02:45:48.859 align:start position:0%
require
 
02:45:51.889 --> 02:45:51.899 align:start position:0%
it to have the
 
02:45:55.570 --> 02:45:55.580 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the AC ACA to
 
02:45:58.969 --> 02:45:58.979 align:start position:0%
include all preventable
 
02:46:02.990 --> 02:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
preventive medicine costs so anybody who
 
02:46:05.870 --> 02:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
has a catastrophic plan or things like
 
02:46:07.370 --> 02:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
that they would also be able to get
 
02:46:11.870 --> 02:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:14.090 --> 02:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
um as you heard representative Canucks
 
02:46:17.030 --> 02:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
say that this bill if it was were to
 
02:46:19.490 --> 02:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
pass would join only three other states
 
02:46:22.809 --> 02:46:22.819 align:start position:0%
that have Universal vaccine programs
 
02:46:26.090 --> 02:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
and also just to really Hammer this
 
02:46:29.210 --> 02:46:29.220 align:start position:0%
point home while it does make these
 
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines available to all adults 18 to
 
02:46:35.710 --> 02:46:35.720 align:start position:0%
64. it in no way
 
02:46:38.929 --> 02:46:38.939 align:start position:0%
mandates adults to receive any
 
02:46:41.809 --> 02:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
vaccination on the adult vaccine program
 
02:46:45.770 --> 02:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:48.770 --> 02:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
I also did want to uh just point out too
 
02:46:50.929 --> 02:46:50.939 align:start position:0%
that I did some research
 
02:46:52.730 --> 02:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
um there's very limited research about
 
02:46:54.710 --> 02:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
whether a universal vaccine program
 
02:46:56.809 --> 02:46:56.819 align:start position:0%
would increase
 
02:46:59.750 --> 02:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
um the uptick of individuals becoming
 
02:47:01.429 --> 02:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
vaccinated but I did want to let the
 
02:47:04.790 --> 02:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
committee know that in 2018 to 2019
 
02:47:07.010 --> 02:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island which is one of the states
 
02:47:09.889 --> 02:47:09.899 align:start position:0%
that has a universal vaccine program
 
02:47:12.349 --> 02:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
they were number one in the country for
 
02:47:14.990 --> 02:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
adults receiving flu vaccines and again
 
02:47:16.370 --> 02:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out point out
 
02:47:19.130 --> 02:47:19.140 align:start position:0%
that's a correlation it doesn't mean
 
02:47:21.230 --> 02:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
that one caused the other it's just
 
02:47:23.690 --> 02:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
water for For Thought
 
02:47:23.700 --> 02:47:24.969 align:start position:0%
water for For Thought
um

02:47:24.969 --> 02:47:24.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:28.309 --> 02:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
and although this bill wasn't it was
 
02:47:29.990 --> 02:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
introduced originally in advance of
 
02:47:31.790 --> 02:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
covet 19.
 
02:47:33.410 --> 02:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
um because of the pandemic it was left
 
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
on the table as you know
 
02:47:39.230 --> 02:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
um the covid-19 virus has not affected
 
02:47:42.050 --> 02:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
all populations in our state equally
 
02:47:45.110 --> 02:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
offering no-cost vaccinations to all
 
02:47:47.570 --> 02:47:47.580 align:start position:0%
adults will help improve racial Health
 
02:47:49.550 --> 02:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
disparities for historically
 
02:47:52.190 --> 02:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
marginalized populations and will assist
 
02:47:54.590 --> 02:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
in improving the Health and Wellness
 
02:47:57.290 --> 02:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
of all Granite Staters now and into the
 
02:47:57.300 --> 02:47:59.870 align:start position:0%
of all Granite Staters now and into the
future

02:47:59.870 --> 02:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:01.910 --> 02:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
and also as representative connect
 
02:48:04.250 --> 02:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned in his testimony
 
02:48:06.710 --> 02:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
um last fall
 
02:48:08.450 --> 02:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire vaccine Association
 
02:48:10.910 --> 02:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Public Health and I
 
02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
just want to say thank you if if uh Dr
 
02:48:15.950 --> 02:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
Daley is still on this call she actually
 
02:48:17.750 --> 02:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
did provide
 
02:48:19.429 --> 02:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
um I would say a significant amount of
 
02:48:21.410 --> 02:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
her time given what's going on right now
 
02:48:22.730 --> 02:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
02:48:24.530 --> 02:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
um to this endeavor
 
02:48:26.750 --> 02:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
um but the Department of Public Health
 
02:48:28.790 --> 02:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative canark and new Futures
 
02:48:31.610 --> 02:48:31.620 align:start position:0%
and the insurers virtually met a few
 
02:48:33.290 --> 02:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
times to discuss the language of this
 
02:48:35.870 --> 02:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
bill and the amendment that
 
02:48:40.870 --> 02:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:44.389 --> 02:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
2021-0032h was the language that all of
 
02:48:46.849 --> 02:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
us were able to come together and agree
 
02:48:46.859 --> 02:48:48.530 align:start position:0%
us were able to come together and agree
upon

02:48:48.530 --> 02:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
upon
 
02:48:50.990 --> 02:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
um it ensures that the insurers cannot
 
02:48:52.969 --> 02:48:52.979 align:start position:0%
be what they thought might be double
 
02:48:55.849 --> 02:48:55.859 align:start position:0%
billing but it also ensures that
 
02:48:58.849 --> 02:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
patients cannot be charged for that That
 
02:49:01.550 --> 02:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine either regardless of where they
 
02:49:06.670 --> 02:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
obtain it so it ensures that the
 
02:49:09.710 --> 02:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
insurers can't pay for it twice but it
 
02:49:11.809 --> 02:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
also there's language in there that
 
02:49:15.410 --> 02:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
ensures that that cost can't be
 
02:49:17.330 --> 02:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
um passed on to the patient in the way
 
02:49:21.110 --> 02:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
of getting paid twice either
 
02:49:23.510 --> 02:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
um it also has
 
02:49:27.050 --> 02:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
administrative cost controls that were
 
02:49:29.510 --> 02:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
requested by the insurers so that the
 
02:49:31.849 --> 02:49:31.859 align:start position:0%
department couldn't just raise
 
02:49:33.950 --> 02:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
administrative costs willy-nilly to
 
02:49:36.410 --> 02:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
cover other things as they as they
 
02:49:38.929 --> 02:49:38.939 align:start position:0%
wanted to and I'm not in any way saying
 
02:49:41.630 --> 02:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
that they would or that they do it's
 
02:49:43.610 --> 02:49:43.620 align:start position:0%
just a protection so that something like
 
02:49:46.190 --> 02:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
that could not happen
 
02:49:48.110 --> 02:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
um and it also
 
02:49:52.849 --> 02:49:52.859 align:start position:0%
um has transparency requirements so that
 
02:49:55.190 --> 02:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
um all of us can ensure that the program
 
02:49:56.990 --> 02:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
is functioning the way it's designed to
 
02:50:00.889 --> 02:50:00.899 align:start position:0%
which essentially is allowing adults to
 
02:50:05.030 --> 02:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
obtain vaccines at no cost to them and
 
02:50:07.490 --> 02:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
that the insurers are receiving a
 
02:50:10.610 --> 02:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:13.849 --> 02:50:13.859 align:start position:0%
the expansion of the state's vaccine
 
02:50:16.070 --> 02:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
program is cost neutral to the state
 
02:50:18.830 --> 02:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
because the assessment collected as has
 
02:50:21.590 --> 02:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
been mentioned a couple of times comes
 
02:50:23.389 --> 02:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
from the insurers to cover both the
 
02:50:26.389 --> 02:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
vaccines and the administrative costs of
 
02:50:28.690 --> 02:50:28.700 align:start position:0%
the program
 
02:50:33.170 --> 02:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
House Bill 604 as amended is a bill that
 
02:50:36.830 --> 02:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
truly is a win-win for all involved
 
02:50:39.530 --> 02:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
even if the expanded vaccine program in
 
02:50:42.590 --> 02:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 pandemic experience don't
 
02:50:45.170 --> 02:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
result in more adults getting vaccinated
 
02:50:48.349 --> 02:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
it will still cost the insurers less
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
than they are currently paying now for
 
02:50:53.929 --> 02:50:53.939 align:start position:0%
their covered adults who do choose to
 
02:50:55.450 --> 02:50:55.460 align:start position:0%
obtain vaccines
 
02:50:58.070 --> 02:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
and lastly if there's anything that the
 
02:51:01.730 --> 02:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
covid-19 pandemic has taught us is the
 
02:51:04.010 --> 02:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
importance of vaccines in preventing
 
02:51:05.389 --> 02:51:05.399 align:start position:0%
illness and death
 
02:51:07.610 --> 02:51:07.620 align:start position:0%
and so for all of those reasons new
 
02:51:10.429 --> 02:51:10.439 align:start position:0%
future strongly urges the court excuse
 
02:51:12.650 --> 02:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
me the general court in this committee
 
02:51:16.550 --> 02:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
to vote ought to pass as amended on
 
02:51:20.090 --> 02:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
House Bill 604 thank you and I would be
 
02:51:21.590 --> 02:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
able to answer any questions if anybody
 
02:51:23.150 --> 02:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
has any
 
02:51:26.590 --> 02:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Stevens any questions
 
02:51:30.469 --> 02:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative gay thank you thank
 
02:51:32.929 --> 02:51:32.939 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh thank you for taking
 
02:51:34.750 --> 02:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
my questions it's extremely simple
 
02:51:37.070 --> 02:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
you've talked about you know everybody
 
02:51:40.309 --> 02:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
talks about the two costs one is of the
 
02:51:42.290 --> 02:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
vaccine uh
 
02:51:44.330 --> 02:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
liquid itself and the other's
 
02:51:44.340 --> 02:51:46.910 align:start position:0%
liquid itself and the other's
Administration

02:51:46.910 --> 02:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
02:51:49.309 --> 02:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
I heard multiple times that patients
 
02:51:51.950 --> 02:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
won't pay at all for their adult
 
02:51:51.960 --> 02:51:53.690 align:start position:0%
won't pay at all for their adult
immunizations

02:51:53.690 --> 02:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
immunizations
 
02:51:57.110 --> 02:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
so then who pays for the administration
 
02:51:59.690 --> 02:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
the administrative cost that's the cost
 
02:52:01.790 --> 02:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
of actually putting the needle into the
 
02:52:05.630 --> 02:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
skin and pushing the plunger is a cost
 
02:52:09.650 --> 02:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
that is billed to the insurers
 
02:52:12.170 --> 02:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
now one thing that I would like to make
 
02:52:14.030 --> 02:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
clear is somebody who doesn't have
 
02:52:17.030 --> 02:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
insurance unless a provider is willing
 
02:52:18.590 --> 02:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
to waive that cost like if somebody
 
02:52:20.990 --> 02:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
walked into their local pharmacy didn't
 
02:52:23.570 --> 02:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
have insurance and said I want the the
 
02:52:25.670 --> 02:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
flu vaccination
 
02:52:27.710 --> 02:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
um the pharmacy might say well we charge
 
02:52:29.630 --> 02:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
x amount of dollars to actually push
 
02:52:32.330 --> 02:52:32.340 align:start position:0%
that medicine into your skin that being
 
02:52:36.170 --> 02:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
said the state already has a list of
 
02:52:39.710 --> 02:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
providers that will provide vaccines
 
02:52:43.550 --> 02:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
that are purchased by the state
 
02:52:43.560 --> 02:52:44.809 align:start position:0%
that are purchased by the state
um

02:52:44.809 --> 02:52:44.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:47.570 --> 02:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
and they are given to
 
02:52:50.269 --> 02:52:50.279 align:start position:0%
um folks without insurance
 
02:52:53.330 --> 02:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
um at no charge anyway so there are
 
02:52:55.849 --> 02:52:55.859 align:start position:0%
still places that somebody without uh
 
02:52:58.190 --> 02:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
insurance if the uh
 
02:53:01.250 --> 02:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
if the pharmacies weren't willing to say
 
02:53:04.730 --> 02:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
take that cost on themselves that they
 
02:53:07.550 --> 02:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
would be able to go to another provider
 
02:53:10.730 --> 02:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
and receive that vaccination for free
 
02:53:13.309 --> 02:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
um which wouldn't cost them a dime not
 
02:53:15.950 --> 02:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
for the administrative cost and not for
 
02:53:20.510 --> 02:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:22.610 --> 02:53:22.620 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
02:53:22.620 --> 02:53:24.230 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
Cushman

02:53:24.230 --> 02:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
Cushman
 
02:53:26.210 --> 02:53:26.220 align:start position:0%
so if uh
 
02:53:29.809 --> 02:53:29.819 align:start position:0%
if if a patient is uninsured and if a
 
02:53:31.910 --> 02:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
physician's office you know sees
 
02:53:34.670 --> 02:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
uninsured patients do they have to
 
02:53:37.790 --> 02:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
purchase a separate inventory that
 
02:53:40.550 --> 02:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
for those uninsured patients
 
02:53:44.269 --> 02:53:44.279 align:start position:0%
that isn't covered by this no I mean and
 
02:53:47.090 --> 02:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
I if if Dr Daley is still on the school
 
02:53:48.650 --> 02:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
and she wants to correct to me it's my
 
02:53:51.950 --> 02:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
understanding that say I I do have
 
02:53:53.750 --> 02:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
insurance but say I didn't and I walked
 
02:53:57.290 --> 02:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
into a convenient MD
 
02:54:00.530 --> 02:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
um that and I said I want the flu
 
02:54:02.750 --> 02:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine that they might say to me well
 
02:54:04.610 --> 02:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
the vaccine itself is going to be
 
02:54:06.769 --> 02:54:06.779 align:start position:0%
offered to you at no charge it's free we
 
02:54:08.510 --> 02:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
get it for free but we're going to
 
02:54:10.010 --> 02:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
charge you five bucks to put the needle
 
02:54:11.450 --> 02:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
in your arm
 
02:54:14.150 --> 02:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
so the the
 
02:54:16.790 --> 02:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
all of the entities that have the
 
02:54:19.130 --> 02:54:19.140 align:start position:0%
vaccine they get it for free so they
 
02:54:20.570 --> 02:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
absolutely should not be charging
 
02:54:23.210 --> 02:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
anybody for That vaccine whether they
 
02:54:24.650 --> 02:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
have insurance or whether they don't
 
02:54:26.750 --> 02:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
have insurance
 
02:54:29.450 --> 02:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:54:32.150 --> 02:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
is anyone are any providers able to opt
 
02:54:34.490 --> 02:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
out of this program and then the added
 
02:54:37.429 --> 02:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
oversight and regulations that come with
 
02:54:37.439 --> 02:54:39.429 align:start position:0%
oversight and regulations that come with
it

02:54:39.429 --> 02:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:54:44.510 --> 02:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
I've I is can anybody tell me if they
 
02:54:48.769 --> 02:54:48.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:53.170 --> 02:54:53.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:56.750 --> 02:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
she still is on okay
 
02:54:59.809 --> 02:54:59.819 align:start position:0%
um I if it's okay representative if it's
 
02:55:01.969 --> 02:55:01.979 align:start position:0%
okay I'd rather leave that question to
 
02:55:04.190 --> 02:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
her since she's involved in the state
 
02:55:05.630 --> 02:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
and the contract with the state with
 
02:55:08.210 --> 02:55:08.220 align:start position:0%
these providers Dr Daley could you
 
02:55:13.670 --> 02:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:16.250 --> 02:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
yes so thank you for the question and
 
02:55:18.070 --> 02:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to answer it
 
02:55:21.290 --> 02:55:21.300 align:start position:0%
the program is voluntary from the
 
02:55:23.889 --> 02:55:23.899 align:start position:0%
perspective of the health care provider
 
02:55:26.269 --> 02:55:26.279 align:start position:0%
they don't do not have to administer
 
02:55:28.010 --> 02:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
vaccines to the patients they're going
 
02:55:30.889 --> 02:55:30.899 align:start position:0%
to want to do that though and they are
 
02:55:32.570 --> 02:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
already should be doing
 
02:55:34.910 --> 02:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
um managing their vaccine inventory in
 
02:55:36.830 --> 02:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
the way that we
 
02:55:38.690 --> 02:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
um will train them and ensure that
 
02:55:42.110 --> 02:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
they're actually doing can I clarify
 
02:55:44.210 --> 02:55:44.220 align:start position:0%
I was trying to ask
 
02:55:46.190 --> 02:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
um yes representative equipment wishes
 
02:55:48.410 --> 02:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
to clarify her question my question is
 
02:55:50.570 --> 02:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
can they purchase vaccines outside of
 
02:55:52.370 --> 02:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
the program if they don't want to be a
 
02:55:54.050 --> 02:55:54.060 align:start position:0%
part of this program but they still want
 
02:55:56.090 --> 02:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
to purchase vaccines to administer to
 
02:55:57.610 --> 02:55:57.620 align:start position:0%
their patients
 
02:56:00.530 --> 02:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
do they have the option to do
 
02:56:02.570 --> 02:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
so yes they can still purchase those
 
02:56:04.670 --> 02:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines at the higher cost on the
 
02:56:06.530 --> 02:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
private marker Market I'm not sure why
 
02:56:08.929 --> 02:56:08.939 align:start position:0%
they uh would want to do that but they
 
02:56:10.550 --> 02:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
can do that the problem is is that
 
02:56:12.170 --> 02:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be able to Bill
 
02:56:14.570 --> 02:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
insurance for it though they can build
 
02:56:16.130 --> 02:56:16.140 align:start position:0%
that administration fee but they will
 
02:56:17.030 --> 02:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
not be able to bill the insurance
 
02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
company for the um for the cost of the
 
02:56:23.090 --> 02:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
vaccine because those insurers are
 
02:56:25.370 --> 02:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
already contributing into the to
 
02:56:27.230 --> 02:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
purchase That vaccine at the lower cost
 
02:56:29.690 --> 02:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
it's based on the number of insured
 
02:56:32.269 --> 02:56:32.279 align:start position:0%
individuals they have and so they're
 
02:56:33.650 --> 02:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
already paying for the vaccine and
 
02:56:34.730 --> 02:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
they're not going to reimburse that
 
02:56:36.469 --> 02:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
provider who chooses to buy it off the
 
02:56:40.790 --> 02:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:48.230 --> 02:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:51.110 --> 02:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you and the chair
 
02:56:53.809 --> 02:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
recognizes Tyler Brennan from the
 
02:57:04.250 --> 02:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:06.410 --> 02:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
hello uh Tyler Brannan from the New
 
02:57:08.269 --> 02:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Sheriff's Department I am the
 
02:57:10.610 --> 02:57:10.620 align:start position:0%
director of Health economics we do not
 
02:57:13.370 --> 02:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
have a position on the bill and um as
 
02:57:15.950 --> 02:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
was mentioned earlier uh in in response
 
02:57:18.410 --> 02:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
to legislation last year we did an
 
02:57:21.290 --> 02:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
analysis of our claims data on vaccine
 
02:57:23.990 --> 02:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
use in New Hampshire and the prices and
 
02:57:25.309 --> 02:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
there has been background on that
 
02:57:28.130 --> 02:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
already just to say a little about the
 
02:57:28.140 --> 02:57:29.210 align:start position:0%
already just to say a little about the
chis

02:57:29.210 --> 02:57:29.220 align:start position:0%
chis
 
02:57:30.349 --> 02:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
um this is the New Hampshire
 
02:57:32.929 --> 02:57:32.939 align:start position:0%
Comprehensive Health Information System
 
02:57:36.290 --> 02:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
which is basically a claims data set of
 
02:57:38.570 --> 02:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
anonymous Health Care claims that we get
 
02:57:40.969 --> 02:57:40.979 align:start position:0%
from Health insurers
 
02:57:43.849 --> 02:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
um it is not all of the data on all of
 
02:57:46.130 --> 02:57:46.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents but it is a
 
02:57:48.889 --> 02:57:48.899 align:start position:0%
really good sample so that's relevant I
 
02:57:50.750 --> 02:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
think because of some of the comments
 
02:57:53.630 --> 02:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
I've seen around the analysis but um but
 
02:57:55.849 --> 02:57:55.859 align:start position:0%
the analysis in the report our public
 
02:57:57.710 --> 02:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
information they're available on the
 
02:57:59.929 --> 02:57:59.939 align:start position:0%
insurance department website I will send
 
02:58:01.849 --> 02:58:01.859 align:start position:0%
a link to the report to committee
 
02:58:03.710 --> 02:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
members so that you have that at your
 
02:58:03.720 --> 02:58:05.269 align:start position:0%
members so that you have that at your
disposal

02:58:05.269 --> 02:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
disposal
 
02:58:07.429 --> 02:58:07.439 align:start position:0%
um because we don't regulate all of the
 
02:58:10.010 --> 02:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
entities we can't collect data on all of
 
02:58:12.830 --> 02:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents so if somebody
 
02:58:15.349 --> 02:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
is under a self-funded employer in other
 
02:58:17.330 --> 02:58:17.340 align:start position:0%
words the employer retains the risk for
 
02:58:20.630 --> 02:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
the actual Administration claims but a
 
02:58:22.370 --> 02:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
company like Anthem is paying a health
 
02:58:24.469 --> 02:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
care provider we wouldn't necessarily
 
02:58:27.290 --> 02:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
see those claims data So within the
 
02:58:30.530 --> 02:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
database they're in the report it is
 
02:58:32.150 --> 02:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that they're about 13.5
 
02:58:35.269 --> 02:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
million in vaccine that was billed in
 
02:58:38.809 --> 02:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
2018 with about 8.2 million that was
 
02:58:40.190 --> 02:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
actually paid out according to this
 
02:58:42.950 --> 02:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
negotiated prices the report also does
 
02:58:46.070 --> 02:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
say that the CDC contracted rate would
 
02:58:49.070 --> 02:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
be about half of that amount what I want
 
02:58:51.230 --> 02:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
to be clear about is that 8.2 million
 
02:58:53.510 --> 02:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
does not represent the vaccines for all
 
02:58:55.730 --> 02:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire residents within the
 
02:58:58.090 --> 02:58:58.100 align:start position:0%
report there is also an analysis of
 
02:59:00.290 --> 02:59:00.300 align:start position:0%
approximation of how many people we have
 
02:59:02.330 --> 02:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
in the claims data versus how many
 
02:59:04.130 --> 02:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
people there are in New Hampshire and
 
02:59:06.889 --> 02:59:06.899 align:start position:0%
it's a about half so if you wanted to
 
02:59:08.269 --> 02:59:08.279 align:start position:0%
get a kind of a better understanding of
 
02:59:10.730 --> 02:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
the total amount spent on on vaccines in
 
02:59:12.349 --> 02:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you'd probably be going
 
02:59:13.849 --> 02:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
down the road doubling those numbers
 
02:59:16.610 --> 02:59:16.620 align:start position:0%
quite a bit so um some of the findings
 
02:59:18.889 --> 02:59:18.899 align:start position:0%
in the report are that about half of
 
02:59:22.130 --> 02:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
adults have received a vaccine almost 80
 
02:59:24.349 --> 02:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
percent of the people in the 55 to 64
 
02:59:27.530 --> 02:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
age group have received a vaccine by far
 
02:59:29.809 --> 02:59:29.819 align:start position:0%
the most common is for the flu and
 
02:59:31.849 --> 02:59:31.859 align:start position:0%
that's about 70 percent of vaccines
 
02:59:34.730 --> 02:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
being administered 87 percent of the
 
02:59:36.830 --> 02:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines are just for the top three so
 
02:59:38.990 --> 02:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
in addition to the flu this is the
 
02:59:41.150 --> 02:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine for for tetanus diphtheria and
 
02:59:44.389 --> 02:59:44.399 align:start position:0%
pertussis and ninety percent of the time
 
02:59:46.849 --> 02:59:46.859 align:start position:0%
the vaccine was was obtained in a
 
02:59:49.429 --> 02:59:49.439 align:start position:0%
provider office or a pharmacy
 
02:59:51.889 --> 02:59:51.899 align:start position:0%
uh we have reviewed the amendment and we
 
02:59:53.870 --> 02:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
also agree with the very important
 
02:59:56.030 --> 02:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
conclusion that our insurers do not get
 
02:59:58.309 --> 02:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
assessed and billed for the vaccine so
 
03:00:00.170 --> 03:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
that's our understanding of how this
 
03:00:01.730 --> 03:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
would work
 
03:00:03.170 --> 03:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
um representative Merchant raised the
 
03:00:04.550 --> 03:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
question about billing for an
 
03:00:06.889 --> 03:00:06.899 align:start position:0%
administration fee uh without actually
 
03:00:09.349 --> 03:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
billing for a vaccine and our
 
03:00:11.210 --> 03:00:11.220 align:start position:0%
expectation is that carriers would
 
03:00:13.190 --> 03:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
continue to pay that administrative fee
 
03:00:15.710 --> 03:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
they may ask a provider to do something
 
03:00:18.050 --> 03:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
to to clarify that the administration is
 
03:00:19.670 --> 03:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
for a vaccine that's Covenant of the
 
03:00:21.769 --> 03:00:21.779 align:start position:0%
program but that's something that can be
 
03:00:23.389 --> 03:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
worked out I think between the provider
 
03:00:25.910 --> 03:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the insurer we did an analysis of
 
03:00:28.550 --> 03:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
the vaccine data several years ago and
 
03:00:30.170 --> 03:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
observed that many providers were
 
03:00:33.050 --> 03:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
billing like one cent for the vaccine I
 
03:00:35.269 --> 03:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
think just to clarify that that that was
 
03:00:36.830 --> 03:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
the reason the administration was being
 
03:00:40.070 --> 03:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
billed how a pharmacist would bill would
 
03:00:42.050 --> 03:00:42.060 align:start position:0%
be different than I think a medical care
 
03:00:44.030 --> 03:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
provider and that just has to do with
 
03:00:46.130 --> 03:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
the types of coding systems and billing
 
03:00:48.469 --> 03:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
forms that are used but I do believe
 
03:00:51.170 --> 03:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
that the the claims processing system
 
03:00:54.349 --> 03:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
between a pvm and a pharmacy does allow
 
03:00:56.929 --> 03:00:56.939 align:start position:0%
for payment for vaccines and the
 
03:00:58.610 --> 03:00:58.620 align:start position:0%
associate Administration so I wouldn't
 
03:01:01.490 --> 03:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
Envision that being a problem either but
 
03:01:03.050 --> 03:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
um but clearly the department would be
 
03:01:04.910 --> 03:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
happy to to work with the parties if
 
03:01:06.550 --> 03:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
issues do arise
 
03:01:09.410 --> 03:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
don't have much more to say I appreciate
 
03:01:11.150 --> 03:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
the chance to testify and happy to
 
03:01:12.769 --> 03:01:12.779 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
03:01:18.769 --> 03:01:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:21.290 --> 03:01:21.300 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair
 
03:01:21.300 --> 03:01:22.550 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair
yes

03:01:22.550 --> 03:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:01:26.030 --> 03:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
if I could to Mr Brennan thank you
 
03:01:29.150 --> 03:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
is it okay Mr chair chairman I am I
 
03:01:30.769 --> 03:01:30.779 align:start position:0%
don't know who's speaking this
 
03:01:32.570 --> 03:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant sorry
 
03:01:36.230 --> 03:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh there you are uh yeah okay
 
03:01:39.590 --> 03:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
um question to Mr Tyler Brennan um thank
 
03:01:40.910 --> 03:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question first and
 
03:01:40.920 --> 03:01:42.170 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question first and
foremost

03:01:42.170 --> 03:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
foremost
 
03:01:45.170 --> 03:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
my concern is that it's assumed that
 
03:01:47.870 --> 03:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
under the PBM contracts that that will
 
03:01:50.990 --> 03:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
be the case I'm just concerned that if
 
03:01:54.110 --> 03:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
we don't clarify that we could
 
03:01:55.730 --> 03:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
potentially have an unintended
 
03:01:58.190 --> 03:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
consequence where the pbms are not
 
03:02:00.410 --> 03:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
playing a ball which is different than
 
03:02:01.730 --> 03:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
the insurance carrier because they
 
03:02:03.170 --> 03:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
really work under the insurance company
 
03:02:05.450 --> 03:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
through a contract
 
03:02:07.730 --> 03:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
um so going forward we have the
 
03:02:07.740 --> 03:02:08.870 align:start position:0%
um so going forward we have the
possibility

03:02:08.870 --> 03:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
03:02:10.849 --> 03:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
that patients going into Pharmacy may
 
03:02:12.530 --> 03:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
not have reception because of the
 
03:02:18.670 --> 03:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:21.349 --> 03:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
okay so your question is perhaps whether
 
03:02:23.150 --> 03:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
or not we need some sort of Provider
 
03:02:25.730 --> 03:02:25.740 align:start position:0%
Contracting standard for pbns
 
03:02:25.740 --> 03:02:26.450 align:start position:0%
Contracting standard for pbns
um

03:02:26.450 --> 03:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:28.429 --> 03:02:28.439 align:start position:0%
this may be solving a problem that
 
03:02:29.990 --> 03:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist but I'm trying to think
 
03:02:32.090 --> 03:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
what I mean the the carrier is
 
03:02:34.010 --> 03:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
responsible for sort of making sure that
 
03:02:36.230 --> 03:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
a patient has access to the vaccine so
 
03:02:39.290 --> 03:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
if they refuse to pay a administrative
 
03:02:41.030 --> 03:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
fee or something that is equivalent to
 
03:02:44.389 --> 03:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
that to a PV um to a pharmacy I think
 
03:02:47.150 --> 03:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
that would raise some concerns about
 
03:02:50.030 --> 03:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
um about coverage but I I'd have to kind
 
03:02:51.349 --> 03:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
of go back and look and think about this
 
03:02:53.510 --> 03:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit more to to to be absolutely
 
03:02:55.670 --> 03:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
certain that your concern would be
 
03:02:57.410 --> 03:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
um fully addressed at least in existing
 
03:02:59.330 --> 03:02:59.340 align:start position:0%
statute now
 
03:03:01.490 --> 03:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:03:12.469 --> 03:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:16.070 --> 03:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:03:18.769 --> 03:03:18.779 align:start position:0%
thank you the chair now recognizes
 
03:03:34.849 --> 03:03:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:36.769 --> 03:03:36.779 align:start position:0%

03:04:36.769 --> 03:04:36.779 align:start position:0%
five years in the board of directors of

taking over the purchase of adult

vaccines because it would greatly
 
03:05:04.910 --> 03:05:04.920 align:start position:0%

03:05:09.849 --> 03:05:09.859 align:start position:0%
is doing very well and a financial
 
03:05:12.710 --> 03:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
analysis will demonstrate that
 
03:05:14.690 --> 03:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
I wish to thank representative konark
 
03:05:16.190 --> 03:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
for bringing this bill forward for
 
03:05:18.230 --> 03:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
discussion of this important issue and
 
03:05:19.849 --> 03:05:19.859 align:start position:0%
to finally Force an appropriate review
 
03:05:22.849 --> 03:05:22.859 align:start position:0%
of the costs information and documents
 
03:05:24.650 --> 03:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
that represent panerica has provided
 
03:05:26.389 --> 03:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
assist in this proper review of costs
 
03:05:27.889 --> 03:05:27.899 align:start position:0%
and will show a significant cost
 
03:05:30.769 --> 03:05:30.779 align:start position:0%
increase under this bill
 
03:05:33.050 --> 03:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
I also recognize representative Canuck's
 
03:05:35.570 --> 03:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
motives to be genuine and sincere to
 
03:05:37.070 --> 03:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
insist in bringing down costs of
 
03:05:38.809 --> 03:05:38.819 align:start position:0%
vaccines for New Hampshire consumers
 
03:05:40.849 --> 03:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
however this bill will actually do
 
03:05:42.950 --> 03:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
nothing to change the cost of vaccines
 
03:05:44.809 --> 03:05:44.819 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire consumers
 
03:05:47.090 --> 03:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
under the Affordable Care Act it is
 
03:05:48.889 --> 03:05:48.899 align:start position:0%
required the vaccines be provided
 
03:05:51.110 --> 03:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
without cost
 
03:05:54.230 --> 03:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
to all covered persons there may however
 
03:05:56.570 --> 03:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
be as you've heard discussed a charge
 
03:05:59.210 --> 03:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
for the administrative cost injection of
 
03:06:01.969 --> 03:06:01.979 align:start position:0%
the vaccine but also a cost perhaps for
 
03:06:04.670 --> 03:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
the office visit with the doctor this
 
03:06:07.550 --> 03:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
bill does not change those costs those
 
03:06:10.190 --> 03:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
over age 65 are covered by Medicare and
 
03:06:12.950 --> 03:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
this bill would have no effect on them
 
03:06:15.230 --> 03:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
this bill would have no impact on the
 
03:06:18.349 --> 03:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
poor without insurance and DHHS provides
 
03:06:20.450 --> 03:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
as you've heard under current law many
 
03:06:22.070 --> 03:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine clinics where the poor may
 
03:06:24.830 --> 03:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
receive vaccines free of charge they
 
03:06:26.510 --> 03:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
will not be able to and it was a
 
03:06:28.670 --> 03:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation go into a doctor's if
 
03:06:30.050 --> 03:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
you are uninsured you would not be able
 
03:06:32.750 --> 03:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
to go into a pharmacy and receive this
 
03:06:36.410 --> 03:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
free Supply as an uninsured person
 
03:06:39.290 --> 03:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
um because the uninsured person had
 
03:06:41.090 --> 03:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
nobody who paid into the purchase of
 
03:06:43.070 --> 03:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
these vaccines so that's how it works
 
03:06:45.710 --> 03:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
with the child program you need to be
 
03:06:47.809 --> 03:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
insured to access this supply of
 
03:06:50.030 --> 03:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
vaccines so that was a misstatement I
 
03:06:52.190 --> 03:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
wish to clarify there
 
03:06:54.349 --> 03:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
between private businesses the insurance
 
03:06:56.450 --> 03:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
industry and DHHS there's currently
 
03:06:58.610 --> 03:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
ample supply of adult vaccines provided
 
03:07:01.550 --> 03:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
cost effectively in many locations from
 
03:07:03.830 --> 03:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
your doctor's office to clinics to the
 
03:07:05.929 --> 03:07:05.939 align:start position:0%
corner drug stores gosh you can even
 
03:07:08.510 --> 03:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
give vaccines in a grocery store we do
 
03:07:10.790 --> 03:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
not have an availability of vaccine
 
03:07:10.800 --> 03:07:12.590 align:start position:0%
not have an availability of vaccine
issue

03:07:12.590 --> 03:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:07:14.990 --> 03:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
I wish to remind all that this bill is
 
03:07:16.670 --> 03:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
not about the benefit or risk of
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
vaccines it is not about whether or not
 
03:07:21.469 --> 03:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
people should get vaccines and it's not
 
03:07:24.410 --> 03:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
about mandating vaccines this bill is
 
03:07:27.349 --> 03:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
squarely focused on the cost of vaccines
 
03:07:29.450 --> 03:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
there are a number of concerns relative
 
03:07:32.269 --> 03:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
to this bill and I did send the
 
03:07:34.389 --> 03:07:34.399 align:start position:0%
committee an email yesterday afternoon
 
03:07:37.309 --> 03:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
and those concerns
 
03:07:39.469 --> 03:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
um include that the child vaccine
 
03:07:43.670 --> 03:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
purchase program would be put at risk
 
03:07:45.889 --> 03:07:45.899 align:start position:0%
currently the child vaccines are being
 
03:07:47.510 --> 03:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
purchased through the the federal
 
03:07:51.410 --> 03:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
contract with the vfc program that vfc
 
03:07:55.010 --> 03:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
program is originated from the the
 
03:07:57.950 --> 03:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
section 1928 of the Social Security Act
 
03:07:59.990 --> 03:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
that provides for that Federal program
 
03:08:02.269 --> 03:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
that provides vaccines for poor children
 
03:08:06.230 --> 03:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
it is exclusively a pediatric vaccine
 
03:08:08.809 --> 03:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
purchase program there was no authority
 
03:08:12.530 --> 03:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
to use that vfc contract in that program
 
03:08:15.710 --> 03:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
for the purchase of adult vaccines and
 
03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
the concern is of course if there's
 
03:08:20.510 --> 03:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
effort to violate that Federal contract
 
03:08:23.090 --> 03:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
that the the
 
03:08:24.769 --> 03:08:24.779 align:start position:0%
um the vfc program in New Hampshire
 
03:08:27.050 --> 03:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
could be shut down and poor children
 
03:08:29.269 --> 03:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
could be left without vaccines so I
 
03:08:31.370 --> 03:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
caution us not to pass legislation that
 
03:08:33.710 --> 03:08:33.720 align:start position:0%
would violate that Federal contract in
 
03:08:35.389 --> 03:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
that email I did provide you with
 
03:08:38.870 --> 03:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
section 128 of the Social Security Act
 
03:08:41.389 --> 03:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
um the cost comparisons here are not
 
03:08:44.150 --> 03:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
accurate there has been comparisons of
 
03:08:46.610 --> 03:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
the CDC market price
 
03:08:47.870 --> 03:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
um numbers
 
03:08:49.490 --> 03:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
um which are actually manufactured
 
03:08:51.469 --> 03:08:51.479 align:start position:0%
suggested retail prices that no one
 
03:08:54.230 --> 03:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
actually pays Doctors Hospitals
 
03:08:56.150 --> 03:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
pharmacists are purchasing all their
 
03:08:57.830 --> 03:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
medical supplies and pharmaceuticals
 
03:09:00.590 --> 03:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
including vaccines through
 
03:09:02.809 --> 03:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
um provider discount programs group
 
03:09:04.910 --> 03:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
purchase programs and they recognize
 
03:09:07.070 --> 03:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
significant discounts for those programs
 
03:09:09.769 --> 03:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
including rebates but actually that's
 
03:09:12.050 --> 03:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
not even a relevant number here
 
03:09:15.290 --> 03:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
the true cost comparison is to compare
 
03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
the price that DHHS would purchase these
 
03:09:20.330 --> 03:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
vaccines for through what is the
 
03:09:22.250 --> 03:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
negotiated claim amount that insurance
 
03:09:25.250 --> 03:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
companies are paying because this we're
 
03:09:26.570 --> 03:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
talking about what insurance companies
 
03:09:27.590 --> 03:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
are going to pay either what they're
 
03:09:29.870 --> 03:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
paying now under the current model or
 
03:09:32.450 --> 03:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
what they would pay through this vaccine
 
03:09:34.790 --> 03:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
um Association so that is the cost
 
03:09:37.550 --> 03:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
comparison that we we need to to make
 
03:09:37.560 --> 03:09:39.410 align:start position:0%
comparison that we we need to to make
here

03:09:39.410 --> 03:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:09:41.929 --> 03:09:41.939 align:start position:0%
and um the costs keep growing with this
 
03:09:43.190 --> 03:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
you know this amendment that's been
 
03:09:45.050 --> 03:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
added to this bill
 
03:09:46.429 --> 03:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
um there is
 
03:09:49.190 --> 03:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
um now administrative costs totaling up
 
03:09:52.910 --> 03:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
to 848 000 a year plus whatever
 
03:09:56.090 --> 03:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
additional cost that the DHHS which has
 
03:09:57.590 --> 03:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
three seats on the board of the vaccine
 
03:10:00.110 --> 03:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
Association might deem as quote unquote
 
03:10:01.670 --> 03:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable and reasonable is actually
 
03:10:05.090 --> 03:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
the language used in the amendment
 
03:10:05.100 --> 03:10:06.110 align:start position:0%
the language used in the amendment
um

03:10:06.110 --> 03:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:08.210 --> 03:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:10:12.170 --> 03:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
the the pro the the funding of dhh Staff
 
03:10:14.750 --> 03:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
their vaccine registry their vaccine
 
03:10:17.389 --> 03:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
ordering and inventory program should be
 
03:10:19.370 --> 03:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
funded through the general fund it
 
03:10:21.050 --> 03:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
should not be born in the backs of New
 
03:10:22.730 --> 03:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire health insurance consumers
 
03:10:25.309 --> 03:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
will already pay some of the highest
 
03:10:28.490 --> 03:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
insurance rates in the nation
 
03:10:31.250 --> 03:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
this bill won't provide vaccines for
 
03:10:33.349 --> 03:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
many adults and may increase costs and
 
03:10:35.269 --> 03:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
limit availability
 
03:10:37.610 --> 03:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
let me explain that the bill does not
 
03:10:39.650 --> 03:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
will not provide vaccines if you're age
 
03:10:41.929 --> 03:10:41.939 align:start position:0%
65 and older it will not provide
 
03:10:44.870 --> 03:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines to the poor it will not provide
 
03:10:47.570 --> 03:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
vaccines if you're uninsured your doctor
 
03:10:49.250 --> 03:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
and pharmacist will still need to
 
03:10:51.530 --> 03:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
purchase vaccines for that population of
 
03:10:51.540 --> 03:10:52.610 align:start position:0%
purchase vaccines for that population of
adults

03:10:52.610 --> 03:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
adults
 
03:10:54.650 --> 03:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
they are getting remember they are
 
03:10:56.630 --> 03:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
getting their vaccines as a significant
 
03:10:58.610 --> 03:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
discount this doesn't speak to the cost
 
03:11:00.349 --> 03:11:00.359 align:start position:0%
this speaks to availability of vaccines
 
03:11:03.950 --> 03:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
because they're buying in bulk if now a
 
03:11:06.170 --> 03:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
a portion of the adult vaccines they
 
03:11:08.389 --> 03:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
purchase are being offloaded to be
 
03:11:09.889 --> 03:11:09.899 align:start position:0%
purchased through this program they will
 
03:11:12.590 --> 03:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
no longer have their bulk discounts that
 
03:11:14.870 --> 03:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
they currently enjoy so that would
 
03:11:17.150 --> 03:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
creates a disincentive for them to
 
03:11:19.910 --> 03:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
continue to stock adult vaccines for
 
03:11:22.790 --> 03:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
those age 65 and older those on Medicaid
 
03:11:26.809 --> 03:11:26.819 align:start position:0%
those are uninsured so it could put the
 
03:11:31.429 --> 03:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
adult vaccine availability at risk
 
03:11:33.710 --> 03:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
um and you know and and will they they
 
03:11:35.990 --> 03:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
abandon is not a viable business if they
 
03:11:38.150 --> 03:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
lose those discounts
 
03:11:38.160 --> 03:11:38.990 align:start position:0%
lose those discounts
um

03:11:38.990 --> 03:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:41.210 --> 03:11:41.220 align:start position:0%
this bill will be burdensome to those
 
03:11:43.490 --> 03:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
vaccine providers there will be a
 
03:11:45.110 --> 03:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
requirement that they may tune separate
 
03:11:47.750 --> 03:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine inventories for adults those
 
03:11:49.550 --> 03:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
that they get quote unquote free from
 
03:11:51.769 --> 03:11:51.779 align:start position:0%
the state need to go in a separate
 
03:11:54.530 --> 03:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
refrigerator and freezer from the
 
03:11:55.790 --> 03:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
refrigerator and freezer they now
 
03:11:58.849 --> 03:11:58.859 align:start position:0%
currently have for the inventory that
 
03:12:00.769 --> 03:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
they purchase and they own
 
03:12:03.950 --> 03:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
and there is no mechanism here for
 
03:12:05.809 --> 03:12:05.819 align:start position:0%
controls on that multi-million dollar
 
03:12:08.570 --> 03:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
inventory it appears to be on the honor
 
03:12:11.570 --> 03:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
System that you know busy pharmacists or
 
03:12:13.130 --> 03:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
their college intern or administers
 
03:12:14.750 --> 03:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine isn't going to reach into the
 
03:12:16.849 --> 03:12:16.859 align:start position:0%
free Supply and use it to administer
 
03:12:18.530 --> 03:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
somebody who's not covered under this
 
03:12:21.170 --> 03:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
program and I mean that's certainly
 
03:12:24.290 --> 03:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
that's not a solid um or Sound business
 
03:12:26.929 --> 03:12:26.939 align:start position:0%
practice and um we would certainly want
 
03:12:29.809 --> 03:12:29.819 align:start position:0%
oversight over that inventory
 
03:12:31.610 --> 03:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
um the the other
 
03:12:31.620 --> 03:12:32.389 align:start position:0%
um the the other
um

03:12:32.389 --> 03:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:35.510 --> 03:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
things to remember is that this um it's
 
03:12:37.490 --> 03:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
not a broken system the system we have
 
03:12:37.500 --> 03:12:38.330 align:start position:0%
not a broken system the system we have
now

03:12:38.330 --> 03:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:12:41.330 --> 03:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
um vaccines are already supplied at
 
03:12:42.830 --> 03:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
um like I say you can get them at a
 
03:12:45.170 --> 03:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
grocery store they're already free under
 
03:12:47.150 --> 03:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
the Affordable Care Act
 
03:12:49.130 --> 03:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
um consumers cannot be charged for the
 
03:12:50.809 --> 03:12:50.819 align:start position:0%
cost of vaccines
 
03:12:53.030 --> 03:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
um under Medicare you cannot be charged
 
03:12:55.309 --> 03:12:55.319 align:start position:0%
for the cost of vaccines
 
03:12:57.769 --> 03:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
um and the poor people are provided by
 
03:13:00.650 --> 03:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
DHHS this bill was actually not a
 
03:13:02.990 --> 03:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
request of insurance industry not a
 
03:13:05.150 --> 03:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
request of DHHS and not a request of the
 
03:13:08.809 --> 03:13:08.819 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association it was brought forth
 
03:13:10.849 --> 03:13:10.859 align:start position:0%
um by contact the representative canark
 
03:13:12.410 --> 03:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
had in the community concerns about
 
03:13:14.150 --> 03:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
costs of vaccines it appeared to be
 
03:13:17.750 --> 03:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
somebody over the age of 64 which of
 
03:13:19.910 --> 03:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
course wouldn't cover
 
03:13:23.450 --> 03:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
um the final consideration here is that
 
03:13:25.250 --> 03:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
DHHS is working around the clock during
 
03:13:27.950 --> 03:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
this coveted crisis and now is certainly
 
03:13:30.290 --> 03:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
not the time to burden them further
 
03:13:32.870 --> 03:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
we're trying to set up this new program
 
03:13:35.630 --> 03:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
so let's get back to normal first before
 
03:13:38.510 --> 03:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
we burden them I can walk you through
 
03:13:40.670 --> 03:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
the financial analysis that shows that
 
03:13:42.830 --> 03:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
this bill will increase costs three
 
03:13:44.210 --> 03:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
million one hundred and thirty one
 
03:13:48.710 --> 03:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
thousand 997 I did provide you with an
 
03:13:52.809 --> 03:13:52.819 align:start position:0%
email late last night that had some
 
03:13:54.769 --> 03:13:54.779 align:start position:0%
attachments to it
 
03:13:58.190 --> 03:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
and um let me walk you through that and
 
03:14:00.290 --> 03:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
remind you again this is not about the
 
03:14:02.750 --> 03:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
cost that doctors and pharmacists
 
03:14:05.210 --> 03:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
purchase vaccines for this is squarely
 
03:14:06.530 --> 03:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
talking about the cost to health
 
03:14:09.410 --> 03:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
insurers what they are paying to doctors
 
03:14:11.150 --> 03:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
and pharmacists versus what they would
 
03:14:13.849 --> 03:14:13.859 align:start position:0%
pay to DHHS for vaccines that is the
 
03:14:16.070 --> 03:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
cause comparison so please do not be
 
03:14:19.990 --> 03:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
distracted by any sort of CDC pricing
 
03:14:23.990 --> 03:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
this last night we will be able to read
 
03:14:26.210 --> 03:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
it we do need to move on we have several
 
03:14:28.490 --> 03:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
people who need to testify and we have
 
03:14:30.530 --> 03:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
as much fun coming would you take
 
03:14:30.540 --> 03:14:31.910 align:start position:0%
as much fun coming would you take
questions

03:14:31.910 --> 03:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:14:35.750 --> 03:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:38.530 --> 03:14:38.540 align:start position:0%
does anybody wish to ask a question
 
03:14:40.910 --> 03:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
03:14:42.590 --> 03:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh Miss Condon
 
03:14:47.929 --> 03:14:47.939 align:start position:0%
um we've confirmed your position what
 
03:14:49.730 --> 03:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
your position was at the New Hampshire
 
03:14:52.010 --> 03:14:52.020 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association
 
03:14:54.889 --> 03:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
I was a public board member there was
 
03:14:56.750 --> 03:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Senate President I
 
03:14:59.210 --> 03:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
served her five years and I was on the
 
03:15:02.210 --> 03:15:02.220 align:start position:0%
audit committee there and what I brought
 
03:15:04.610 --> 03:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
to that board is there were significant
 
03:15:07.490 --> 03:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
deficiencies in oversight in reporting
 
03:15:09.349 --> 03:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
and accountability
 
03:15:11.750 --> 03:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
um policies and procedures and I push
 
03:15:16.090 --> 03:15:16.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:18.590 --> 03:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:15:21.290 --> 03:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
um so do you believe I understand that
 
03:15:23.330 --> 03:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
this organization has to submit annual
 
03:15:25.610 --> 03:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
reports to the president of the Senate
 
03:15:27.110 --> 03:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house and the the
 
03:15:29.269 --> 03:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
governor do you believe that those
 
03:15:32.090 --> 03:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
reports that are submitted offer
 
03:15:33.769 --> 03:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
sufficient disclosure of the
 
03:15:36.110 --> 03:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
association's activities and their
 
03:15:38.030 --> 03:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
financial reports
 
03:15:39.830 --> 03:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question again you
 
03:15:41.090 --> 03:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
know as a member of the board in the
 
03:15:44.210 --> 03:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
audit committee those you know two-sided
 
03:15:44.220 --> 03:15:44.830 align:start position:0%
audit committee those you know two-sided
um

03:15:44.830 --> 03:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:47.690 --> 03:15:47.700 align:start position:0%
brochures essentially amount to you know
 
03:15:49.790 --> 03:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
a marketing brochure and we're not full
 
03:15:52.910 --> 03:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
disclosure at all they did um their own
 
03:15:56.630 --> 03:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
erroneous cost comparison of the vfc
 
03:15:58.969 --> 03:15:58.979 align:start position:0%
price and compared to market pricing
 
03:16:01.309 --> 03:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
costs which is not the comparison we
 
03:16:03.230 --> 03:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
need to look at and I've long argued
 
03:16:07.490 --> 03:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
that the comparison needs to be between
 
03:16:10.070 --> 03:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
um what the DHHS is paying for the
 
03:16:13.250 --> 03:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
vaccines compared to what the insurance
 
03:16:15.769 --> 03:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
industry pays on claims that negotiated
 
03:16:18.349 --> 03:16:18.359 align:start position:0%
discount because every service that
 
03:16:21.349 --> 03:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
insurance companies engage in with a
 
03:16:23.990 --> 03:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
provider they negotiate discounts they
 
03:16:25.849 --> 03:16:25.859 align:start position:0%
negotiate discounts on you know office
 
03:16:28.730 --> 03:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
visits vaccines and everything and as we
 
03:16:30.650 --> 03:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
saw in the the um New Hampshire
 
03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
insurance department document is they
 
03:16:35.210 --> 03:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
negotiate a discount of some 40 percent
 
03:16:38.929 --> 03:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
on vaccine uh claims
 
03:16:41.030 --> 03:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
and and that's the information that
 
03:16:42.889 --> 03:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
should be provided I think the amendment
 
03:16:46.190 --> 03:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
is deficient in what it calls for for
 
03:16:49.309 --> 03:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
disclosure to the legislature thank you
 
03:16:54.590 --> 03:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:58.309 --> 03:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair chairman uh Miss
 
03:17:01.969 --> 03:17:01.979 align:start position:0%
Condon my understanding is that in the
 
03:17:05.150 --> 03:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine world as far as what's free
 
03:17:07.570 --> 03:17:07.580 align:start position:0%
um this goes back to the prior
 
03:17:10.250 --> 03:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
Medicare what was created that would
 
03:17:12.650 --> 03:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
include influenza
 
03:17:14.630 --> 03:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
and also pneumococcal and one's pretty
 
03:17:17.690 --> 03:17:17.700 align:start position:0%
emergency like tetanus and so forth
 
03:17:19.490 --> 03:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
haven't been a practicing pharmacist I
 
03:17:20.870 --> 03:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
can assure you that there's many times
 
03:17:23.269 --> 03:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
in a pharmacy that patients have to pay
 
03:17:25.490 --> 03:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
for a vaccine and many times the cost of
 
03:17:27.889 --> 03:17:27.899 align:start position:0%
That vaccine is exorbitant even though
 
03:17:29.269 --> 03:17:29.279 align:start position:0%
it's being quote paid for by the
 
03:17:31.010 --> 03:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
insurance company because of the co-pays
 
03:17:33.050 --> 03:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
and deductibles so that does become a
 
03:17:34.670 --> 03:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
barrier to a lot of the patients getting
 
03:17:37.190 --> 03:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
a vaccine so I want to be clear at least
 
03:17:38.929 --> 03:17:38.939 align:start position:0%
my understanding haven't worked in the
 
03:17:40.969 --> 03:17:40.979 align:start position:0%
pharmacy for a long time that not all
 
03:17:44.750 --> 03:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:47.690 --> 03:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
um under the Affordable Care Act it is
 
03:17:49.849 --> 03:17:49.859 align:start position:0%
required for insurance individuals that
 
03:17:51.650 --> 03:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
there should not be a charge for the
 
03:17:54.650 --> 03:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
vaccine there may be charges for the
 
03:17:57.170 --> 03:17:57.180 align:start position:0%
administration of the vaccine subject to
 
03:17:59.570 --> 03:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
deductibles and co-pays and that's for
 
03:18:01.370 --> 03:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
insured individuals
 
03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know you might be talking about
 
03:18:07.010 --> 03:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
um Medicare patients Medicare
 
03:18:09.530 --> 03:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
individuals Governor part b or d but
 
03:18:11.630 --> 03:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
again this bill does not address that
 
03:18:16.960 --> 03:18:16.970 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:16.970 --> 03:18:18.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:18:18.590 --> 03:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:18:21.650 --> 03:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Kelsey
 
03:18:24.170 --> 03:18:24.180 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman uh Miss Condon
 
03:18:26.150 --> 03:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
do you think it would be fair and even
 
03:18:28.130 --> 03:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
reasonable to fund a state vaccine
 
03:18:30.710 --> 03:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
registry an Associated Department of
 
03:18:32.570 --> 03:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services staff through
 
03:18:34.969 --> 03:18:34.979 align:start position:0%
the vaccine Association
 
03:18:37.250 --> 03:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
I I actually think that's tremendously
 
03:18:37.260 --> 03:18:38.750 align:start position:0%
I I actually think that's tremendously
unfair

03:18:38.750 --> 03:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
unfair
 
03:18:41.630 --> 03:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
um to impose that you know burden on uh
 
03:18:44.330 --> 03:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Insurance consumers the
 
03:18:46.670 --> 03:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
statute provides for every dollar of
 
03:18:49.490 --> 03:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
this cost to be funneled through
 
03:18:51.769 --> 03:18:51.779 align:start position:0%
um and included in in premiums as
 
03:18:53.809 --> 03:18:53.819 align:start position:0%
Medical Loss and I think that's a
 
03:18:55.910 --> 03:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
violation of the the federal Affordable
 
03:18:58.010 --> 03:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
Care Act that it protects New Hampshire
 
03:19:00.349 --> 03:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
consumers from excessive administrative
 
03:19:02.929 --> 03:19:02.939 align:start position:0%
costs and what this does by placing on
 
03:19:05.929 --> 03:19:05.939 align:start position:0%
the burden of insured individuals it it
 
03:19:08.269 --> 03:19:08.279 align:start position:0%
means that the rest of those in the
 
03:19:11.090 --> 03:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
state who might be using these um DHHS
 
03:19:13.250 --> 03:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
Services of the vaccine registry which
 
03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
include Medicare Medicaid individuals
 
03:19:19.490 --> 03:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
the uninsured are not paying the burden
 
03:19:21.950 --> 03:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
of that so this is very much unfairly
 
03:19:24.050 --> 03:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
imposed on New Hampshire Insurance
 
03:19:26.150 --> 03:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
consumers driving up our rates further
 
03:19:29.090 --> 03:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
anyone else from the committee who
 
03:19:37.790 --> 03:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:39.889 --> 03:19:39.899 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
03:19:42.490 --> 03:19:42.500 align:start position:0%
now recognizes Jessica
 
03:20:01.250 --> 03:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:04.849 --> 03:20:04.859 align:start position:0%
we have Jessica kliskey
 
03:20:07.550 --> 03:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
03:20:10.910 --> 03:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you Mr chairman Pearson
 
03:20:12.889 --> 03:20:12.899 align:start position:0%
for taking my comment
 
03:20:15.710 --> 03:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
um I second everything that Laura Condon
 
03:20:18.469 --> 03:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
said but I wanted to point out a figure
 
03:20:21.650 --> 03:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
for the people who in New Hampshire that
 
03:20:23.809 --> 03:20:23.819 align:start position:0%
are enrolled in the Medicaid Program
 
03:20:26.030 --> 03:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
which is around 45
 
03:20:28.610 --> 03:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
000. that's significant for people who
 
03:20:30.349 --> 03:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
won't be at um
 
03:20:33.230 --> 03:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
you know this this this bill would not
 
03:20:35.929 --> 03:20:35.939 align:start position:0%
be effective for and
 
03:20:38.269 --> 03:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
um also because we're talking about
 
03:20:38.279 --> 03:20:40.490 align:start position:0%
um also because we're talking about
costs

03:20:40.490 --> 03:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:20:42.410 --> 03:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to remember
 
03:20:46.309 --> 03:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
that back in 2014 we spent about 1.4
 
03:20:49.370 --> 03:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars on um a contract to
 
03:20:52.730 --> 03:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
build an immunization registry that was
 
03:20:52.740 --> 03:20:54.170 align:start position:0%
build an immunization registry that was
failed

03:20:54.170 --> 03:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
failed
 
03:20:57.290 --> 03:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
um and you know we heard a lot about we
 
03:20:58.969 --> 03:20:58.979 align:start position:0%
have the highest rates of vaccinations
 
03:21:01.969 --> 03:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
then we need this money to spend on this
 
03:21:05.090 --> 03:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
um on this bill so I I just question
 
03:21:05.100 --> 03:21:06.290 align:start position:0%
um on this bill so I I just question
um

03:21:06.290 --> 03:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:08.450 --> 03:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
you know if everything is
 
03:21:11.210 --> 03:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
um as it seems that's pretty much all I
 
03:21:12.830 --> 03:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
have Laura said everything else that I
 
03:21:14.809 --> 03:21:14.819 align:start position:0%
was going to point out so thank you for
 
03:21:15.889 --> 03:21:15.899 align:start position:0%
your time
 
03:21:18.590 --> 03:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you it's from the
 
03:21:18.600 --> 03:21:23.090 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you it's from the
committee

03:21:23.090 --> 03:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:26.889 --> 03:21:26.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:31.429 --> 03:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh thank you Miss Chrissy for
 
03:21:33.710 --> 03:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
explaining he said something about in
 
03:21:37.969 --> 03:21:37.979 align:start position:0%
2014 we spent over a million on what
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
then it failed
 
03:21:42.410 --> 03:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
um we hired science Technologies
 
03:21:45.769 --> 03:21:45.779 align:start position:0%
Corporation to build what I'm assuming
 
03:21:49.730 --> 03:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
is a technology piece to an immunization
 
03:21:51.950 --> 03:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
registry that was
 
03:21:53.389 --> 03:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
um not completed
 
03:21:56.330 --> 03:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
from what I understand so I just wonder
 
03:21:59.450 --> 03:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
if we need to consider that not
 
03:21:59.460 --> 03:22:00.650 align:start position:0%
if we need to consider that not
everything

03:22:00.650 --> 03:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
everything
 
03:22:00.660 --> 03:22:01.370 align:start position:0%
everything
um

03:22:01.370 --> 03:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:02.510 --> 03:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
you know that we're going to have
 
03:22:05.090 --> 03:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
taxpayers pay is
 
03:22:07.490 --> 03:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
um necessary
 
03:22:12.170 --> 03:22:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:14.710 --> 03:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much the chair recognizes
 
03:22:26.230 --> 03:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:28.610 --> 03:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair members of
 
03:22:30.650 --> 03:22:30.660 align:start position:0%
the committee I'll be very brief here uh
 
03:22:32.450 --> 03:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
again my name is Andrew Hosmer I'm
 
03:22:34.010 --> 03:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
representing Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare
 
03:22:35.570 --> 03:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire's largest
 
03:22:38.630 --> 03:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit Health insurer
 
03:22:38.640 --> 03:22:39.590 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit Health insurer
um

03:22:39.590 --> 03:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:42.650 --> 03:22:42.660 align:start position:0%
we certainly support the bill as amended
 
03:22:46.969 --> 03:22:46.979 align:start position:0%
and I'd second comments made by previous
 
03:22:49.250 --> 03:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
proponents uh including uh Sabrina
 
03:22:52.790 --> 03:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
Dunlap so we're our we are anxious to
 
03:22:54.349 --> 03:22:54.359 align:start position:0%
continue working with stakeholders to
 
03:22:55.550 --> 03:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
increase the number of people who
 
03:22:58.190 --> 03:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
receive needed vaccines that lowers the
 
03:22:59.750 --> 03:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
cost of acquiring and dispensing
 
03:23:02.030 --> 03:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
vaccines and puts in place a process
 
03:23:03.830 --> 03:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
that allows for transparency and
 
03:23:06.110 --> 03:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
accountability so for these reasons we
 
03:23:08.090 --> 03:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
are in support of Representative nurse
 
03:23:10.849 --> 03:23:10.859 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you very much thank you
 
03:23:13.429 --> 03:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
when you take a question if there is one
 
03:23:18.349 --> 03:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:20.809 --> 03:23:20.819 align:start position:0%
CNN thank you for your testimony Mr
 
03:23:21.769 --> 03:23:21.779 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:23:24.650 --> 03:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
you're recognizes Joanne rainville a
 
03:23:34.150 --> 03:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:34.160 --> 03:23:36.070 align:start position:0%
 
hello

03:23:36.070 --> 03:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
hello
 
03:23:38.990 --> 03:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
hi good you can hear me I'm kind of new
 
03:23:40.670 --> 03:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
to zoom
 
03:23:43.190 --> 03:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
um yes I am a member of the public and I
 
03:23:45.889 --> 03:23:45.899 align:start position:0%
am also the on Executive Director of the
 
03:23:48.830 --> 03:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
Tamworth Nurse Association
 
03:23:51.290 --> 03:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
um and I was the one who went and and
 
03:23:55.010 --> 03:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
got Jerry Corner's ear and said we need
 
03:23:57.710 --> 03:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
help getting vaccines into people and
 
03:23:59.150 --> 03:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have to come with their
 
03:24:01.070 --> 03:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
hat in their hand
 
03:24:04.190 --> 03:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
um to be able to get a flu vaccine
 
03:24:07.190 --> 03:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
and in with the Tamworth Community
 
03:24:09.410 --> 03:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
nurses we don't Bill anyone so we don't
 
03:24:11.450 --> 03:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
build Medicare or Medicaid or any of
 
03:24:15.229 --> 03:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
those things but we really try and get
 
03:24:18.290 --> 03:24:18.300 align:start position:0%
people be a conduit for people to be
 
03:24:21.170 --> 03:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
able to get health care when I started a
 
03:24:21.180 --> 03:24:22.910 align:start position:0%
able to get health care when I started a
tcna

03:24:22.910 --> 03:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
tcna
 
03:24:25.130 --> 03:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
um 20 years ago now
 
03:24:29.809 --> 03:24:29.819 align:start position:0%
uh vial of vaccine was 38 dollars
 
03:24:33.590 --> 03:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's now about 175 dollars
 
03:24:36.410 --> 03:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh when you're not billing anybody it's
 
03:24:38.990 --> 03:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
kind of hard to make up that cost and
 
03:24:42.769 --> 03:24:42.779 align:start position:0%
it's too important to stop to turn our
 
03:24:45.290 --> 03:24:45.300 align:start position:0%
back on people who need it we also have
 
03:24:48.170 --> 03:24:48.180 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind that there are people in
 
03:24:49.670 --> 03:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'm sure in every
 
03:24:53.269 --> 03:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
state that I'm not signed up for
 
03:24:53.279 --> 03:24:54.830 align:start position:0%
state that I'm not signed up for
Medicaid

03:24:54.830 --> 03:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
03:24:57.710 --> 03:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
or help or different Health Options that
 
03:25:00.170 --> 03:25:00.180 align:start position:0%
they may have and that's for their own
 
03:25:03.410 --> 03:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
personal reasons but
 
03:25:05.929 --> 03:25:05.939 align:start position:0%
we want to keep those people healthy too
 
03:25:08.870 --> 03:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
because they turn around if they get the
 
03:25:08.880 --> 03:25:09.710 align:start position:0%
because they turn around if they get the
flu

03:25:09.710 --> 03:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
flu
 
03:25:12.410 --> 03:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
then they're probably going to infect
 
03:25:14.330 --> 03:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
other folks
 
03:25:16.250 --> 03:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
um and then there's just the fact that
 
03:25:19.790 --> 03:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
when especially frail people or people
 
03:25:22.490 --> 03:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
with pre-existing conditions they don't
 
03:25:24.650 --> 03:25:24.660 align:start position:0%
get the flu shot
 
03:25:27.830 --> 03:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
um that you know we see an increase in
 
03:25:31.309 --> 03:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations ER visits doctor's
 
03:25:33.950 --> 03:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
office visits and we've also got with
 
03:25:36.410 --> 03:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
covid people who are very reluctant to
 
03:25:38.929 --> 03:25:38.939 align:start position:0%
get near any health care provider
 
03:25:42.290 --> 03:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
so my thought when I first went to Jerry
 
03:25:46.550 --> 03:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
was let's just remove one barrier
 
03:25:49.729 --> 03:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
that stops one person from being able to
 
03:25:51.349 --> 03:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
get an inoculation
 
03:25:53.809 --> 03:25:53.819 align:start position:0%
and Jerry I thank you for your hard work
 
03:25:56.330 --> 03:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
on this and I thank this whole committee
 
03:25:58.550 --> 03:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
for letting me speak if you have any
 
03:26:06.610 --> 03:26:06.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:09.530 --> 03:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
saying not the final person on my sheet
 
03:26:09.540 --> 03:26:10.550 align:start position:0%
saying not the final person on my sheet
is

03:26:10.550 --> 03:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:26:13.250 --> 03:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
Heidi Kroll from America's health
 
03:26:16.910 --> 03:26:16.920 align:start position:0%

en

03:26:19.550 --> 03:26:19.560 align:start position:0%

um and I am home with my son this
 
03:26:40.429 --> 03:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
afternoon so I apologize if you hear
 
03:26:42.110 --> 03:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
background noise
 
03:26:46.790 --> 03:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
um uh ahip um does not take any position
 
03:26:48.950 --> 03:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
um or it's neutral on the underlying
 
03:26:48.960 --> 03:26:50.090 align:start position:0%
um or it's neutral on the underlying
question

03:26:50.090 --> 03:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:26:51.769 --> 03:26:51.779 align:start position:0%
um that all of you are facing as to
 
03:26:54.830 --> 03:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not to expand the vaccine
 
03:26:56.929 --> 03:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
program to adults
 
03:27:00.590 --> 03:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
um but we uh certainly are supportive of
 
03:27:03.050 --> 03:27:03.060 align:start position:0%
um promoting the use of vaccines to
 
03:27:05.330 --> 03:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
prevent disease
 
03:27:07.370 --> 03:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
um save lives and reduce unnecessary
 
03:27:09.650 --> 03:27:09.660 align:start position:0%
health care costs and if the
 
03:27:11.090 --> 03:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
commission's decision or this
 
03:27:13.309 --> 03:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
committee's decision is to expand the
 
03:27:17.030 --> 03:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
program then ahip is supportive of the
 
03:27:20.269 --> 03:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
um Amendment um to House Bill 604 which
 
03:27:22.010 --> 03:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
you've been discussing here
 
03:27:25.309 --> 03:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
um for the past hour or so
 
03:27:27.590 --> 03:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
um From ahib's perspective there are
 
03:27:29.210 --> 03:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
several important aspects of the
 
03:27:30.410 --> 03:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
amendment that I would just like to
 
03:27:32.269 --> 03:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
quickly touch upon
 
03:27:35.150 --> 03:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
um one is the capping
 
03:27:37.010 --> 03:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Health and Human
 
03:27:39.110 --> 03:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
Services administrative costs associated
 
03:27:41.450 --> 03:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
with the vaccine program
 
03:27:43.250 --> 03:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
um there's two aspects Happening Here
 
03:27:46.969 --> 03:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
one is that carriers will be assessed
 
03:27:50.809 --> 03:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
for the full cost of dhs's
 
03:27:53.090 --> 03:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
administrative costs associated with the
 
03:27:55.969 --> 03:27:55.979 align:start position:0%
adult program in addition
 
03:27:58.910 --> 03:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
um carriers will be asked to Bear
 
03:28:00.969 --> 03:28:00.979 align:start position:0%
through assessments
 
03:28:04.370 --> 03:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
approximately 60 percent of hhs's
 
03:28:06.530 --> 03:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
administrative costs associated with the
 
03:28:10.610 --> 03:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccine so both of those costs
 
03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
coming from hhs's administration of
 
03:28:17.150 --> 03:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
programs would be new in terms of being
 
03:28:21.290 --> 03:28:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh part of the assessment on carriers so
 
03:28:24.229 --> 03:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
um we were concerned uh to make sure
 
03:28:24.239 --> 03:28:25.250 align:start position:0%
um we were concerned uh to make sure
that

03:28:25.250 --> 03:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:28:27.469 --> 03:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
um there's kind of a checks and balances
 
03:28:29.929 --> 03:28:29.939 align:start position:0%
on the administrative costs so that we
 
03:28:32.690 --> 03:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
don't erode these savings
 
03:28:34.610 --> 03:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
um from purchasing vaccines through the
 
03:28:34.620 --> 03:28:35.510 align:start position:0%
um from purchasing vaccines through the
program

03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:28:35.520 --> 03:28:37.070 align:start position:0%
program
okay

03:28:37.070 --> 03:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:28:39.170 --> 03:28:39.180 align:start position:0%
um the second uh piece that's important
 
03:28:41.510 --> 03:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
to us um with this is the enhanced
 
03:28:44.030 --> 03:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
annual reporting on program cost and
 
03:28:44.040 --> 03:28:45.469 align:start position:0%
annual reporting on program cost and
savings

03:28:45.469 --> 03:28:45.479 align:start position:0%
savings
 
03:28:46.790 --> 03:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
um having listened to the discussion
 
03:28:48.590 --> 03:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
this morning there's perhaps more that
 
03:28:49.910 --> 03:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
can be done
 
03:28:51.710 --> 03:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
um to further enhance that but Our
 
03:28:54.530 --> 03:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
intention at least was to increase the
 
03:28:54.540 --> 03:28:56.210 align:start position:0%
intention at least was to increase the
transparency

03:28:56.210 --> 03:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
03:28:58.190 --> 03:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
um and accountability
 
03:29:00.410 --> 03:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
um in terms of making sure that the
 
03:29:03.830 --> 03:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
public and legislators have uh easy and
 
03:29:05.750 --> 03:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
ready access to
 
03:29:08.210 --> 03:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
um good information about the the cost
 
03:29:10.309 --> 03:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
and the savings
 
03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
um and the final piece um that was
 
03:29:13.550 --> 03:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
important to us and and I should say
 
03:29:16.250 --> 03:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
that um uh representative Corner
 
03:29:18.469 --> 03:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
um and other stakeholders really spent a
 
03:29:20.150 --> 03:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
lot of time
 
03:29:22.190 --> 03:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
um talking with the carriers talking
 
03:29:23.510 --> 03:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
with me
 
03:29:25.010 --> 03:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
um and just a lot of stakeholder
 
03:29:29.030 --> 03:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
dialogue uh over many many many weeks
 
03:29:31.070 --> 03:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
and we're very appreciative for that
 
03:29:32.990 --> 03:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
process so I neglected to say that in
 
03:29:35.269 --> 03:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
the beginning but um I wanted to mention
 
03:29:38.389 --> 03:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
that um it was a very good process uh so
 
03:29:40.190 --> 03:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
in the third piece that was important to
 
03:29:40.200 --> 03:29:41.030 align:start position:0%
in the third piece that was important to
us

03:29:41.030 --> 03:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:29:42.950 --> 03:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
um and uh we think has made an
 
03:29:44.809 --> 03:29:44.819 align:start position:0%
improvement to the bill uh with the
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
amendment is simply clarifying the
 
03:29:49.130 --> 03:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
duties of the accessible entities namely
 
03:29:50.630 --> 03:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
the carriers
 
03:29:51.769 --> 03:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
um and there's been some discussion
 
03:29:54.650 --> 03:29:54.660 align:start position:0%
about that but uh carriers um are
 
03:29:57.349 --> 03:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
committed um to
 
03:29:59.750 --> 03:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
um paying for the administration of the
 
03:30:02.990 --> 03:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine namely paying providers to um
 
03:30:05.210 --> 03:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
Put the Needle in somebody's arm and
 
03:30:06.830 --> 03:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
administer the vaccine
 
03:30:09.349 --> 03:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
um but because we are or would be paying
 
03:30:12.349 --> 03:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
for this this vaccine through the
 
03:30:15.530 --> 03:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
assessment we were concerned about being
 
03:30:18.229 --> 03:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
double billed if you will and so the
 
03:30:21.250 --> 03:30:21.260 align:start position:0%
language and the amendment I think
 
03:30:24.050 --> 03:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
alleviates that concern
 
03:30:26.450 --> 03:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
um and it should also help ensure that
 
03:30:29.210 --> 03:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
uh you know the savings are maximized
 
03:30:31.250 --> 03:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of New Hampshire
 
03:30:31.260 --> 03:30:32.450 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of New Hampshire
citizens

03:30:32.450 --> 03:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
03:30:35.330 --> 03:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'd be happy to answer
 
03:30:37.490 --> 03:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
any questions or if I'm not able to I
 
03:30:39.590 --> 03:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
can take them back and and respond later
 
03:30:41.030 --> 03:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
but I appreciate your time this
 
03:30:43.370 --> 03:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you very much
 
03:30:47.870 --> 03:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
any questions for Ms Cole
 
03:30:49.490 --> 03:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
03:30:51.889 --> 03:30:51.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:30:54.769 --> 03:30:54.779 align:start position:0%
taking my question how do we get the
 
03:30:57.650 --> 03:30:57.660 align:start position:0%
actual cost of the vaccine since it's
 
03:31:01.130 --> 03:31:01.140 align:start position:0%
been pointed out to us that the
 
03:31:04.550 --> 03:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
comparison of the new purchase price is
 
03:31:07.969 --> 03:31:07.979 align:start position:0%
this if we pass the Bill if we get that
 
03:31:10.610 --> 03:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
price and compare it to what is
 
03:31:13.070 --> 03:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
currently being paid
 
03:31:17.030 --> 03:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
is not the retail what is the wheel
 
03:31:22.750 --> 03:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:26.990 --> 03:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not the best data person to to
 
03:31:29.269 --> 03:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
ask your question of um my you know my
 
03:31:32.030 --> 03:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is um I have seen the um
 
03:31:33.830 --> 03:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
report that the insurance department
 
03:31:36.950 --> 03:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
prepared I believe it was last January
 
03:31:39.170 --> 03:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
um when when the uh last year's version
 
03:31:41.690 --> 03:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
of this bill was being considered and so
 
03:31:43.790 --> 03:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
you know I my understanding is that in
 
03:31:46.670 --> 03:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
that report it sets forth um information
 
03:31:50.929 --> 03:31:50.939 align:start position:0%
about what the carriers were billed by
 
03:31:54.530 --> 03:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
providers for the cost of the vaccine
 
03:31:56.750 --> 03:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
the actual product
 
03:32:00.050 --> 03:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
um and that what and then what carriers
 
03:32:03.950 --> 03:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
actually reimbursed exactly that and
 
03:32:06.889 --> 03:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
that report also includes
 
03:32:10.910 --> 03:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
um some estimates or averages of what
 
03:32:15.170 --> 03:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
um the CDC price
 
03:32:18.769 --> 03:32:18.779 align:start position:0%
would have been had we paid a CDC price
 
03:32:21.889 --> 03:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
instead of a carrier reimbursement
 
03:32:23.690 --> 03:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
um that that's the data that I'm Avail
 
03:32:25.790 --> 03:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of
 
03:32:29.929 --> 03:32:29.939 align:start position:0%
um but I and I uh I can't
 
03:32:31.790 --> 03:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
speak to some of the other data that's
 
03:32:33.469 --> 03:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
been discussed here this morning I
 
03:32:35.090 --> 03:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
apologize it's just not my area of
 
03:32:35.100 --> 03:32:36.410 align:start position:0%

Miller I'm the executive director for
 
03:33:09.650 --> 03:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire vaccine Association
 
03:33:11.150 --> 03:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
um as mentioned earlier we are created
 
03:33:14.570 --> 03:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
by Statute in 2002 to manage the
 
03:33:17.389 --> 03:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccine program we don't set
 
03:33:19.550 --> 03:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
any vaccine policy or create vaccine
 
03:33:23.090 --> 03:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
laws but we do collect the assessments
 
03:33:25.010 --> 03:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
um and and place those assessments on
 
03:33:26.809 --> 03:33:26.819 align:start position:0%
the carriers and then provide that
 
03:33:28.910 --> 03:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
funding uh to the State's Department of
 
03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to purchase
 
03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
the vaccines
 
03:33:34.490 --> 03:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
um while the New Hampshire vaccine
 
03:33:36.769 --> 03:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
Association cannot take a position for
 
03:33:38.330 --> 03:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
or against the bill
 
03:33:40.729 --> 03:33:40.739 align:start position:0%
um the vaccine Association has worked
 
03:33:42.349 --> 03:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
closely with representative knurk the
 
03:33:43.910 --> 03:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
insurers and other stakeholders have
 
03:33:45.469 --> 03:33:45.479 align:start position:0%
been on this call regarding the Bill's
 
03:33:47.870 --> 03:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
language revisions our goal is to just
 
03:33:49.250 --> 03:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
be ready to implement the program
 
03:33:51.410 --> 03:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
changes and ensure that the department
 
03:33:53.510 --> 03:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
receives the necessary funds to support
 
03:33:56.750 --> 03:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
the universal vaccine purchasing program
 
03:33:59.330 --> 03:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
I think in terms of uh representative
 
03:34:02.150 --> 03:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
Gay's questions around the costs um
 
03:34:04.190 --> 03:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
there are there is publicly available
 
03:34:06.650 --> 03:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
data that I can provide to you that we
 
03:34:08.570 --> 03:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
receive from the Department that shows
 
03:34:10.910 --> 03:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
the uh essentially the purchase price
 
03:34:14.269 --> 03:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
that the department is paying today uh
 
03:34:16.849 --> 03:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
compared with the retail price
 
03:34:18.950 --> 03:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
um so that that data is currently
 
03:34:21.950 --> 03:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
available and can certainly provide that
 
03:34:23.090 --> 03:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:34:25.010 --> 03:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
um I would say also in terms of the
 
03:34:27.290 --> 03:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
public reporting piece we have
 
03:34:29.929 --> 03:34:29.939 align:start position:0%
um work to try to increase what would be
 
03:34:33.229 --> 03:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
reported publicly in terms of the
 
03:34:35.330 --> 03:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill and certainly
 
03:34:36.889 --> 03:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
would be willing to work with the
 
03:34:39.050 --> 03:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
committee or others to uh to continue
 
03:34:41.330 --> 03:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
those discussions and to make sure that
 
03:34:43.910 --> 03:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
there's full transparency we do operate
 
03:34:46.370 --> 03:34:46.380 align:start position:0%
under the state's right to no laws and
 
03:34:48.650 --> 03:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
all of our information is uh is publicly
 
03:34:51.410 --> 03:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
available on our website so if you have
 
03:34:53.269 --> 03:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
any further questions I'm just here
 
03:34:55.550 --> 03:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
today to be able to answer them around
 
03:34:56.929 --> 03:34:56.939 align:start position:0%
the mechanics of the Hampshire vaccine
 
03:34:59.330 --> 03:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
Association and the work that we do on a
 
03:35:01.130 --> 03:35:01.140 align:start position:0%
daily basis so thank you for your time
 
03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
this morning for this afternoon at this
 
03:35:03.000 --> 03:35:06.130 align:start position:0%
this morning for this afternoon at this
point

03:35:06.130 --> 03:35:06.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:10.070 --> 03:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative McMahon thank you Mr
 
03:35:13.309 --> 03:35:13.319 align:start position:0%
Miller yes I will assume that you heard
 
03:35:15.110 --> 03:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
the testimony of a former member of your
 
03:35:17.030 --> 03:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
organization is founded
 
03:35:20.030 --> 03:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
yes and she stated that they clocked
 
03:35:21.950 --> 03:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
zero to three million dollars based on
 
03:35:23.630 --> 03:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
the database that she provided all of us
 
03:35:26.750 --> 03:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
is that factual or made up
 
03:35:29.870 --> 03:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
um I I think it differs from the uh cost
 
03:35:31.490 --> 03:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
estimates that the insurance department
 
03:35:33.050 --> 03:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Health and Human
 
03:35:33.060 --> 03:35:34.550 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Health and Human
Services

03:35:34.550 --> 03:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
Services
 
03:35:37.490 --> 03:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
um have already provided testimony on
 
03:35:37.500 --> 03:35:41.410 align:start position:0%
um have already provided testimony on
[Music]

03:35:41.410 --> 03:35:41.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:44.210 --> 03:35:44.220 align:start position:0%
I get the benefit of your
 
03:35:47.570 --> 03:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
guidance Mr Miller is that the testimony
 
03:35:51.050 --> 03:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
provided by this Condon should not be
 
03:35:58.990 --> 03:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:01.729 --> 03:36:01.739 align:start position:0%
could you perhaps clarify that question
 
03:36:04.610 --> 03:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that I well yeah exactly
 
03:36:06.889 --> 03:36:06.899 align:start position:0%
what you're asking Mr chairman yes go
 
03:36:08.210 --> 03:36:08.220 align:start position:0%
ahead I answered the question
 
03:36:12.050 --> 03:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
specifically as to a um the basis of
 
03:36:14.510 --> 03:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
being a State Rep deciding policy for
 
03:36:17.510 --> 03:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
every citizen in our in our state and
 
03:36:19.490 --> 03:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
that will be here in testimony is in
 
03:36:30.250 --> 03:36:30.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:32.570 --> 03:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:36:35.510 --> 03:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
under understood I guess what I can
 
03:36:37.969 --> 03:36:37.979 align:start position:0%
certainly report about the program is
 
03:36:39.950 --> 03:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
based upon again the the data that's
 
03:36:41.269 --> 03:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
been provided through the insurance
 
03:36:43.670 --> 03:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
department the health department
 
03:36:46.250 --> 03:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
um it's believed that um what's a fact
 
03:36:48.950 --> 03:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
that vaccines will be able to be
 
03:36:51.710 --> 03:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
purchased um for a lower cost it will
 
03:36:53.870 --> 03:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
increase access
 
03:36:56.570 --> 03:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
um and um you know ultimately should
 
03:36:58.250 --> 03:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
allow uh theoretically insurance
 
03:37:00.769 --> 03:37:00.779 align:start position:0%
premiums to be decreased at some level
 
03:37:02.630 --> 03:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
given the fact that the insurers are
 
03:37:04.250 --> 03:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
receiving you know discount on the
 
03:37:07.070 --> 03:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine so uh from from my perspective
 
03:37:08.750 --> 03:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
I'm working with the data that's been
 
03:37:12.650 --> 03:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
provided to us by the two uh departments
 
03:37:15.710 --> 03:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
and um and that's really what we use for
 
03:37:18.170 --> 03:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
our Actuarial models that sets the rate
 
03:37:21.050 --> 03:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
every year we also I think just in terms
 
03:37:23.809 --> 03:37:23.819 align:start position:0%
of our board composition it's important
 
03:37:25.849 --> 03:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
to point out that we do have
 
03:37:28.630 --> 03:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
representatives from the insurance
 
03:37:32.030 --> 03:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
industry that that sit on that board and
 
03:37:34.570 --> 03:37:34.580 align:start position:0%
provide oversight but we also have
 
03:37:37.190 --> 03:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
oversight board members that are from
 
03:37:39.170 --> 03:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
the government from Health Care
 
03:37:41.809 --> 03:37:41.819 align:start position:0%
Providers and public members as well
 
03:37:45.050 --> 03:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
self-insured entities so their their
 
03:37:46.969 --> 03:37:46.979 align:start position:0%
focus as I mentioned a few minutes ago
 
03:37:49.070 --> 03:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
is is not to set the policy but it's
 
03:37:52.309 --> 03:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
really to uh to make sure that we raise
 
03:37:54.410 --> 03:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
the funds from the insurance carriers
 
03:37:56.809 --> 03:37:56.819 align:start position:0%
that were required to raise by the
 
03:37:59.809 --> 03:37:59.819 align:start position:0%
statute to make sure the department uh
 
03:38:01.610 --> 03:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
can meet their obligations in terms of
 
03:38:06.670 --> 03:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:09.229 --> 03:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for taking my
 
03:38:11.150 --> 03:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
03:38:13.550 --> 03:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to know Natalie
 
03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
allowed direct Primary Care in New
 
03:38:17.809 --> 03:38:17.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how is this going to affect
 
03:38:21.110 --> 03:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
those Physicians who want to who
 
03:38:23.690 --> 03:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
participate in that model of providing
 
03:38:26.269 --> 03:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
health care doesn't this disenfranchise
 
03:38:29.750 --> 03:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
them if this is passed from then
 
03:38:32.450 --> 03:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
um providing vaccinations because they
 
03:38:33.830 --> 03:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
can't for they can only purchase it
 
03:38:35.150 --> 03:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
through the state
 
03:38:37.190 --> 03:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
and they can only
 
03:38:38.809 --> 03:38:38.819 align:start position:0%
they can only do it if they're going
 
03:38:41.750 --> 03:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:44.870 --> 03:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
so I think um if Dr Daley's still on
 
03:38:47.330 --> 03:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
this might be a better question for her
 
03:38:49.429 --> 03:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
but my understanding again what she said
 
03:38:51.349 --> 03:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
earlier too is that it's it's voluntary
 
03:38:53.090 --> 03:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
on the part of the provider to
 
03:38:55.550 --> 03:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
participate um in the program so if they
 
03:38:57.650 --> 03:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
wish to continue to
 
03:38:59.690 --> 03:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
um you know purchase outside
 
03:39:01.190 --> 03:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
um they could do that but they wouldn't
 
03:39:03.710 --> 03:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
be able to be reimbursed for it as my
 
03:39:03.720 --> 03:39:06.050 align:start position:0%
be able to be reimbursed for it as my
understanding

03:39:06.050 --> 03:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
03:39:09.769 --> 03:39:09.779 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any other questions
 
03:39:09.779 --> 03:39:13.990 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any other questions
yes

03:39:13.990 --> 03:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:17.030 --> 03:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman I'll ask
 
03:39:20.150 --> 03:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
you the same question about the cost
 
03:39:23.090 --> 03:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
because it seems like the whole point is
 
03:39:26.150 --> 03:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
to save money so that depends on cutting
 
03:39:29.929 --> 03:39:29.939 align:start position:0%
the cost of the vaccines and that that's
 
03:39:32.090 --> 03:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
making them available to people who
 
03:39:35.690 --> 03:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:38.690 --> 03:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
I wanted to see how to get the cost that
 
03:39:40.309 --> 03:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
we pay now
 
03:39:43.490 --> 03:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
as compared to the cost they are being
 
03:39:43.500 --> 03:39:44.990 align:start position:0%
as compared to the cost they are being
promised

03:39:44.990 --> 03:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
promised
 
03:39:49.550 --> 03:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh if we get the get it from the CDC so
 
03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
I don't want the comparison of the price
 
03:39:54.410 --> 03:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
we pay now to retail I'd like the price
 
03:39:57.050 --> 03:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
we pay now compared to what we
 
03:40:04.010 --> 03:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:06.590 --> 03:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh this is Patrick Miller I'll attempt
 
03:40:08.030 --> 03:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
to answer that
 
03:40:10.910 --> 03:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
um so in terms of the the pricing
 
03:40:13.429 --> 03:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
um again the there is the the difference
 
03:40:15.530 --> 03:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
between the CDC price
 
03:40:17.990 --> 03:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
um and and the retail price
 
03:40:20.450 --> 03:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
um and the providers uh would
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
essentially uh
 
03:40:24.650 --> 03:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
would not be billing you know as they do
 
03:40:27.229 --> 03:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
today for the the vaccine itself they'd
 
03:40:29.990 --> 03:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
only be billing for the administrative
 
03:40:34.309 --> 03:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:34.319 --> 03:40:36.650 align:start position:0%
 
good

03:40:36.650 --> 03:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:40:38.750 --> 03:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking apples and oranges here
 
03:40:42.590 --> 03:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to find out the actual cost
 
03:40:46.370 --> 03:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
of the vaccines that we pay now
 
03:40:49.729 --> 03:40:49.739 align:start position:0%
not the retail compared to the
 
03:40:52.729 --> 03:40:52.739 align:start position:0%
anticipated cost savings if we go
 
03:40:52.739 --> 03:40:53.809 align:start position:0%
anticipated cost savings if we go
through

03:40:53.809 --> 03:40:53.819 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:40:56.269 --> 03:40:56.279 align:start position:0%
this program if we create this program
 
03:41:00.710 --> 03:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
to buy through the CDC retail right so
 
03:41:03.290 --> 03:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
that that's provided that's provided in
 
03:41:05.510 --> 03:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
table five of the insurance Department's
 
03:41:05.520 --> 03:41:06.769 align:start position:0%
table five of the insurance Department's
report

03:41:06.769 --> 03:41:06.779 align:start position:0%
report
 
03:41:08.990 --> 03:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
um where they basically compare buy the
 
03:41:11.210 --> 03:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
different types of vaccines what the
 
03:41:14.210 --> 03:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
average pay per vaccine is because each
 
03:41:16.250 --> 03:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier and PBM will have a
 
03:41:18.349 --> 03:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
different different contract uh
 
03:41:20.330 --> 03:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
relationship with their provider
 
03:41:20.340 --> 03:41:21.590 align:start position:0%
relationship with their provider
networks

03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
networks
 
03:41:23.389 --> 03:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
um and then it also compares the the
 
03:41:26.389 --> 03:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
private sector and then the CDC so that
 
03:41:29.030 --> 03:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
table shows that essentially for all the
 
03:41:31.370 --> 03:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
different vaccines that are listed
 
03:41:33.050 --> 03:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
um the savings if you will between
 
03:41:34.910 --> 03:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
what's currently being paid and then
 
03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
what would be paid
 
03:41:39.530 --> 03:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
I believe I believe that's the table
 
03:41:40.849 --> 03:41:40.859 align:start position:0%
that would answer your question
 
03:41:40.859 --> 03:41:44.450 align:start position:0%
that would answer your question
representative

03:41:44.450 --> 03:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:48.229 --> 03:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:50.809 --> 03:41:50.819 align:start position:0%
um I think what we're looking for is how
 
03:41:52.670 --> 03:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
can we get that form
 
03:41:55.309 --> 03:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
see that information in print do you
 
03:41:59.210 --> 03:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:01.070 --> 03:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
um may I may I speak Mr chair for a
 
03:42:03.290 --> 03:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
moment I sent that out in the packet
 
03:42:04.870 --> 03:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
the report of the New Hampshire
 
03:42:07.790 --> 03:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
insurance department was sent to you in
 
03:42:10.010 --> 03:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
the email by me
 
03:42:11.990 --> 03:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
so that you have that so if you look in
 
03:42:14.750 --> 03:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
your email from me that was one of the
 
03:42:16.550 --> 03:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
documents I sent
 
03:42:18.950 --> 03:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
and the comparison was not between the
 
03:42:21.830 --> 03:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
retail price and the CDC price it was
 
03:42:24.290 --> 03:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
between the price that was paid on
 
03:42:26.630 --> 03:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
claims that's the negotiated price and
 
03:42:30.590 --> 03:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
the CDC price uh so the what Patrick
 
03:42:32.750 --> 03:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
Miller is referring to you have that
 
03:42:34.370 --> 03:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
available to you
 
03:42:36.229 --> 03:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:42:47.510 --> 03:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:49.550 --> 03:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:42:53.630 --> 03:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:55.849 --> 03:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:42:58.370 --> 03:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:58.380 --> 03:42:59.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:42:59.330 --> 03:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:01.130 --> 03:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give us about a 10 minute
 
03:43:01.140 --> 03:43:02.570 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give us about a 10 minute
recess

03:43:02.570 --> 03:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
recess
 
03:43:05.030 --> 03:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
but before I do
 
03:43:07.370 --> 03:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
a couple of announcements
 
03:43:10.610 --> 03:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
number one representative Acton when you
 
03:43:14.809 --> 03:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
write the blurb on HB 378 which we
 
03:43:16.729 --> 03:43:16.739 align:start position:0%
executed last week
 
03:43:20.450 --> 03:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
yes I will send me a copy and one to the
 
03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
clerk thank you on the bill 187
 
03:43:26.630 --> 03:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh is writing
 
03:43:31.510 --> 03:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh positive blurb two people
 
03:43:35.389 --> 03:43:35.399 align:start position:0%
voted against 187 would one of them wish
 
03:43:38.030 --> 03:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
to write The Minority Report or
 
03:43:40.550 --> 03:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
something to say thanks off
 
03:43:42.889 --> 03:43:42.899 align:start position:0%
and forget the other person who told us
 
03:43:42.899 --> 03:43:44.269 align:start position:0%
and forget the other person who told us
no

03:43:44.269 --> 03:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:43:46.370 --> 03:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
it was me
 
03:43:49.490 --> 03:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
03:43:52.010 --> 03:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
um I was extremely ambivalent about my
 
03:43:53.990 --> 03:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
vote and I would certainly defer to
 
03:43:56.809 --> 03:43:56.819 align:start position:0%
representative McKay
 
03:44:00.170 --> 03:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary to have a negative or
 
03:44:02.269 --> 03:44:02.279 align:start position:0%
a Minority Report
 
03:44:04.010 --> 03:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to give you both the
 
03:44:07.010 --> 03:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
option he declines and you don't have to
 
03:44:12.950 --> 03:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:14.870 --> 03:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
I will decline as well
 
03:44:18.469 --> 03:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:18.479 --> 03:44:20.630 align:start position:0%
 
tomorrow

03:44:20.630 --> 03:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
03:44:22.309 --> 03:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
we will meet
 
03:44:27.170 --> 03:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
tucked in snug in everyone's home
 
03:44:32.750 --> 03:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:39.910 --> 03:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:42.530 --> 03:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
February 16th
 
03:44:45.530 --> 03:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
we will meet we have to inject some
 
03:44:49.550 --> 03:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
bills uh because they're early bills
 
03:44:52.790 --> 03:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
and it looks like but it's not a hundred
 
03:44:54.650 --> 03:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
percent confirmed
 
03:44:56.870 --> 03:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
Aaron Goulet was chief of staff and
 
03:45:01.250 --> 03:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
speaker has suggested that date and I'm
 
03:45:03.170 --> 03:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
asking Christina if that could be
 
03:45:05.389 --> 03:45:05.399 align:start position:0%
confirmed by the fourth floor so we'll
 
03:45:05.399 --> 03:45:06.830 align:start position:0%
confirmed by the fourth floor so we'll
know

03:45:06.830 --> 03:45:06.840 align:start position:0%

04:02:15.769 --> 04:02:15.779 align:start position:0%
and Ken remember that this is going out
 
04:02:19.070 --> 04:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
to everybody over the airwaves right
 
04:02:19.849 --> 04:02:19.859 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:02:25.750 --> 04:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:31.450 --> 04:02:31.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:34.010 --> 04:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
are you saying your identities on the
 
04:02:40.250 --> 04:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:42.769 --> 04:02:42.779 align:start position:0%
no was
 
04:02:45.889 --> 04:02:45.899 align:start position:0%
there you go the commission on on opioid
 
04:02:47.150 --> 04:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
deaths you're going to try to go to that
 
04:02:47.160 --> 04:02:49.969 align:start position:0%
deaths you're going to try to go to that
today

04:02:49.969 --> 04:02:49.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:52.010 --> 04:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
um I am going to try although we only
 
04:02:56.590 --> 04:02:56.600 align:start position:0%
have an hour until five o'clock I know
 
04:02:58.910 --> 04:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
I was gonna call the office and see
 
04:03:01.130 --> 04:03:01.140 align:start position:0%
which is more critical I would say the
 
04:03:04.130 --> 04:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
caucus is but anyway so I agree with you
 
04:03:05.929 --> 04:03:05.939 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna go for a little while anyway
 
04:03:08.630 --> 04:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
okay representative snow remember that
 
04:03:11.870 --> 04:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
we may be voting at any time here
 
04:03:13.630 --> 04:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
I know
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
this is the first meeting of this
 
04:03:17.990 --> 04:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
commission that we reported to last
 
04:03:21.290 --> 04:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
August so we at least we I even if we're
 
04:03:23.330 --> 04:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
late well if you're glad we make an
 
04:03:25.189 --> 04:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
appearance I guess that's okay
 
04:03:28.309 --> 04:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
I'm only going to go if this ends oh
 
04:03:30.550 --> 04:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the same thing here I agree
 
04:03:39.410 --> 04:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:42.769 --> 04:03:42.779 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be voting today
 
04:03:42.779 --> 04:03:44.210 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be voting today
anymore

04:03:44.210 --> 04:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
04:03:46.610 --> 04:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
so if somebody has to leave
 
04:03:49.550 --> 04:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
I want you to know that we will not be
 
04:03:52.130 --> 04:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
voting because we're quite a bit behind
 
04:03:54.769 --> 04:03:54.779 align:start position:0%
and representative Solway is texting me
 
04:03:56.929 --> 04:03:56.939 align:start position:0%
every 15 minutes he wants me to leave
 
04:03:58.969 --> 04:03:58.979 align:start position:0%
because he wants me to be saved I
 
04:04:02.090 --> 04:04:02.100 align:start position:0%
appreciate that so with that in mind we
 
04:04:07.189 --> 04:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
are now back on House Bill 604
 
04:04:10.809 --> 04:04:10.819 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Joan
 
04:04:13.610 --> 04:04:13.620 align:start position:0%
and I would say to anybody who's going
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
to be speaking from now on we've heard a
 
04:04:19.429 --> 04:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
lot of testimony all the questions
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
have been asked it could be all the
 
04:04:25.250 --> 04:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
information that could be has been and
 
04:04:28.010 --> 04:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
so each speaker on the rest of this bill
 
04:04:30.229 --> 04:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
will get one minute
 
04:04:34.490 --> 04:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
I have instructed the technical people
 
04:04:38.389 --> 04:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
to shut off mites at one minute so
 
04:04:41.210 --> 04:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
tell us what you wish to tell us we want
 
04:04:43.309 --> 04:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
everybody to have a chance to have a say
 
04:04:45.710 --> 04:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
but we're running quite behind so the
 
04:04:50.090 --> 04:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:55.670 --> 04:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:11.229 --> 04:05:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:14.689 --> 04:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you can hear me
 
04:05:17.870 --> 04:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:21.410 --> 04:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
hello yes we can hear you great as an
 
04:05:23.330 --> 04:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
elected uh but thank you for hearing me
 
04:05:25.130 --> 04:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
as an elected budget Committee Member in
 
04:05:26.990 --> 04:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
my town we paid close attention to
 
04:05:29.450 --> 04:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
health insurance increases
 
04:05:31.790 --> 04:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
um I oppose this bill because as
 
04:05:33.469 --> 04:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned the costs and increases of
 
04:05:35.689 --> 04:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
administrative costs are borne by the
 
04:05:38.030 --> 04:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
insured and it is not my understanding
 
04:05:39.710 --> 04:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
that a health insurance company is
 
04:05:42.469 --> 04:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
willing to give up that Revenue without
 
04:05:44.750 --> 04:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
trying to find recourse thus resulting
 
04:05:46.729 --> 04:05:46.739 align:start position:0%
in increase of health insurance rates
 
04:05:49.070 --> 04:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
for all of us so therefore I oppose this
 
04:05:53.469 --> 04:05:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:56.150 --> 04:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
you said everything that needed to be
 
04:05:56.160 --> 04:05:57.650 align:start position:0%
you said everything that needed to be
said

04:05:57.650 --> 04:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:05:59.990 --> 04:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
characters so you're my doctor child
 
04:06:04.130 --> 04:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:08.269 --> 04:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:11.689 --> 04:06:11.699 align:start position:0%
that I will close the hearing on 604 we
 
04:06:15.590 --> 04:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
it is it is an early bill
 
04:06:19.849 --> 04:06:19.859 align:start position:0%
and February 16th
 
04:06:22.250 --> 04:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
that's transitive but it sounds pretty
 
04:06:25.250 --> 04:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
good it's a Tuesday
 
04:06:27.349 --> 04:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
the bills that are early have to be done
 
04:06:32.510 --> 04:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:35.450 --> 04:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:35.460 --> 04:06:36.790 align:start position:0%
 
that's

04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:06:40.729 --> 04:06:40.739 align:start position:0%
Bill 103 establishing a dental benefit
 
04:06:45.050 --> 04:06:45.060 align:start position:0%

and
 
04:06:46.800 --> 04:06:49.929 align:start position:0%
and
that's

04:06:49.929 --> 04:06:49.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:52.849 --> 04:06:52.859 align:start position:0%

members of the public
 
04:07:15.110 --> 04:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
for the record I am Joe Shapiro Cheshire
 
04:07:17.450 --> 04:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
16 Keen
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
I come before you today to introduce
 
04:07:23.150 --> 04:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill 103 a bill that establishes a
 
04:07:24.950 --> 04:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
dental benefit for adult Medicaid
 
04:07:24.960 --> 04:07:26.389 align:start position:0%
dental benefit for adult Medicaid
recipients

04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
recipients
 
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
in order to explain the specific need
 
04:07:32.090 --> 04:07:32.100 align:start position:0%
for HB 103 and what it entails it will
 
04:07:33.590 --> 04:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
be necessary to give you a little
 
04:07:33.600 --> 04:07:35.630 align:start position:0%
be necessary to give you a little
history

04:07:35.630 --> 04:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
history
 
04:07:38.090 --> 04:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
before I do however let me be clear
 
04:07:40.910 --> 04:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
about the issue before us while dental
 
04:07:43.429 --> 04:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
coverage for children on Medicaid is
 
04:07:46.010 --> 04:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
guaranteed under federal law coverage
 
04:07:49.550 --> 04:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
for adults is a state prerogative in New
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a low-income adult recipients
 
04:07:54.889 --> 04:07:54.899 align:start position:0%
receive no meaningful benefits that
 
04:07:57.229 --> 04:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
means when they have a toothache and the
 
04:07:59.689 --> 04:07:59.699 align:start position:0%
pain becomes unbearable they have no
 
04:08:01.370 --> 04:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
option except to go to their local
 
04:08:03.950 --> 04:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
emergency room where they may be offered
 
04:08:05.469 --> 04:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
pain medication
 
04:08:09.290 --> 04:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
antibiotics or frequently extraction
 
04:08:12.110 --> 04:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
there is no treatment no help for the
 
04:08:14.929 --> 04:08:14.939 align:start position:0%
root cause of their problem
 
04:08:18.229 --> 04:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
I am well I am well aware that many of
 
04:08:20.450 --> 04:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
you here today have been involved in
 
04:08:22.429 --> 04:08:22.439 align:start position:0%
this campaign for access to oral health
 
04:08:25.610 --> 04:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
care for a long time far longer than
 
04:08:29.590 --> 04:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
myself so I will attempt to be brief
 
04:08:31.910 --> 04:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
recognizing poor oral health is a
 
04:08:33.950 --> 04:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
serious Public Health concern the
 
04:08:35.929 --> 04:08:35.939 align:start position:0%
legislature enacted a commission to
 
04:08:38.150 --> 04:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
study Pathways to oral health care in
 
04:08:39.349 --> 04:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:08:43.309 --> 04:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
in November 2015 the commission chaired
 
04:08:46.429 --> 04:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
by Senator Jeb Bradley issued its report
 
04:08:48.769 --> 04:08:48.779 align:start position:0%
noting the link between oral health and
 
04:08:51.530 --> 04:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
overall health the considerable and the
 
04:08:53.630 --> 04:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
considerable challenges to Access Dental
 
04:08:55.750 --> 04:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
Services for low-income people
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
especially those in sparsely populated
 
04:09:00.410 --> 04:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
regions of the state
 
04:09:03.050 --> 04:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
it recommended the establishment of a
 
04:09:07.010 --> 04:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
comprehensive adult Medicaid benefit
 
04:09:09.229 --> 04:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
House Bill 692 established an adult
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid benefit
 
04:09:16.210 --> 04:09:16.220 align:start position:0%
it was passed and signed into law
 
04:09:20.150 --> 04:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
eventually it was rolled into house bill
 
04:09:20.160 --> 04:09:21.910 align:start position:0%
eventually it was rolled into house bill
4

04:09:21.910 --> 04:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
4
 
04:09:24.710 --> 04:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
eventually rolled into house bill 4 it
 
04:09:26.809 --> 04:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
created the adult Dental benefit working
 
04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
group within the Department of Health
 
04:09:30.349 --> 04:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
and Human Services
 
04:09:32.929 --> 04:09:32.939 align:start position:0%
under the leadership of Dr Sarah Finney
 
04:09:34.849 --> 04:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
that group has been meeting to determine
 
04:09:36.830 --> 04:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate levels of care
 
04:09:39.490 --> 04:09:39.500 align:start position:0%
or the actual benefits to be covered
 
04:09:42.530 --> 04:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
delivery models and very importantly
 
04:09:45.229 --> 04:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
cost estimates for implementing such a
 
04:09:45.239 --> 04:09:47.050 align:start position:0%
cost estimates for implementing such a
program

04:09:47.050 --> 04:09:47.060 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:09:49.729 --> 04:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
meanwhile another house bill was passed
 
04:09:51.410 --> 04:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
last year which would have provided the
 
04:09:53.889 --> 04:09:53.899 align:start position:0%
framework and timetable for the actual
 
04:09:56.469 --> 04:09:56.479 align:start position:0%
implementation of dental benefits
 
04:09:59.630 --> 04:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately Governor sununo vetoed
 
04:10:02.510 --> 04:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
that bill in his veto message he cited
 
04:10:04.849 --> 04:10:04.859 align:start position:0%
immediate concerns about covid related
 
04:10:07.610 --> 04:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
budget shortfalls but affirms his
 
04:10:10.429 --> 04:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
General support for a dental plan in
 
04:10:12.050 --> 04:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
fact the morning after this past
 
04:10:14.689 --> 04:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
election responding to a reporter's
 
04:10:17.170 --> 04:10:17.180 align:start position:0%
question about the possibility for
 
04:10:17.180 --> 04:10:18.790 align:start position:0%
question about the possibility for
bipartisans

04:10:18.790 --> 04:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
bipartisans
 
04:10:22.370 --> 04:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
bipartisanship in the next biennium the
 
04:10:24.050 --> 04:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
governor said he was confident that
 
04:10:25.849 --> 04:10:25.859 align:start position:0%
Republicans and Democrats could work
 
04:10:29.929 --> 04:10:29.939 align:start position:0%
together to create a dental benefit
 
04:10:34.130 --> 04:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
so that brings us back to hb103
 
04:10:38.269 --> 04:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
HB 103 is a road map to implementation
 
04:10:41.150 --> 04:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
it will take the excellent work done by
 
04:10:43.849 --> 04:10:43.859 align:start position:0%
the HHS working group and said clear
 
04:10:47.150 --> 04:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
guide posts going forward forward with
 
04:10:49.429 --> 04:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
specific dates
 
04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
the day to put out rfps from managed
 
04:10:55.250 --> 04:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
care companies a day to apply for
 
04:10:59.330 --> 04:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
waivers from centers for Medicare and
 
04:11:02.450 --> 04:11:02.460 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services and most significantly
 
04:11:06.050 --> 04:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
a day to actually Implement coverage
 
04:11:08.689 --> 04:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
it also outlines what benefits will be
 
04:11:08.699 --> 04:11:09.650 align:start position:0%
it also outlines what benefits will be
included

04:11:09.650 --> 04:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
included
 
04:11:11.830 --> 04:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
preventive and restorative Services
 
04:11:15.110 --> 04:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
treatment necessary to relieve pain and
 
04:11:17.630 --> 04:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
prevent imminent tooth loss and then
 
04:11:20.330 --> 04:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
Dentures when necessary
 
04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
there are countless reasons to establish
 
04:11:24.950 --> 04:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
an adult Dental benefit the correlation
 
04:11:26.990 --> 04:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
with other serious and costly medical
 
04:11:27.000 --> 04:11:28.450 align:start position:0%
with other serious and costly medical
conditions

04:11:28.450 --> 04:11:28.460 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
04:11:31.130 --> 04:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
long-term savings related to appropriate
 
04:11:32.689 --> 04:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
treatment rather than repetitive
 
04:11:35.389 --> 04:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
emergency room visits and the
 
04:11:37.849 --> 04:11:37.859 align:start position:0%
disproportionate impact on oral health
 
04:11:40.010 --> 04:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
for those with developmental
 
04:11:42.349 --> 04:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
disabilities and mental illness are just
 
04:11:44.210 --> 04:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
a few of those reasons
 
04:11:47.030 --> 04:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
I will leave these I will leave these
 
04:11:48.710 --> 04:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
issues as well as the specific
 
04:11:50.689 --> 04:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
complexities of rolling out such a
 
04:11:53.330 --> 04:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
program to others who are here to speak
 
04:11:56.990 --> 04:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
and are more knowledgeable than I
 
04:11:59.330 --> 04:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
why you might ask if so much progress
 
04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
has been made a bill has been passed
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
establishing a benefit a DHHS working
 
04:12:06.910 --> 04:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
group is doing its job
 
04:12:10.370 --> 04:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
DHHS has put in a priority need request
 
04:12:14.150 --> 04:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
for funding for the next budget the
 
04:12:16.610 --> 04:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
governor appears to favor this new
 
04:12:19.729 --> 04:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
program why you may ask is the bill even
 
04:12:22.790 --> 04:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
necessary the answer is simple
 
04:12:25.729 --> 04:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
the progress made is real but it is also
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
erratic and unpredictable the reality is
 
04:12:30.950 --> 04:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
that after all these years as we sit
 
04:12:33.769 --> 04:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
here today there are no dental benefits
 
04:12:36.469 --> 04:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
for adult Medicaid recipients instead
 
04:12:38.870 --> 04:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
people are maxing out credit cards to
 
04:12:41.389 --> 04:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
get a root canal or living with chronic
 
04:12:41.399 --> 04:12:42.410 align:start position:0%
get a root canal or living with chronic
pain

04:12:42.410 --> 04:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
pain
 
04:12:44.870 --> 04:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
or having their teeth extracted one by
 
04:12:44.880 --> 04:12:45.889 align:start position:0%
or having their teeth extracted one by
one

04:12:45.889 --> 04:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:12:49.610 --> 04:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
passing hb103 will ensure that within a
 
04:12:52.370 --> 04:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
reasonable time frame a program will be
 
04:12:54.349 --> 04:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
established and our neighbors will be
 
04:12:56.510 --> 04:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
able to have the care that they need and
 
04:12:59.389 --> 04:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
the dignity that they deserve
 
04:13:01.250 --> 04:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you and I am willing to take
 
04:13:01.260 --> 04:13:09.229 align:start position:0%
thank you and I am willing to take
questions

04:13:09.229 --> 04:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:12.349 --> 04:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
the representative Morgan
 
04:13:14.809 --> 04:13:14.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this this is not a
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
question but uh representative Shapiro
 
04:13:18.170 --> 04:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
has been a considerable amount of time
 
04:13:20.809 --> 04:13:20.819 align:start position:0%
talking about costs and funding I would
 
04:13:22.610 --> 04:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion that we have a
 
04:13:24.110 --> 04:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal note prepared for this bill
 
04:13:28.510 --> 04:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:34.010 --> 04:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:37.309 --> 04:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
I I am completely okay with that I think
 
04:13:40.370 --> 04:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
it's necessary I do have a procedural
 
04:13:43.070 --> 04:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
question which is that I have
 
04:13:44.650 --> 04:13:44.660 align:start position:0%
um an amendment
 
04:13:48.349 --> 04:13:48.359 align:start position:0%
that moves the date of implementation
 
04:13:50.750 --> 04:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
which I think would have an effect on
 
04:13:53.030 --> 04:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
the financial note because it moves it
 
04:13:56.150 --> 04:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
further out and the
 
04:13:59.990 --> 04:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
inflated Medicaid population should go
 
04:14:03.769 --> 04:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
down as covid recedes so
 
04:14:06.830 --> 04:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
my procedural question is is it possible
 
04:14:10.729 --> 04:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
to introduce the amendment before we
 
04:14:13.750 --> 04:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
send it for a financial note
 
04:14:15.889 --> 04:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
representative Weber would you help me
 
04:14:19.790 --> 04:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
here please I would Mr chairman my
 
04:14:22.429 --> 04:14:22.439 align:start position:0%
understanding is that they will not
 
04:14:27.110 --> 04:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
prepare a fiscal note
 
04:14:30.170 --> 04:14:30.180 align:start position:0%
um well no actually because the
 
04:14:33.889 --> 04:14:33.899 align:start position:0%
committee is requesting it I think that
 
04:14:35.990 --> 04:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps the thing to do is for the
 
04:14:38.090 --> 04:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
committee to vote to request a fiscal
 
04:14:41.469 --> 04:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
note and for the chairman when he is
 
04:14:44.410 --> 04:14:44.420 align:start position:0%
requesting it on behalf of the committee
 
04:14:49.309 --> 04:14:49.319 align:start position:0%
to let them know that a different date
 
04:14:52.370 --> 04:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
is proposed because
 
04:14:55.130 --> 04:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
um normally they only prepare fiscal
 
04:14:58.370 --> 04:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
notes on uh something that's actually
 
04:14:58.380 --> 04:14:59.990 align:start position:0%
notes on uh something that's actually
passed

04:14:59.990 --> 04:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
passed
 
04:15:02.450 --> 04:15:02.460 align:start position:0%
the committee and I think
 
04:15:04.610 --> 04:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
at least passed the committee and may be
 
04:15:06.650 --> 04:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
adopted by the house after the initial
 
04:15:08.210 --> 04:15:08.220 align:start position:0%
one so
 
04:15:10.729 --> 04:15:10.739 align:start position:0%
I think I think I think if we just vote
 
04:15:12.710 --> 04:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
for one and and
 
04:15:14.510 --> 04:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
if you
 
04:15:16.670 --> 04:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
um let them know that there are two
 
04:15:17.809 --> 04:15:17.819 align:start position:0%
different dates that are being
 
04:15:20.269 --> 04:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
contemplated that would be helpful
 
04:15:22.849 --> 04:15:22.859 align:start position:0%
uh I would like the representative
 
04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
Shapiro a copy of your Amendment email
 
04:15:29.570 --> 04:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
to me so that when I ask for a fiscal
 
04:15:34.130 --> 04:15:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:36.830 --> 04:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I've already emailed it out
 
04:15:38.689 --> 04:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
to everybody but I'll email a copy
 
04:15:42.290 --> 04:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
directly to you thank you very much
 
04:15:44.389 --> 04:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
um representative Weber we need a roll
 
04:15:47.389 --> 04:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
call to do this yes you need a roll call
 
04:15:50.689 --> 04:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
to do everything these days
 
04:15:53.150 --> 04:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
and and and I'm seeing several hands
 
04:15:55.250 --> 04:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
sort of waving I'm not sure if it's in
 
04:15:57.830 --> 04:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
relation to this or something else is
 
04:16:00.170 --> 04:16:00.180 align:start position:0%

04:16:02.570 --> 04:16:02.580 align:start position:0%

04:16:02.580 --> 04:16:04.729 align:start position:0%
I have a question for representative
Shapiro

um and this is a follow-up to the
 
04:16:22.250 --> 04:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
request for a fiscal note representative
 
04:16:24.530 --> 04:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
Shapiro in order to do an intelligent
 
04:16:27.050 --> 04:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it's necessary to have the
 
04:16:29.809 --> 04:16:29.819 align:start position:0%
data we have to know uh if we're going
 
04:16:32.170 --> 04:16:32.180 align:start position:0%
to calculate the impact of this program
 
04:16:34.729 --> 04:16:34.739 align:start position:0%
how many people are out there who will
 
04:16:36.769 --> 04:16:36.779 align:start position:0%
likely to need these Services what the
 
04:16:40.250 --> 04:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
cost of the services are so has Dr
 
04:16:40.260 --> 04:16:41.510 align:start position:0%
cost of the services are so has Dr

Program
 
04:16:49.309 --> 04:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
prepared for you
 
04:16:52.610 --> 04:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
the data describing the number of
 
04:16:56.510 --> 04:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
emergency visits by adult Medicaid
 
04:17:01.610 --> 04:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
recipients for dental treatment do has
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
that department ever given us the data
 
04:17:10.550 --> 04:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:13.610 --> 04:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
I can I can partially answer your
 
04:17:16.250 --> 04:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
question representative sellaway which
 
04:17:17.389 --> 04:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:17:20.090 --> 04:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
um the working group has done a
 
04:17:22.010 --> 04:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of work and they have
 
04:17:24.710 --> 04:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
done all kinds of Actuarial studies
 
04:17:26.929 --> 04:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
related to different
 
04:17:29.330 --> 04:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
different tiers of benefits and how much
 
04:17:32.870 --> 04:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
it will cost and my hope is that um Dr
 
04:17:34.849 --> 04:17:34.859 align:start position:0%
Finney is on this call and she will be
 
04:17:36.349 --> 04:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
able to answer with more of the
 
04:17:36.359 --> 04:17:40.010 align:start position:0%
able to answer with more of the
specifics

04:17:40.010 --> 04:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:44.269 --> 04:17:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:46.490 --> 04:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
um yes Dr Sullivan representative Solway
 
04:17:49.729 --> 04:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
with that in your opinion that data that
 
04:17:53.950 --> 04:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
she might provide would that make the
 
04:17:58.929 --> 04:17:58.939 align:start position:0%
asks for fiscal note more accurate
 
04:18:05.229 --> 04:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:08.150 --> 04:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative Solomon representative
 
04:18:08.160 --> 04:18:10.130 align:start position:0%
representative Solomon representative
Shapiro

04:18:10.130 --> 04:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
Shapiro
 
04:18:10.140 --> 04:18:11.530 align:start position:0%
Shapiro
um

04:18:11.530 --> 04:18:11.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
during if we could
 
04:18:19.610 --> 04:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
approach the request for fiscal drones
 
04:18:22.910 --> 04:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
but with not only your Amendment but
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
with data supplied by Dr Finney in other
 
04:18:27.229 --> 04:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
words let's if we're going to get a
 
04:18:28.910 --> 04:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal milk it should be as accurate as
 
04:18:28.920 --> 04:18:30.309 align:start position:0%
fiscal milk it should be as accurate as
possible

04:18:30.309 --> 04:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
possible
 
04:18:33.889 --> 04:18:33.899 align:start position:0%
could that happen could the two of you
 
04:18:36.469 --> 04:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
speak with each other and so when you
 
04:18:38.450 --> 04:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
send me some things to ask for the
 
04:18:40.250 --> 04:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
04:18:47.389 --> 04:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:51.530 --> 04:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
I if if Dr Finney is not actually on
 
04:18:54.769 --> 04:18:54.779 align:start position:0%
this call and and and does not answer
 
04:18:57.469 --> 04:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
that question for herself I will contact
 
04:18:57.479 --> 04:18:59.150 align:start position:0%
that question for herself I will contact
her

04:18:59.150 --> 04:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
her
 
04:19:01.610 --> 04:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
I mean like she just popped up
 
04:19:04.010 --> 04:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
but I would also just like to take this
 
04:19:06.110 --> 04:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to say that
 
04:19:08.150 --> 04:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
there are
 
04:19:11.870 --> 04:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
I have tremendous up optimism that this
 
04:19:14.090 --> 04:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
benefit will come into being
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
and um but there are an awful lot of
 
04:19:19.070 --> 04:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
moving parts so this fiscal note is one
 
04:19:20.630 --> 04:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
moving part
 
04:19:22.729 --> 04:19:22.739 align:start position:0%
um another moving part is that there's a
 
04:19:25.790 --> 04:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
parallel bill in the Senate
 
04:19:28.250 --> 04:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
um and discussions and um and
 
04:19:31.490 --> 04:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
negotiations there about that bill
 
04:19:34.729 --> 04:19:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
we'll have to take this one step at a
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
time with each of these bills and um
 
04:19:43.250 --> 04:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
make decisions based on what's going to
 
04:19:46.130 --> 04:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
result in the best possible benefit in
 
04:19:47.389 --> 04:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
the long run
 
04:19:50.150 --> 04:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
this is not an early bill
 
04:19:52.429 --> 04:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
so we could bat it around for a little
 
04:19:53.990 --> 04:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
bit and
 
04:19:56.570 --> 04:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
then deferent
 
04:19:59.570 --> 04:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
the further post you know defer the rest
 
04:20:02.990 --> 04:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
of the hearing perhaps until after we
 
04:20:05.929 --> 04:20:05.939 align:start position:0%
see conversations between I would guess
 
04:20:07.790 --> 04:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
that there's a Senate bill on this
 
04:20:10.490 --> 04:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley and the governor
 
04:20:12.889 --> 04:20:12.899 align:start position:0%
um is that amenable to you how would you
 
04:20:14.570 --> 04:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
like us to proceed
 
04:20:16.250 --> 04:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
yes I think there are negotiations
 
04:20:18.769 --> 04:20:18.779 align:start position:0%
between several of the Senators Senator
 
04:20:20.929 --> 04:20:20.939 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald and Senator Bradley and I
 
04:20:23.330 --> 04:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
think that we um
 
04:20:25.910 --> 04:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
it would be wise to not be in a hurry
 
04:20:28.429 --> 04:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
with ex with making a decision about
 
04:20:29.450 --> 04:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:20:31.670 --> 04:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
well then since I cannot start the next
 
04:20:33.650 --> 04:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
hearing until two o'clock we have about
 
04:20:36.889 --> 04:20:36.899 align:start position:0%
a half an hour to get ourselves more and
 
04:20:39.469 --> 04:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
more to speed on the necessity for this
 
04:20:41.990 --> 04:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
and that's I think how I'd like to
 
04:20:42.000 --> 04:20:43.490 align:start position:0%
and that's I think how I'd like to
foresee

04:20:43.490 --> 04:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
foresee
 
04:20:46.189 --> 04:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
uh the chair recognizes Sarah Penny

04:22:48.769 --> 04:22:48.779 align:start position:0%
information you can for them to produce
 
04:22:52.490 --> 04:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note thank you chairman Mr
 
04:22:54.830 --> 04:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
chairman before you recognize the next
 
04:22:54.840 --> 04:22:55.910 align:start position:0%
chairman before you recognize the next
person

04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:23:00.590 --> 04:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:02.630 --> 04:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
04:23:05.750 --> 04:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
yes yes um
 
04:23:09.110 --> 04:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
it when we are all gathered together if
 
04:23:11.510 --> 04:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
one is in the room when the question is
 
04:23:14.330 --> 04:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
put one must vote
 
04:23:19.189 --> 04:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
and because we are not together it seems
 
04:23:23.809 --> 04:23:23.819 align:start position:0%
to me that if one is
 
04:23:23.819 --> 04:23:25.130 align:start position:0%
to me that if one is
um

04:23:25.130 --> 04:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:28.250 --> 04:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
if if one is present to say I don't want
 
04:23:30.309 --> 04:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
to vote on this
 
04:23:34.429 --> 04:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
one was sort of present so if one
 
04:23:38.389 --> 04:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
is not present for voting I think the
 
04:23:41.330 --> 04:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
thing to do would be to simply not
 
04:23:43.189 --> 04:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
answer the clerk has been very clear
 
04:23:46.490 --> 04:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
about calling each person's name twice
 
04:23:49.370 --> 04:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
so if if you were not there when the
 
04:23:51.530 --> 04:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
question was put the thing to do is
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
simply not respond and we don't get into
 
04:23:57.110 --> 04:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
the question of at what point did one
 
04:23:59.750 --> 04:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
come back into the discussion the mouse
 
04:24:02.510 --> 04:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
will be willing to vote please
 
04:24:05.689 --> 04:24:05.699 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not questioning representative
 
04:24:08.750 --> 04:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
Nelson's presence or absence I'm just
 
04:24:12.410 --> 04:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
saying for future for future reference
 
04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
um if if he says he wasn't there he
 
04:24:16.510 --> 04:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't there
 
04:24:18.830 --> 04:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
I thought it would be best that I did
 
04:24:21.290 --> 04:24:21.300 align:start position:0%
not vote In fairness to the sponsor of
 
04:24:23.030 --> 04:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:24:26.650 --> 04:24:26.660 align:start position:0%
your vote will not
 
04:24:30.530 --> 04:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
sufficiently impact the outcome so if
 
04:24:33.290 --> 04:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
you would like to vote fine and if not I
 
04:24:34.610 --> 04:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
didn't see you in the room at the time
 
04:24:36.349 --> 04:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
the question is called
 
04:24:41.469 --> 04:24:41.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:44.990 --> 04:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber
 
04:24:47.929 --> 04:24:47.939 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to recognize Sarah Finney
 
04:24:47.939 --> 04:24:50.510 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to recognize Sarah Finney
please

04:24:50.510 --> 04:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:52.670 --> 04:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon Mr chairman thank you
 
04:24:54.710 --> 04:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
very much for this opportunity to speak
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
to this committee I will certainly do
 
04:25:02.330 --> 04:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
whatever is necessary to create a
 
04:25:04.969 --> 04:25:04.979 align:start position:0%
completely informative fiscal note
 
04:25:08.570 --> 04:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
worksheet for this bill I agree with you
 
04:25:10.550 --> 04:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
all I think that it is very important
 
04:25:14.050 --> 04:25:14.060 align:start position:0%
that there is a clear understanding of
 
04:25:17.330 --> 04:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
the cost estimate for the benefit what
 
04:25:19.210 --> 04:25:19.220 align:start position:0%
the benefit will cover
 
04:25:22.610 --> 04:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
where there can be savings
 
04:25:24.830 --> 04:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
um in in other parts of Medicaid where
 
04:25:27.170 --> 04:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
we're spending money now such as
 
04:25:29.689 --> 04:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
representative saloway mentioned with
 
04:25:32.630 --> 04:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
emergency department costs
 
04:25:34.670 --> 04:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
um so I I look forward to working with
 
04:25:37.070 --> 04:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
you and providing the information that
 
04:25:38.809 --> 04:25:38.819 align:start position:0%
you need so that you can make an
 
04:25:40.429 --> 04:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
informed decision about how to move
 
04:25:42.790 --> 04:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
forward with this bill
 
04:25:44.990 --> 04:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if you have any
 
04:25:49.929 --> 04:25:49.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:53.349 --> 04:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative Mckay please
 
04:25:57.229 --> 04:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
tell us if she is and what her position
 
04:26:00.229 --> 04:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
would you please introduce yourself uh
 
04:26:02.510 --> 04:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
Miss Penny as to who you are your
 
04:26:02.520 --> 04:26:03.590 align:start position:0%
Miss Penny as to who you are your
position

04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
position
 
04:26:06.170 --> 04:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I I apologize for not doing
 
04:26:08.330 --> 04:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
that my name is Dr Sarah Finney I'm a
 
04:26:10.670 --> 04:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
dentist with over 30 years of clinical
 
04:26:13.490 --> 04:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
experience I've been with the Department
 
04:26:16.309 --> 04:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
as a Medicaid dental director for six
 
04:26:18.649 --> 04:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
years now and
 
04:26:20.990 --> 04:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
um I have been leading the work group
 
04:26:24.469 --> 04:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
along with Henry lippman for about 16
 
04:26:27.649 --> 04:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
months now and that work group has done
 
04:26:29.990 --> 04:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
significant work towards defining what
 
04:26:33.410 --> 04:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
the adult Dental benefit would look like
 
04:26:36.170 --> 04:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
Matthew thank you
 
04:26:38.689 --> 04:26:38.699 align:start position:0%
um you were signed up to testify before
 
04:26:41.450 --> 04:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
we looked at the possibility of you
 
04:26:44.170 --> 04:26:44.180 align:start position:0%
working with representative Shapiro
 
04:26:46.969 --> 04:26:46.979 align:start position:0%
would you present the testimony you were
 
04:26:51.649 --> 04:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:53.830 --> 04:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
um the department
 
04:26:56.809 --> 04:26:56.819 align:start position:0%
supports this bill we would like to see
 
04:26:59.269 --> 04:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
there be an adult Dental benefit in
 
04:27:02.149 --> 04:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for all of the reasons that
 
04:27:04.849 --> 04:27:04.859 align:start position:0%
have been spoken about we realize that
 
04:27:07.189 --> 04:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
oral health is integral to overall
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
health there are many areas that we are
 
04:27:14.269 --> 04:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
spending money on other things that are
 
04:27:17.750 --> 04:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
not addressing the root cause of the
 
04:27:20.269 --> 04:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
dental disease and we're trying to put a
 
04:27:23.929 --> 04:27:23.939 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid on those folks who have some
 
04:27:25.490 --> 04:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
serious issues
 
04:27:25.500 --> 04:27:26.630 align:start position:0%
serious issues
um

04:27:26.630 --> 04:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:30.250 --> 04:27:30.260 align:start position:0%
I was going to mention that we did have
 
04:27:34.370 --> 04:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
hb4 signed into law and that the working
 
04:27:36.950 --> 04:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
group had been in process like I said
 
04:27:39.290 --> 04:27:39.300 align:start position:0%
for 16 months now
 
04:27:39.300 --> 04:27:40.790 align:start position:0%
for 16 months now
and

04:27:40.790 --> 04:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:40.800 --> 04:27:41.510 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:27:41.510 --> 04:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
I just think that it is time to try to
 
04:27:47.210 --> 04:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
move this forward what we have to keep
 
04:27:49.309 --> 04:27:49.319 align:start position:0%
in mind though is that there needs to be
 
04:27:51.189 --> 04:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
an appropriation
 
04:27:54.349 --> 04:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
because we need to know that the benefit
 
04:27:58.429 --> 04:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
is going to be funded So currently the
 
04:28:00.590 --> 04:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director Henry lippman has
 
04:28:03.710 --> 04:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
included a priority need request for the
 
04:28:08.389 --> 04:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 22-23 budget that
 
04:28:11.269 --> 04:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
would include the cost of providing this
 
04:28:15.110 --> 04:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
benefit according to a cost estimate
 
04:28:16.490 --> 04:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
that was
 
04:28:23.870 --> 04:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:29.030 --> 04:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:33.469 --> 04:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:35.870 --> 04:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative Morris
 
04:28:38.450 --> 04:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh and thank you
 
04:28:40.969 --> 04:28:40.979 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Dr feiny
 
04:28:43.429 --> 04:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
um uh actually maybe we'll answer two
 
04:28:46.070 --> 04:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
questions for me uh the first is
 
04:28:49.070 --> 04:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
um given the significant increase in
 
04:28:51.110 --> 04:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
potential patients is it going to be
 
04:28:55.250 --> 04:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
sufficient Manpower uh to uh accept
 
04:28:58.370 --> 04:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
these new patients I know and in the
 
04:28:59.929 --> 04:28:59.939 align:start position:0%
medical community there are Physicians
 
04:29:02.929 --> 04:29:02.939 align:start position:0%
who don't take Medicaid Medicaid
 
04:29:04.070 --> 04:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:29:05.809 --> 04:29:05.819 align:start position:0%
um I used to cover Orthopedics for the
 
04:29:08.929 --> 04:29:08.939 align:start position:0%
state hospital and to get dental
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
coverage there was quite difficult
 
04:29:15.170 --> 04:29:15.180 align:start position:0%
um do you have a sense of Manpower uh
 
04:29:17.809 --> 04:29:17.819 align:start position:0%
with this expanded patient load
 
04:29:21.410 --> 04:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
I think that there is uh there is the
 
04:29:23.929 --> 04:29:23.939 align:start position:0%
potential for an adequate provider
 
04:29:27.110 --> 04:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
Network one of the members of the
 
04:29:28.729 --> 04:29:28.739 align:start position:0%
working group is the New Hampshire
 
04:29:30.769 --> 04:29:30.779 align:start position:0%
Dental Society so they have been working
 
04:29:33.290 --> 04:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
alongside everyone else in the work
 
04:29:35.210 --> 04:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
group and we have discussed at Great
 
04:29:37.849 --> 04:29:37.859 align:start position:0%
Lengths what an adequate Network would
 
04:29:40.729 --> 04:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
look like and what we need to look for
 
04:29:44.269 --> 04:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
in the design of this plan but I do feel
 
04:29:46.130 --> 04:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
that there are enough dentists in New
 
04:29:47.929 --> 04:29:47.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that we could have an adequate
 
04:29:47.939 --> 04:29:49.490 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that we could have an adequate
Network

04:29:49.490 --> 04:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
Network
 
04:29:49.500 --> 04:29:51.229 align:start position:0%
Network
uh

04:29:51.229 --> 04:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:29:52.969 --> 04:29:52.979 align:start position:0%
uh well I have another question I'll
 
04:29:56.590 --> 04:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
wait for other people to uh ask first
 
04:30:02.090 --> 04:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:04.309 --> 04:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I don't know if
 
04:30:06.110 --> 04:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
this is directed to representative
 
04:30:08.570 --> 04:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
Shapiro or Dr Finney but I think in
 
04:30:10.429 --> 04:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
addition to all the health benefits that
 
04:30:11.990 --> 04:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
we see I would hope they would agree
 
04:30:16.070 --> 04:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
that the increased employability of
 
04:30:18.050 --> 04:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
Medicaid patients once they have
 
04:30:20.870 --> 04:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
received dental benefits is is a very
 
04:30:23.389 --> 04:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
significant factor in passing this bill
 
04:30:25.969 --> 04:30:25.979 align:start position:0%
toothless waitresses and Toothless sales
 
04:30:28.309 --> 04:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
clerks Etc have a very hard time finding
 
04:30:30.950 --> 04:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
jobs and having that kind of care would
 
04:30:32.450 --> 04:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
certainly increase their employability
 
04:30:37.969 --> 04:30:37.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:46.309 --> 04:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:49.010 --> 04:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair could I ask another question
 
04:30:52.070 --> 04:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
Senate divorce is recognized well thank
 
04:30:53.750 --> 04:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and uh thank you again Dr
 
04:30:53.760 --> 04:30:55.010 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and uh thank you again Dr
Finney

04:30:55.010 --> 04:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
Finney
 
04:30:59.870 --> 04:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
um on page two uh on line 23
 
04:31:02.450 --> 04:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
um it is part of the outlining what
 
04:31:04.849 --> 04:31:04.859 align:start position:0%
services would be included in including
 
04:31:09.769 --> 04:31:09.779 align:start position:0%
smoking sensation cessation counseling
 
04:31:12.290 --> 04:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
uh at least in the medical community and
 
04:31:14.050 --> 04:31:14.060 align:start position:0%
I think for this Committee in the past
 
04:31:17.290 --> 04:31:17.300 align:start position:0%
counseling uh has had a a fairly
 
04:31:20.330 --> 04:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
significant uh and well-described uh
 
04:31:20.340 --> 04:31:22.189 align:start position:0%
significant uh and well-described uh
definition

04:31:22.189 --> 04:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
definition
 
04:31:25.969 --> 04:31:25.979 align:start position:0%
um is that is that word the appropriate
 
04:31:28.010 --> 04:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
word we need there counseling would mean
 
04:31:30.349 --> 04:31:30.359 align:start position:0%
the dentist would then take them under
 
04:31:32.090 --> 04:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
consideration in terms of their medical
 
04:31:34.670 --> 04:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
condition the availability of
 
04:31:37.790 --> 04:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
medications that could would be applied
 
04:31:39.469 --> 04:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
um all of the things that we think of of
 
04:31:41.809 --> 04:31:41.819 align:start position:0%
counseling in a physician's office
 
04:31:43.969 --> 04:31:43.979 align:start position:0%
relative to a particular medical entity
 
04:31:48.290 --> 04:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:50.030 --> 04:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
um I think that this is a good starting
 
04:31:50.040 --> 04:31:51.229 align:start position:0%
um I think that this is a good starting
point

04:31:51.229 --> 04:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:31:54.229 --> 04:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
um what would actually happen is during
 
04:31:57.950 --> 04:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
the process of having an RFI go out
 
04:32:02.090 --> 04:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
prior to an RFP we would be asking some
 
04:32:04.490 --> 04:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
specific questions about how certain
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
care would be delivered and there would
 
04:32:09.769 --> 04:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
we would get more definition under what
 
04:32:13.309 --> 04:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
smoking cessation would include besides
 
04:32:15.410 --> 04:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
counseling and then that would move
 
04:32:21.290 --> 04:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:25.250 --> 04:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:28.250 --> 04:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
um partially we'll we'll watch it as it
 
04:32:30.290 --> 04:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
goes along I have some concerns about
 
04:32:32.389 --> 04:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
the use of that termite I understand
 
04:32:35.149 --> 04:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
that the dentist should be saying uh you
 
04:32:36.889 --> 04:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
you should be stopping your smoking but
 
04:32:38.809 --> 04:32:38.819 align:start position:0%
rather than that individual counseling
 
04:32:41.750 --> 04:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
my surmise would be uh you should you
 
04:32:43.010 --> 04:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
should be in touch with your family
 
04:32:46.010 --> 04:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
doctor or someone like that for uh the
 
04:32:48.469 --> 04:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
best way to do that
 
04:32:51.530 --> 04:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
I agree and I think that what we one of
 
04:32:53.210 --> 04:32:53.220 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:32:55.490 --> 04:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
um one of the other things that we are
 
04:32:58.130 --> 04:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
looking for after much discussion with
 
04:33:00.649 --> 04:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
the work group is making sure that we
 
04:33:03.349 --> 04:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
have integration of the medical plan
 
04:33:06.410 --> 04:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
side with the dental plan and this is a
 
04:33:08.631 --> 04:33:08.641 align:start position:0%
perfect area where the the two need to
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
work together to treat the patient
 
04:33:10.561 --> 04:33:12.650 align:start position:0%
work together to treat the patient
appropriately

04:33:12.650 --> 04:33:12.660 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
04:33:14.929 --> 04:33:14.939 align:start position:0%
I completely agree thank you
 
04:33:16.789 --> 04:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
04:33:18.529 --> 04:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
04:33:20.631 --> 04:33:20.641 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:33:23.269 --> 04:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm a little bit I'm new with
 
04:33:24.590 --> 04:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
04:33:29.150 --> 04:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
and I am surprised that everybody knows
 
04:33:31.429 --> 04:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
smoking's bad for you so I don't think
 
04:33:33.349 --> 04:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
there's any anybody would say there was
 
04:33:35.390 --> 04:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
a problem with trying to get people to
 
04:33:39.410 --> 04:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
stop smoking but in this issue I would
 
04:33:40.849 --> 04:33:40.859 align:start position:0%
expect the
 
04:33:43.310 --> 04:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
people who treat
 
04:33:45.410 --> 04:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
people who treat people for heart
 
04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
disease would be even more interested in
 
04:33:50.029 --> 04:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
getting people to stop smoking it just
 
04:33:52.429 --> 04:33:52.439 align:start position:0%
seems like adding something to the
 
04:33:54.529 --> 04:33:54.539 align:start position:0%
Christmas tree at this point especially
 
04:33:58.250 --> 04:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
when we need to get it paid for to add
 
04:34:01.730 --> 04:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
counseling on top of dental care seems
 
04:34:04.970 --> 04:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
like it's just adding one more cost it
 
04:34:08.330 --> 04:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be right here
 
04:34:10.510 --> 04:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
so somewhere there's a question in there
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
how did y'all decide that smoking
 
04:34:16.730 --> 04:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
cessation counseling or however you
 
04:34:19.070 --> 04:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
treat smoking trying to get people to
 
04:34:21.410 --> 04:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
stop how did you figure it really needs
 
04:34:25.010 --> 04:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:27.109 --> 04:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
um I I would say that the reason that
 
04:34:29.269 --> 04:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
it's very important to be in Dental is
 
04:34:31.551 --> 04:34:31.561 align:start position:0%
that when you visit a dentist part of
 
04:34:34.070 --> 04:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
the examination that we do is an oral
 
04:34:37.970 --> 04:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
cancer exam a screening exam and so if
 
04:34:40.369 --> 04:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
your patients are smokers they are going
 
04:34:43.010 --> 04:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
to be at higher risk of oral cancer and
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
it absolutely fits into what we should
 
04:34:47.929 --> 04:34:47.939 align:start position:0%
be doing as part of our care for our
 
04:34:47.939 --> 04:34:51.890 align:start position:0%
be doing as part of our care for our
patients

04:34:51.890 --> 04:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:51.900 --> 04:34:54.189 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:34:54.189 --> 04:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:57.830 --> 04:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative Folsom thank you chair
 
04:34:59.689 --> 04:34:59.699 align:start position:0%
um thank you for being here and
 
04:35:01.849 --> 04:35:01.859 align:start position:0%

um my question for you is will this
 
04:35:08.029 --> 04:35:08.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:11.750 --> 04:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
dental implants not at the last cost
 
04:35:16.310 --> 04:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:21.650 --> 04:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:23.631 --> 04:35:23.641 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your testimony

yes no I I I had it up for the last
 
04:35:39.170 --> 04:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
question I asked and I'm no longer
 
04:35:41.029 --> 04:35:41.039 align:start position:0%

DHHS

04:36:00.349 --> 04:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:02.990 --> 04:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
04:36:05.330 --> 04:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
of the committee I think Sarah's done a
 
04:36:08.269 --> 04:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
a nice job and answering a lot of the
 
04:36:10.429 --> 04:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
questions about this we have worked with
 
04:36:12.890 --> 04:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
actuaries to develop
 
04:36:15.890 --> 04:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
um several estimates and the most recent
 
04:36:19.490 --> 04:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
one being in August of 2020
 
04:36:22.131 --> 04:36:22.141 align:start position:0%
um part of the estimate addressing
 
04:36:25.010 --> 04:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
representative Woods question about
 
04:36:27.349 --> 04:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
provider network adequacy was an
 
04:36:30.410 --> 04:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
assumption that they would need to be a
 
04:36:32.029 --> 04:36:32.039 align:start position:0%
rate adjustment over current Medicaid
 
04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
levels to get the level of dental
 
04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
participation and that's built into our
 
04:36:40.131 --> 04:36:40.141 align:start position:0%
our cost estimate and I believe with
 
04:36:43.310 --> 04:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
respect to the smoking cessation that
 
04:36:45.529 --> 04:36:45.539 align:start position:0%
smoking cessation is part of the overall
 
04:36:47.810 --> 04:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
Medicaid benefit so I'm not sure it
 
04:36:51.109 --> 04:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
represents an increase in in cost per se
 
04:36:53.929 --> 04:36:53.939 align:start position:0%
but we can come back with that
 
04:37:00.529 --> 04:37:00.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:03.590 --> 04:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
um I think the other issue that I would
 
04:37:07.970 --> 04:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
like to raise is sort of one of timing I
 
04:37:09.650 --> 04:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
think representative Shapiro in
 
04:37:12.289 --> 04:37:12.299 align:start position:0%
introducing the legislation talked about
 
04:37:14.631 --> 04:37:14.641 align:start position:0%
the enrollment
 
04:37:16.369 --> 04:37:16.379 align:start position:0%
um you know enrollment
 
04:37:17.810 --> 04:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
um before the public health emergency
 
04:37:21.369 --> 04:37:21.379 align:start position:0%
was in the Medicaid Program was a
 
04:37:24.289 --> 04:37:24.299 align:start position:0%
17 576
 
04:37:26.869 --> 04:37:26.879 align:start position:0%
000 individuals including about 90 000
 
04:37:26.879 --> 04:37:28.910 align:start position:0%
000 individuals including about 90 000
children

04:37:28.910 --> 04:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:37:32.810 --> 04:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
um today we're probably around 214
 
04:37:35.810 --> 04:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
000 individuals enrolled in Medicaid the
 
04:37:39.490 --> 04:37:39.500 align:start position:0%
largest group that has grown is the um
 
04:37:42.250 --> 04:37:42.260 align:start position:0%
expansion the granite Advantage program
 
04:37:45.529 --> 04:37:45.539 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure whether with all the
 
04:37:47.869 --> 04:37:47.879 align:start position:0%
other budget challenges in terms of we
 
04:37:49.490 --> 04:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
would need to wait for the public health
 
04:37:51.289 --> 04:37:51.299 align:start position:0%
emergency I think to really
 
04:37:51.299 --> 04:37:52.609 align:start position:0%
emergency I think to really
realistically

04:37:52.609 --> 04:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
realistically
 
04:37:52.619 --> 04:37:53.330 align:start position:0%
realistically
um

04:37:53.330 --> 04:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:56.510 --> 04:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
Finance this we have not prepared our
 
04:37:58.250 --> 04:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
cost estimates to this point including
 
04:38:00.289 --> 04:38:00.299 align:start position:0%
that we would do it at the peak of the
 
04:38:05.869 --> 04:38:05.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:07.631 --> 04:38:07.641 align:start position:0%
thank you would you take questions
 
04:38:15.051 --> 04:38:15.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:16.551 --> 04:38:16.561 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
04:38:16.561 --> 04:38:17.689 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
yes

thank you Mr chairman thank you Miss
lippen

04:38:24.289 --> 04:38:24.299 align:start position:0%
lippen
 
04:38:24.299 --> 04:38:24.890 align:start position:0%
lippen
um

04:38:24.890 --> 04:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:24.900 --> 04:38:26.449 align:start position:0%
um
with

04:38:26.449 --> 04:38:26.459 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:38:30.590 --> 04:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid there's a cost sharing with
 
04:38:31.910 --> 04:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
04:38:34.789 --> 04:38:34.799 align:start position:0%
right is it applied to dental benefits
 
04:38:37.670 --> 04:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
as well as to medical and Drug benefits
 
04:38:38.810 --> 04:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:38:41.570 --> 04:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
yes it does um the assumption is for
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
standard Medicaid Program the cost
 
04:38:45.849 --> 04:38:45.859 align:start position:0%
sharing would be 50 and for the
 
04:38:48.529 --> 04:38:48.539 align:start position:0%
expansion granted Advantage Program it
 
04:38:51.590 --> 04:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
would be 90 Federal
 
04:38:54.769 --> 04:38:54.779 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman a follow-up
 
04:38:57.529 --> 04:38:57.539 align:start position:0%
when the fiscal analysis is performed
 
04:38:59.330 --> 04:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
will that also be noted in the physical
 
04:39:02.929 --> 04:39:02.939 align:start position:0%
analysis for us yes it it will be and we
 
04:39:04.789 --> 04:39:04.799 align:start position:0%
have been running it on that basis all
 
04:39:04.799 --> 04:39:06.170 align:start position:0%
have been running it on that basis all
along

04:39:06.170 --> 04:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
along
 
04:39:07.730 --> 04:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:39:10.730 --> 04:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
any further questions for Mr lookman see
 
04:39:13.010 --> 04:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
where I'm sitting I I really barely
 
04:39:15.051 --> 04:39:15.061 align:start position:0%
cannot see folks so what I've been
 
04:39:18.470 --> 04:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
having is people have been texting me uh
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
telling me whose hand is up and I
 
04:39:22.789 --> 04:39:22.799 align:start position:0%
appreciate that when the person doing
 
04:39:24.410 --> 04:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
that is quite busy doing something else
 
04:39:27.289 --> 04:39:27.299 align:start position:0%
I don't always see you so it's it's not
 
04:39:29.510 --> 04:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
out of order for you to ask as
 
04:39:32.570 --> 04:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant just said
 
04:39:39.050 --> 04:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:39.060 --> 04:39:41.350 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

04:39:41.350 --> 04:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:39:44.890 --> 04:39:44.900 align:start position:0%
uh the representative from Salem is
 
04:39:47.390 --> 04:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
recognized for is she quotes it one
 
04:39:49.190 --> 04:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
little bitty question
 
04:39:52.430 --> 04:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
thank you could you repeat the number
 
04:39:55.550 --> 04:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
the cost sharing was it 50 50. all of a
 
04:39:57.590 --> 04:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
sudden I heard a 90 and a 10 somewhere
 
04:40:00.470 --> 04:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
so what's the real number so there are
 
04:40:01.910 --> 04:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
two cost sharing
 
04:40:01.920 --> 04:40:02.750 align:start position:0%
two cost sharing
um

04:40:02.750 --> 04:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:05.630 --> 04:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
situations there's one for people who
 
04:40:07.970 --> 04:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
obtain their eligibility adults say for
 
04:40:10.550 --> 04:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
example someone who has a disability is
 
04:40:12.288 --> 04:40:12.298 align:start position:0%
in the standard Medicaid Program the
 
04:40:14.750 --> 04:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
federal participation is 50 and the
 
04:40:19.070 --> 04:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:21.830 --> 04:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
um in the Medicaid expansion or
 
04:40:23.690 --> 04:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
otherwise known as the granted Advantage
 
04:40:26.270 --> 04:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
Health Care Program in New Hampshire the
 
04:40:28.130 --> 04:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
federal participation would be 90
 
04:40:30.708 --> 04:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
percent and the non-federal share would
 
04:40:35.270 --> 04:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:36.350 --> 04:40:36.360 align:start position:0%

04:40:52.670 --> 04:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:55.130 --> 04:40:55.140 align:start position:0%

04:41:02.510 --> 04:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
new members of this committee hello
 
04:41:03.948 --> 04:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
representative I'm getting a lot of
 
04:41:06.770 --> 04:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
waves which is which is fun to see my
 
04:41:09.708 --> 04:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
name is Polly Campion and I was a recent
 
04:41:12.470 --> 04:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
member of this estimable committee it's
 
04:41:14.690 --> 04:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
a pleasure to see everybody today
 
04:41:17.628 --> 04:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
however I am speaking as a public
 
04:41:21.170 --> 04:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
citizen from the town of Etna and I'd
 
04:41:23.690 --> 04:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
like to very briefly share my support of
 
04:41:25.070 --> 04:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:41:28.850 --> 04:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
as you've heard HB 103 is based on last
 
04:41:31.070 --> 04:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
year's Bill and a history that
 
04:41:33.590 --> 04:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro discussed
 
04:41:36.590 --> 04:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
that HB 250 that was passed in both the
 
04:41:38.570 --> 04:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate and came out of
 
04:41:42.050 --> 04:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
your committee actually unanimously with
 
04:41:44.628 --> 04:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
a vote of ought to pass
 
04:41:46.610 --> 04:41:46.620 align:start position:0%
Governor sununu then vetoed the bill
 
04:41:49.250 --> 04:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
based on anticipated State revenues and
 
04:41:50.930 --> 04:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
there's been much discussion about that
 
04:41:54.410 --> 04:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
to date while he did support the
 
04:41:56.030 --> 04:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
addition of an adult benefit to the
 
04:41:58.430 --> 04:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
state's Medicaid Program
 
04:42:01.190 --> 04:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to share is my perspective
 
04:42:04.010 --> 04:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
as a recent member of the HHS oversight
 
04:42:04.020 --> 04:42:05.030 align:start position:0%
as a recent member of the HHS oversight
committee

04:42:05.030 --> 04:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:42:08.208 --> 04:42:08.218 align:start position:0%
and I think the last committee meeting I
 
04:42:10.850 --> 04:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
attended was in possibly November or
 
04:42:12.530 --> 04:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
December I can't remember frankly at
 
04:42:13.610 --> 04:42:13.620 align:start position:0%
this point
 
04:42:15.890 --> 04:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
but as a member of that committee I had
 
04:42:18.230 --> 04:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to hear regular updates
 
04:42:21.050 --> 04:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
from the working group that has been
 
04:42:23.510 --> 04:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
discussed today and the working group
 
04:42:27.050 --> 04:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
shared with us the fleshing out of
 
04:42:30.110 --> 04:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
specifics of the cost of the number of
 
04:42:34.010 --> 04:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
potential beneficiaries of a range of
 
04:42:37.730 --> 04:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
potential sets of benefits and
 
04:42:41.330 --> 04:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
um Dr Sarah Finney with Mr lippman and
 
04:42:43.850 --> 04:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee did a
 
04:42:45.770 --> 04:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
wonderful job
 
04:42:48.590 --> 04:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
um engaging in an Earnest effort to
 
04:42:48.600 --> 04:42:49.448 align:start position:0%
um engaging in an Earnest effort to
understand

04:42:49.448 --> 04:42:49.458 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:42:52.610 --> 04:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
what might be the best pathway forward
 
04:42:56.448 --> 04:42:56.458 align:start position:0%
to cover the Necessities while making
 
04:42:59.810 --> 04:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
the benefit more affordable to the state
 
04:43:02.650 --> 04:43:02.660 align:start position:0%
and as you've heard there are potential
 
04:43:05.448 --> 04:43:05.458 align:start position:0%
amendments coming forward that may
 
04:43:08.570 --> 04:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
address extending the timeline and
 
04:43:10.430 --> 04:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
potentially describing more explicitly
 
04:43:13.368 --> 04:43:13.378 align:start position:0%
what the covered benefits would be
 
04:43:15.288 --> 04:43:15.298 align:start position:0%
others have spoken about the need to
 
04:43:17.570 --> 04:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
provide Dental Care to New Hampshire's
 
04:43:20.150 --> 04:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable adults the covid-19
 
04:43:22.368 --> 04:43:22.378 align:start position:0%
emergency has resulted in a greater need
 
04:43:25.250 --> 04:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
as more low-income wage earners have
 
04:43:27.830 --> 04:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
lost their jobs and therefore potential
 
04:43:29.628 --> 04:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
health benefits
 
04:43:32.270 --> 04:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
a growing body of evidence exists in an
 
04:43:34.610 --> 04:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
association of poor oral health and
 
04:43:36.830 --> 04:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
chronic health conditions poor dental
 
04:43:39.470 --> 04:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
health and unemployment poor oral health
 
04:43:41.750 --> 04:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
and the use of emergency departments for
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
treatment of dental trauma pain and
 
04:43:44.638 --> 04:43:45.650 align:start position:0%
treatment of dental trauma pain and
infection

04:43:45.650 --> 04:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
infection
 
04:43:48.708 --> 04:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
medical cost offsets are anticipated as
 
04:43:50.810 --> 04:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned as a result of
 
04:43:53.030 --> 04:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
implementation of a dental benefit to
 
04:43:54.830 --> 04:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
those that previously may have accessed
 
04:43:56.810 --> 04:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
emergency care only
 
04:43:58.970 --> 04:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to share
 
04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
this perspective and thank you
 
04:44:04.010 --> 04:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
explicitly to Dr Finney for all of the
 
04:44:05.510 --> 04:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
work that she has LED and to
 
04:44:07.788 --> 04:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro for introducing
 
04:44:10.070 --> 04:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
this bill to help move this critical
 
04:44:11.930 --> 04:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
benefit forward
 
04:44:14.208 --> 04:44:14.218 align:start position:0%
so I asked the committee to vote to move
 
04:44:17.690 --> 04:44:17.700 align:start position:0%

04:44:20.208 --> 04:44:20.218 align:start position:0%
amended if that makes sense and thank

thank you Mr chair and thank you through
 
04:44:52.788 --> 04:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
you to the members uh for the record my
 
04:44:54.170 --> 04:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
name is Michael Auerbach I'm the
 
04:44:55.788 --> 04:44:55.798 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
04:44:59.030 --> 04:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
Dental Society I I'm here today in favor
 
04:45:01.250 --> 04:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
of hb103
 
04:45:03.170 --> 04:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Dental Society is a
 
04:45:05.150 --> 04:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
Statewide organization representing over
 
04:45:07.010 --> 04:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
1100 members of the dental profession
 
04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
including dentists dental hygienists
 
04:45:10.850 --> 04:45:10.860 align:start position:0%
dental assistants and dental practice
 
04:45:14.270 --> 04:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
managers our mission is to advocate for
 
04:45:15.830 --> 04:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
the practice of dentistry and the
 
04:45:17.510 --> 04:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
advancement of the oral health of the
 
04:45:19.550 --> 04:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
public and these two items are not
 
04:45:21.170 --> 04:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
mutually exclusive
 
04:45:23.868 --> 04:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
for many years the nhds has consistently
 
04:45:25.610 --> 04:45:25.620 align:start position:0%
advocated to create an adult Dental
 
04:45:27.470 --> 04:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid benefit
 
04:45:29.570 --> 04:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
the first most important step was the
 
04:45:32.208 --> 04:45:32.218 align:start position:0%
passage of HB 692 and its subsequent
 
04:45:36.770 --> 04:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
iteration hb4 in 2019. of course that
 
04:45:38.628 --> 04:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
bill lacks specific details about what
 
04:45:40.430 --> 04:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
form such a benefit would take in New
 
04:45:42.530 --> 04:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire instead creating the hb4
 
04:45:44.868 --> 04:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
working group which is comprise a
 
04:45:46.190 --> 04:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
committed oral health stakeholders
 
04:45:49.190 --> 04:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
including the nhds and Dr Finney we have
 
04:45:51.050 --> 04:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
since been working diligently with the
 
04:45:52.970 --> 04:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
with the group to give greater structure
 
04:45:55.368 --> 04:45:55.378 align:start position:0%
and scope to this developing benefit
 
04:45:57.470 --> 04:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
we all know that provider participation
 
04:45:59.150 --> 04:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
in the state's Children's Medicaid
 
04:46:01.910 --> 04:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
Program is very low when surveyed in the
 
04:46:04.190 --> 04:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
fall of 2019 our membership identified
 
04:46:06.350 --> 04:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement the lack of care
 
04:46:08.930 --> 04:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
coordination and navigation especially
 
04:46:11.208 --> 04:46:11.218 align:start position:0%
with vulnerable populations and
 
04:46:13.250 --> 04:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
increasing administrative burden as the
 
04:46:14.948 --> 04:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
greatest impediments to participation
 
04:46:17.990 --> 04:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
this bill represents a great first step
 
04:46:20.090 --> 04:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to implement vital
 
04:46:22.750 --> 04:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
patient navigation and case management
 
04:46:25.010 --> 04:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
streamline the system and bring
 
04:46:26.570 --> 04:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates up to National
 
04:46:26.580 --> 04:46:28.310 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates up to National
averages

04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
averages
 
04:46:30.890 --> 04:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
the nhds and other members of the HP4
 
04:46:32.990 --> 04:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
working group concur that an adult
 
04:46:35.690 --> 04:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
Medicaid dental benefit must consider
 
04:46:37.730 --> 04:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
the pent-up need of this population that
 
04:46:40.250 --> 04:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
has persisted for decades perhaps their
 
04:46:42.708 --> 04:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
entire adulthood without Dental without
 
04:46:44.030 --> 04:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
Dental Care
 
04:46:46.670 --> 04:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
achieving oral health may require
 
04:46:49.128 --> 04:46:49.138 align:start position:0%
considerable time and effort from both
 
04:46:51.288 --> 04:46:51.298 align:start position:0%
the provider and the patient we must
 
04:46:53.510 --> 04:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
also consider that some cases may be so
 
04:46:55.610 --> 04:46:55.620 align:start position:0%
significant that removable Prosthetics
 
04:46:57.890 --> 04:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
like dentures and partials may be
 
04:46:59.510 --> 04:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
necessary to Aid in a patient's
 
04:46:59.520 --> 04:47:01.010 align:start position:0%
necessary to Aid in a patient's
employability

04:47:01.010 --> 04:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
employability
 
04:47:03.410 --> 04:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
the nhgs supports the principle of an
 
04:47:05.510 --> 04:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
adult Dental Medicaid benefit and is
 
04:47:07.430 --> 04:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
working diligently with the hb4 working
 
04:47:09.650 --> 04:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
group to make this critical concept a
 
04:47:11.990 --> 04:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
reality for New Hampshire patients we
 
04:47:13.010 --> 04:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
hope that you will take into
 
04:47:15.230 --> 04:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
consideration to conserve the concerns
 
04:47:17.570 --> 04:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
I've just outlined and utilize our
 
04:47:20.030 --> 04:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
dentist's extensive resources and
 
04:47:22.670 --> 04:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
experience as you move to expand the
 
04:47:24.890 --> 04:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
dental benefit to include adults the
 
04:47:26.570 --> 04:47:26.580 align:start position:0%

adult benefit crafted in such a way that
 
04:47:38.208 --> 04:47:38.218 align:start position:0%
it Fosters dentist participation in
 
04:47:40.850 --> 04:47:40.860 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is needed in our state we
 
04:47:44.208 --> 04:47:44.218 align:start position:0%
believe that hb103 is an important step
 
04:47:46.788 --> 04:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
forward in achieving this goal and we
 
04:47:48.350 --> 04:47:48.360 align:start position:0%

recess this hearing to a later date at
 
04:48:10.368 --> 04:48:10.378 align:start position:0%
that point we should know more about
 
04:48:12.288 --> 04:48:12.298 align:start position:0%
what the Senate and the governor are
 
04:48:15.230 --> 04:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
talking about and we should have
 
04:48:18.050 --> 04:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
information for fiscal note but one of

um for the record my name is

04:50:54.110 --> 04:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
um representative Fenton um contact me
 
04:50:55.490 --> 04:50:55.500 align:start position:0%

04:50:56.810 --> 04:50:56.820 align:start position:0%
um just as another another young
 
04:50:56.820 --> 04:50:58.250 align:start position:0%
um just as another another young
representative

04:50:58.250 --> 04:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:50:59.810 --> 04:50:59.820 align:start position:0%
um he outlined that New Hampshire has
 
04:51:01.310 --> 04:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
the second oldest population in the
 
04:51:04.010 --> 04:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
union and because of and perhaps the
 
04:51:05.830 --> 04:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
nation's oldest nursing home population
 
04:51:08.570 --> 04:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
and it's critical that we as legislators
 
04:51:10.610 --> 04:51:10.620 align:start position:0%
can do what we do to make to make sure
 
04:51:13.010 --> 04:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
that no stone is unturned
 
04:51:15.708 --> 04:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
um in protecting our most vulnerable so
 
04:51:17.390 --> 04:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
um just recognizing that the covid
 
04:51:19.128 --> 04:51:19.138 align:start position:0%
crisis has really shown that there are
 
04:51:20.750 --> 04:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
cracks in the system
 
04:51:23.090 --> 04:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
um and it's been stretched although we
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
have tried our best to DHHS and nursing
 
04:51:27.830 --> 04:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
home staff have done a wonderful job
 
04:51:30.170 --> 04:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
um we've still seen 80 of our Cova
 
04:51:32.628 --> 04:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
deaths involve residents in long-term
 
04:51:34.970 --> 04:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
care facilities uh which is over twice
 
04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
the national average we've seen
 
04:51:39.350 --> 04:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
non-medical Staffing crunches including
 
04:51:43.310 --> 04:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
short staff overtime extended overtime
 
04:51:45.650 --> 04:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
and I personally heard from some
 
04:51:46.910 --> 04:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
constituents from the Hillsborough
 
04:51:48.350 --> 04:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
County home that
 
04:51:50.448 --> 04:51:50.458 align:start position:0%
um just staff being burnt out from
 
04:51:53.030 --> 04:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
overwork so uh while they're existing
 
04:51:54.650 --> 04:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
while there is already existing
 
04:51:56.570 --> 04:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
oversight this bill would look at the
 
04:51:56.580 --> 04:51:58.070 align:start position:0%
oversight this bill would look at the
feasibility

04:51:58.070 --> 04:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
feasibility
 
04:52:00.110 --> 04:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
um to have an independent branch of its
 
04:52:02.390 --> 04:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
own category With An Inspector General
 
04:52:03.948 --> 04:52:03.958 align:start position:0%
um that's just in charge of General
 
04:52:06.070 --> 04:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
accountability of our current system
 
04:52:08.868 --> 04:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
regulation and inspection
 
04:52:10.190 --> 04:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
um so we would first of all with this
 
04:52:12.410 --> 04:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
committee study if the position is
 
04:52:13.730 --> 04:52:13.740 align:start position:0%
currently needed given the current
 
04:52:16.910 --> 04:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
system and what independent audits this
 
04:52:18.470 --> 04:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
Inspector General would be responsible
 
04:52:18.480 --> 04:52:19.550 align:start position:0%
Inspector General would be responsible
for

04:52:19.550 --> 04:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:52:22.970 --> 04:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
um in the long-term care facilities so
 
04:52:22.980 --> 04:52:23.750 align:start position:0%
um in the long-term care facilities so
um

04:52:23.750 --> 04:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:26.150 --> 04:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
just to reiterate I think this position
 
04:52:28.730 --> 04:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
could be needed but I'd like to study
 
04:52:30.590 --> 04:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
that further with some Representatives
 
04:52:30.600 --> 04:52:31.610 align:start position:0%
that further with some Representatives
so

04:52:31.610 --> 04:52:31.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:52:33.050 --> 04:52:33.060 align:start position:0%
um with that I would be happy to take
 
04:52:33.060 --> 04:52:34.430 align:start position:0%
um with that I would be happy to take
questions

04:52:34.430 --> 04:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:52:36.410 --> 04:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative
 
04:52:36.420 --> 04:52:39.410 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative
Alexander

04:52:39.410 --> 04:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:42.410 --> 04:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
04:52:45.230 --> 04:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sharon um thank you Mr
 
04:52:47.990 --> 04:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
Alexander representative Alexander um as
 
04:52:50.570 --> 04:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
a nurse who's worked in long-term care
 
04:52:50.580 --> 04:52:52.250 align:start position:0%
a nurse who's worked in long-term care
facilities

04:52:52.250 --> 04:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:52:55.910 --> 04:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
um for quite a while uh we my experience
 
04:52:58.810 --> 04:52:58.820 align:start position:0%
is that we undergo extensive inspections
 
04:53:03.890 --> 04:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
as is and I just don't can you tell me
 
04:53:06.170 --> 04:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
the demonstrated need for a separate
 
04:53:09.170 --> 04:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
paid position
 
04:53:12.708 --> 04:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
um a separate from the inspections that
 
04:53:14.570 --> 04:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
the long-term care facilities all
 
04:53:16.490 --> 04:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
already undergo and
 
04:53:18.470 --> 04:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know aside from them having their
 
04:53:20.750 --> 04:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
own budsmen what is the need for this
 
04:53:20.760 --> 04:53:22.070 align:start position:0%
own budsmen what is the need for this
extra

04:53:22.070 --> 04:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
extra
 
04:53:24.708 --> 04:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
well representative um thank you so much
 
04:53:26.090 --> 04:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
04:53:28.128 --> 04:53:28.138 align:start position:0%
um when I was actually contacted by a
 
04:53:29.570 --> 04:53:29.580 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County Administrator as
 
04:53:30.890 --> 04:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
well that was asking me this very
 
04:53:30.900 --> 04:53:32.208 align:start position:0%
well that was asking me this very
question

04:53:32.208 --> 04:53:32.218 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:53:33.890 --> 04:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
um and I guess I would say that this
 
04:53:35.750 --> 04:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
committee would look at
 
04:53:39.410 --> 04:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
um to what extent this position did but
 
04:53:42.170 --> 04:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
also like we've seen like even with that
 
04:53:45.650 --> 04:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
thorough inspection already we're still
 
04:53:47.448 --> 04:53:47.458 align:start position:0%
seeing problems in the system so I guess
 
04:53:49.730 --> 04:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
having something that the legislature is
 
04:53:51.530 --> 04:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
doing our due diligence to make sure
 
04:53:53.690 --> 04:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
that these people are taking care of the
 
04:53:56.208 --> 04:53:56.218 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable I guess that position if
 
04:53:57.830 --> 04:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
if we determine that that's needed I
 
04:53:57.840 --> 04:53:58.610 align:start position:0%
if we determine that that's needed I
think

04:53:58.610 --> 04:53:58.620 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:53:59.750 --> 04:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
um that's an important thing to spend
 
04:54:01.368 --> 04:54:01.378 align:start position:0%
our money on
 
04:54:05.628 --> 04:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up do not the county
 
04:54:08.050 --> 04:54:08.060 align:start position:0%
commissions which are made up of state
 
04:54:11.868 --> 04:54:11.878 align:start position:0%
legislators already have the ability to
 
04:54:11.878 --> 04:54:16.490 align:start position:0%
legislators already have the ability to
inspect

04:54:16.490 --> 04:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:18.830 --> 04:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
I mean I I believe they do I guess I
 
04:54:20.750 --> 04:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
guess I would say is that
 
04:54:23.150 --> 04:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
um that we are a different body than the
 
04:54:24.830 --> 04:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
County government so
 
04:54:26.330 --> 04:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
um we're doing what we'll do what we can
 
04:54:27.708 --> 04:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
on our side and the county governments
 
04:54:29.030 --> 04:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
can make their decisions for themselves
 
04:54:31.150 --> 04:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
on where their funding goes
 
04:54:36.708 --> 04:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:39.350 --> 04:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you um
 
04:54:41.448 --> 04:54:41.458 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander for taking my
 
04:54:41.458 --> 04:54:42.708 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander for taking my
question

04:54:42.708 --> 04:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:54:42.718 --> 04:54:43.730 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:54:43.730 --> 04:54:43.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:46.128 --> 04:54:46.138 align:start position:0%
I understand that this is
 
04:54:46.138 --> 04:54:47.390 align:start position:0%
I understand that this is
um

04:54:47.390 --> 04:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:49.970 --> 04:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
that this bill really calls for a study
 
04:54:49.980 --> 04:54:50.990 align:start position:0%
that this bill really calls for a study
committee

04:54:50.990 --> 04:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:54:54.288 --> 04:54:54.298 align:start position:0%
um so perhaps reasons why this would be
 
04:54:56.750 --> 04:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
a good idea are premature
 
04:54:59.990 --> 04:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
um but I my question is really why the
 
04:55:02.830 --> 04:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
study committee would be made up
 
04:55:05.150 --> 04:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
exclusively of senators and
 
04:55:06.770 --> 04:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
representatives and not have other
 
04:55:10.310 --> 04:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:11.690 --> 04:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
um well thank you representative for the
 
04:55:12.890 --> 04:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
question so
 
04:55:14.448 --> 04:55:14.458 align:start position:0%
um I've only been on one other study
 
04:55:16.430 --> 04:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
committee but the committee itself has
 
04:55:18.650 --> 04:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
only been legislators and in the
 
04:55:21.110 --> 04:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
legislators would call on others as
 
04:55:23.330 --> 04:55:23.340 align:start position:0%
opposed to a commission which has um
 
04:55:24.890 --> 04:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
different stakeholders on the actual
 
04:55:26.930 --> 04:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
board the legislators are the ones that
 
04:55:30.708 --> 04:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
call witnesses and ask for information
 
04:55:32.270 --> 04:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:55:44.948 --> 04:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:48.050 --> 04:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
representative Weber you recognize to
 
04:55:51.490 --> 04:55:51.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:55.128 --> 04:55:55.138 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr chairman I had my hand up
 
04:55:57.288 --> 04:55:57.298 align:start position:0%
for a question that has been answered so
 
04:55:58.490 --> 04:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:56:01.430 --> 04:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
all right thank you any other questions
 
04:56:07.850 --> 04:56:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:10.788 --> 04:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
seeing none I would like to call on my
 
04:56:14.570 --> 04:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
phone tells me that the prime sponsor uh
 
04:56:18.050 --> 04:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
representative Donovan Fenton is on the
 
04:56:20.448 --> 04:56:20.458 align:start position:0%
call now representative would you like
 
04:56:27.170 --> 04:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:29.390 --> 04:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
my apologies he's not here he was just
 
04:56:31.430 --> 04:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
on the list
 
04:56:34.368 --> 04:56:34.378 align:start position:0%
okay then um
 
04:56:37.970 --> 04:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
Jaya recognizes uh well they've pulled
 
04:56:41.410 --> 04:56:41.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:44.628 --> 04:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
rather than the cheer recognizes Teresa
 
04:56:48.830 --> 04:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:50.990 --> 04:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and good afternoon
 
04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Theresa
 
04:56:55.250 --> 04:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
Rosenberger I work for the law firm of
 
04:56:58.610 --> 04:56:58.620 align:start position:0%
divine excuse me Bernstein Shore and I
 
04:57:00.110 --> 04:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Health Care
 
04:57:02.628 --> 04:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
Association on this bill and the health
 
04:57:05.030 --> 04:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
care Association represents most all of
 
04:57:07.490 --> 04:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
the private nursing homes in the state
 
04:57:11.930 --> 04:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
as well as one of the County homes uh
 
04:57:14.390 --> 04:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
needless to say we're always happy for
 
04:57:17.390 --> 04:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
you all to do study committees and
 
04:57:18.770 --> 04:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
particularly those when looking at
 
04:57:21.010 --> 04:57:21.020 align:start position:0%
appointing An Inspector General
 
04:57:24.890 --> 04:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
however we're not quite sure how this
 
04:57:28.550 --> 04:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
position would fit into the existing
 
04:57:31.730 --> 04:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework for example there's
 
04:57:34.430 --> 04:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
appendix PP of the state operations
 
04:57:37.128 --> 04:57:37.138 align:start position:0%
manual which is guidance to surveyors
 
04:57:41.390 --> 04:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
for long-term care facilities it's 745
 
04:57:43.070 --> 04:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
pages long
 
04:57:45.770 --> 04:57:45.780 align:start position:0%
and it spells out specifically the
 
04:57:47.448 --> 04:57:47.458 align:start position:0%
standards which the nursing homes are
 
04:57:50.930 --> 04:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
held by by the state survey agency uh
 
04:57:52.970 --> 04:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
and uh and and in the case of the
 
04:57:54.470 --> 04:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
nursing homes in New Hampshire that's
 
04:57:55.730 --> 04:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
04:57:58.690 --> 04:57:58.700 align:start position:0%
Services so that's already one oversight
 
04:58:01.788 --> 04:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
04:58:01.798 --> 04:58:02.470 align:start position:0%
there's also
um

04:58:02.470 --> 04:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:05.690 --> 04:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
oversight at the at the federal level
 
04:58:08.690 --> 04:58:08.700 align:start position:0%
and there's an in fact an office of a
 
04:58:11.448 --> 04:58:11.458 align:start position:0%
long-term care Ombudsman which Advocates
 
04:58:14.030 --> 04:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the residents and conducts
 
04:58:17.150 --> 04:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
on-site visits and that does some of the
 
04:58:20.208 --> 04:58:20.218 align:start position:0%
same similar things it's very similar
 
04:58:22.910 --> 04:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
also what DHHS does which is
 
04:58:22.920 --> 04:58:24.110 align:start position:0%
also what DHHS does which is
investigating

04:58:24.110 --> 04:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
investigating
 
04:58:26.750 --> 04:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
um and addressing complaints so I guess
 
04:58:30.230 --> 04:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
our question would be where does it fit
 
04:58:32.150 --> 04:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
into the structure how does it fit into
 
04:58:34.490 --> 04:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
the structure there's tremendous
 
04:58:36.530 --> 04:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
oversight now I will say during the
 
04:58:38.690 --> 04:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
covet crisis the Department of Health
 
04:58:40.670 --> 04:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
and Human Services has been absolutely
 
04:58:43.310 --> 04:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
fabulous to work with needless to say
 
04:58:45.230 --> 04:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
this has been a very stressful situation
 
04:58:47.208 --> 04:58:47.218 align:start position:0%
for the nursing homes but I will say
 
04:58:49.910 --> 04:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
there is not a telephone call that is
 
04:58:52.430 --> 04:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
made that someone that at HHS doesn't
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
respond to and really has been working
 
04:58:58.610 --> 04:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
hand in hand trying as best as possible
 
04:59:01.550 --> 04:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
to deal with this pandemic as well as
 
04:59:03.830 --> 04:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
protect the res residents as well as
 
04:59:06.770 --> 04:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
keeping the nursing homes going so we're
 
04:59:09.170 --> 04:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
more than happy to work on this needless
 
04:59:10.850 --> 04:59:10.860 align:start position:0%
to say the most important thing right
 
04:59:13.850 --> 04:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
now for nursing homes is finding the
 
04:59:16.490 --> 04:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
staff and figuring out how to get the
 
04:59:19.190 --> 04:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
census back up so we can actually have
 
04:59:21.410 --> 04:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
the dollars to keep these nursing homes
 
04:59:23.750 --> 04:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
going it's a really it's a really tough
 
04:59:26.030 --> 04:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
situation at the moment I'm happy to
 
04:59:28.310 --> 04:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
answer any questions I signed up neutral
 
04:59:30.948 --> 04:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
we're happy to participate but also the
 
04:59:33.050 --> 04:59:33.060 align:start position:0%
real question for us is where does this
 
04:59:35.150 --> 04:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
fit in with all the other regulatory
 
04:59:41.390 --> 04:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:44.510 --> 04:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:53.628 --> 04:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:56.208 --> 04:59:56.218 align:start position:0%
and I would like to uh I have one hand
 
04:59:58.670 --> 04:59:58.680 align:start position:0%

05:01:49.128 --> 05:01:49.138 align:start position:0%
inexperienced legislation is the motion
 
05:01:50.530 --> 05:01:50.540 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
05:01:54.830 --> 05:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
of March seconds March 2nd okay now we
 
05:01:56.810 --> 05:01:56.820 align:start position:0%
may discuss
 
05:01:56.820 --> 05:02:03.410 align:start position:0%
may discuss
next

05:02:03.410 --> 05:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:06.770 --> 05:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
uh all right the motion to make this
 
05:02:08.448 --> 05:02:08.458 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill be in expedient to
 
05:02:10.190 --> 05:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
legislative because I think that it is
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
unnecessary it's yeah it's very
 
05:02:12.718 --> 05:02:13.910 align:start position:0%
unnecessary it's yeah it's very
redundant

05:02:13.910 --> 05:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
05:02:16.190 --> 05:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
um we already have the ombudsmans who
 
05:02:18.650 --> 05:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
Advocate on behalf of patients and
 
05:02:21.230 --> 05:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
families we have the county commissions
 
05:02:24.470 --> 05:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
that oversee the nursing homes and can
 
05:02:26.750 --> 05:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
investigate and they work with the
 
05:02:28.250 --> 05:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
05:02:29.810 --> 05:02:29.820 align:start position:0%
um if there's any problems they can go
 
05:02:32.570 --> 05:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
in and with permission and look
 
05:02:34.310 --> 05:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
um and then we have the the state and
 
05:02:37.910 --> 05:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:40.490 --> 05:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Solway
 
05:02:43.788 --> 05:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh I'd like to
 
05:02:46.208 --> 05:02:46.218 align:start position:0%
draw your attention to an interesting
 
05:02:50.990 --> 05:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
contrast this morning we gave our
 
05:02:56.868 --> 05:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
blessing to HB 187 establishing
 
05:03:00.050 --> 05:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
um an oversight over the Commissioner of
 
05:03:02.510 --> 05:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services I thought this
 
05:03:05.750 --> 05:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
was a very responsible thing to do as
 
05:03:10.910 --> 05:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
legislators it is imperative that we uh
 
05:03:10.920 --> 05:03:12.430 align:start position:0%
legislators it is imperative that we uh
provide

05:03:12.430 --> 05:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
provide
 
05:03:17.410 --> 05:03:17.420 align:start position:0%
regulation over uh the executive uh
 
05:03:20.628 --> 05:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
Departments of State Administration okay
 
05:03:23.770 --> 05:03:23.780 align:start position:0%
now we take a look at the nursing homes
 
05:03:26.868 --> 05:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
and we are aware that the nursing homes
 
05:03:28.970 --> 05:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
are inspected by the federal government
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
they are inspected by the state they are
 
05:03:34.070 --> 05:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
in about 50 percent of them in the state
 
05:03:36.530 --> 05:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
actually it's less than that are run by
 
05:03:39.110 --> 05:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
the counties and have County boards that
 
05:03:42.110 --> 05:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
are overseeing them that's a lot of
 
05:03:44.650 --> 05:03:44.660 align:start position:0%
existing oversight
 
05:03:49.910 --> 05:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
the uh imperative for the legislature is
 
05:03:54.250 --> 05:03:54.260 align:start position:0%
to keep state government lean effective
 
05:03:58.610 --> 05:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
agile and I think all of this does is to
 
05:04:03.128 --> 05:04:03.138 align:start position:0%
add a layer of Regulation that repeats
 
05:04:06.170 --> 05:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
sets of regulations that are already in
 
05:04:10.010 --> 05:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
place it will cost in terms of time in
 
05:04:12.170 --> 05:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
terms of money and I don't think it adds
 
05:04:14.628 --> 05:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
anything that isn't already in place and
 
05:04:20.288 --> 05:04:20.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:22.368 --> 05:04:22.378 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
05:04:24.830 --> 05:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair this is representative Marsh I
 
05:04:27.170 --> 05:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
wanted to elaborate on my second yes
 
05:04:29.750 --> 05:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
please yes and I thank representative
 
05:04:31.670 --> 05:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
soloway who stole a great deal of my
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
thunder uh but I wish to also add that
 
05:04:36.590 --> 05:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
the office of the long-term care of
 
05:04:38.690 --> 05:04:38.700 align:start position:0%
bunsman adds yet another layer of
 
05:04:40.128 --> 05:04:40.138 align:start position:0%
accountability in this the most
 
05:04:42.110 --> 05:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
regulated sector of our economy in New
 
05:04:44.390 --> 05:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and therefore I don't think
 
05:04:46.610 --> 05:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
adding yet another layer on top is
 
05:04:46.620 --> 05:04:49.368 align:start position:0%
adding yet another layer on top is
necessary

05:04:49.368 --> 05:04:49.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:51.170 --> 05:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you I would like to hear from
 
05:04:54.470 --> 05:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:54.480 --> 05:04:59.110 align:start position:0%
 
wood

05:04:59.110 --> 05:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:02.628 --> 05:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman Mr representative Merchant
 
05:05:04.368 --> 05:05:04.378 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
05:05:07.070 --> 05:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
I would Echo both representative Marsh
 
05:05:09.170 --> 05:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
in salivate
 
05:05:10.550 --> 05:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
um I see a
 
05:05:12.770 --> 05:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
cost Factor being added on to already
 
05:05:16.310 --> 05:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
burden system with very little if any
 
05:05:19.250 --> 05:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
value proposition to it so I would be
 
05:05:21.350 --> 05:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to it because of those factors
 
05:05:24.288 --> 05:05:24.298 align:start position:0%
we're adding a lot of cost to it with
 
05:05:27.708 --> 05:05:27.718 align:start position:0%
very if any benefit accomplished by it
 
05:05:30.770 --> 05:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:05:34.610 --> 05:05:34.620 align:start position:0%
representative gays thank you thank you
 
05:05:37.368 --> 05:05:37.378 align:start position:0%
for taking my statement this Association
 
05:05:40.128 --> 05:05:40.138 align:start position:0%
of inspectors General that we all got
 
05:05:40.138 --> 05:05:41.448 align:start position:0%
of inspectors General that we all got
emailed

05:05:41.448 --> 05:05:41.458 align:start position:0%
emailed
 
05:05:45.070 --> 05:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
that sounds like they just found a nice
 
05:05:47.810 --> 05:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
representative to do what they want to
 
05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
do which is expand their organization
 
05:05:57.288 --> 05:05:57.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:01.390 --> 05:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:04.010 --> 05:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Weber for
 
05:06:05.288 --> 05:06:05.298 align:start position:0%
point of order
 
05:06:08.150 --> 05:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just going to remind everybody
 
05:06:11.390 --> 05:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
that we do not speculate on other
 
05:06:13.850 --> 05:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
Representatives motivation
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
or or
 
05:06:19.310 --> 05:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
um you know what their motivations are
 
05:06:21.470 --> 05:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
or how they were motivated I think
 
05:06:24.410 --> 05:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
that's that's an unfortunate step in the
 
05:06:25.788 --> 05:06:25.798 align:start position:0%
wrong direction and it's very much
 
05:06:29.208 --> 05:06:29.218 align:start position:0%
against the traditions of the house
 
05:06:31.850 --> 05:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
um you know opposing something is one
 
05:06:33.530 --> 05:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
thing but attributing
 
05:06:36.410 --> 05:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
motivation or or otherwise to a
 
05:06:38.628 --> 05:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
representative is or anyone else for
 
05:06:39.970 --> 05:06:39.980 align:start position:0%
that matter is
 
05:06:39.980 --> 05:06:42.430 align:start position:0%
that matter is
dropper

05:06:42.430 --> 05:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
dropper
 
05:06:45.230 --> 05:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative gay
 
05:06:47.270 --> 05:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
I apologize for
 
05:06:51.948 --> 05:06:51.958 align:start position:0%
I apologize for uh imposing motivation
 
05:06:54.050 --> 05:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
on a representative
 
05:06:59.270 --> 05:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
let's just restrict my my imposition on
 
05:07:05.350 --> 05:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:08.570 --> 05:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
representative Woods
 
05:07:10.430 --> 05:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair
 
05:07:14.750 --> 05:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
um I I too feel that this is not a
 
05:07:16.788 --> 05:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
necessary entity
 
05:07:20.570 --> 05:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
um I have viewed uh nursing homes while
 
05:07:23.990 --> 05:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
I was in practice here in Concord for 34
 
05:07:26.990 --> 05:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
years and used to make rounds at the
 
05:07:31.730 --> 05:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
nursing homes on a monthly basis each
 
05:07:34.310 --> 05:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
one on a monthly basis as well as having
 
05:07:36.410 --> 05:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
family members at different nursing
 
05:07:38.510 --> 05:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
homes and having seen some of the
 
05:07:40.670 --> 05:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
difficulties that they encountered there
 
05:07:43.730 --> 05:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
are currently mechanisms that are
 
05:07:46.910 --> 05:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
available to both the medical side as
 
05:07:49.310 --> 05:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
well as the patient side if there are
 
05:07:49.320 --> 05:07:50.628 align:start position:0%
well as the patient side if there are
difficulties

05:07:50.628 --> 05:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
05:07:52.910 --> 05:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
um it's just a matter of uh like most
 
05:07:55.750 --> 05:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
things being aware and then and then
 
05:07:59.390 --> 05:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
advocating in that particular setting
 
05:08:02.270 --> 05:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
um so I I agree I don't I don't see the
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
necessity at least at this juncture for
 
05:08:07.550 --> 05:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
this entity
 
05:08:09.890 --> 05:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Works anyone
 
05:08:13.788 --> 05:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:16.550 --> 05:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative Shapiro yes sir
 
05:08:16.560 --> 05:08:18.288 align:start position:0%
yes representative Shapiro yes sir
please

05:08:18.288 --> 05:08:18.298 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:08:18.298 --> 05:08:20.150 align:start position:0%
please
um

05:08:20.150 --> 05:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:23.690 --> 05:08:23.700 align:start position:0%
I would just like to say that
 
05:08:25.610 --> 05:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
hopefully this is not a tributing
 
05:08:29.150 --> 05:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
motivation to the sponsors but I would
 
05:08:30.948 --> 05:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
just like to point to their intentions
 
05:08:30.958 --> 05:08:32.330 align:start position:0%
just like to point to their intentions
which

05:08:32.330 --> 05:08:32.340 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:08:34.368 --> 05:08:34.378 align:start position:0%
um I think we would all agree that there
 
05:08:37.730 --> 05:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
were was terrible tragedy in our nursing
 
05:08:40.730 --> 05:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
homes during the past year and
 
05:08:40.740 --> 05:08:42.288 align:start position:0%
homes during the past year and
um

05:08:42.288 --> 05:08:42.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's not to blame it on improper or
 
05:08:48.770 --> 05:08:48.780 align:start position:0%
lacking oversight but I think everybody
 
05:08:50.930 --> 05:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
is struggling with the very high
 
05:08:54.230 --> 05:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
percentage of deaths that occurred
 
05:08:55.610 --> 05:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
within the
 
05:08:58.368 --> 05:08:58.378 align:start position:0%
nursing homes so
 
05:09:01.010 --> 05:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
I would like to vote for this but I
 
05:09:02.510 --> 05:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
would have to agree with all the other
 
05:09:04.128 --> 05:09:04.138 align:start position:0%
people who have spoken that I don't
 
05:09:07.430 --> 05:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
really understand how
 
05:09:07.440 --> 05:09:08.030 align:start position:0%
really understand how
um

05:09:08.030 --> 05:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:10.670 --> 05:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
this is a solution that would add value
 
05:09:13.610 --> 05:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to vote against it
 
05:09:15.590 --> 05:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
someone who hasn't spoken what are your
 
05:09:17.520 --> 05:09:36.010 align:start position:0%
someone who hasn't spoken what are your
thoughts

05:09:36.010 --> 05:09:36.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:39.250 --> 05:09:39.260 align:start position:0%
very good
 
05:09:42.288 --> 05:09:42.298 align:start position:0%
it's not just that I like to hear the
 
05:09:44.570 --> 05:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
thoughts of my colleagues
 
05:09:47.628 --> 05:09:47.638 align:start position:0%
but I'm begging you to speak I'm trying
 
05:09:49.430 --> 05:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
to undo
 
05:09:52.730 --> 05:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
my painting myself into a corner
 
05:09:54.530 --> 05:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
I had
 
05:09:56.868 --> 05:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
said that there would be no votes this
 
05:09:58.670 --> 05:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon meaning if somebody would need
 
05:10:00.530 --> 05:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
to go somewhere you wouldn't be missing
 
05:10:02.810 --> 05:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
anything so what I was trying to do is
 
05:10:04.970 --> 05:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
see if we had a consensus
 
05:10:07.430 --> 05:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
because then one or two people absent
 
05:10:10.190 --> 05:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any difference in the votes
 
05:10:13.550 --> 05:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you for failing me out here
 
05:10:17.208 --> 05:10:17.218 align:start position:0%
representative Canuck is your hand is on
 
05:10:20.030 --> 05:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
yes I just wanted to say that my initial
 
05:10:22.010 --> 05:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
impression in this was that I favored it
 
05:10:23.990 --> 05:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
and I favored it for the idea of being
 
05:10:26.090 --> 05:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
able to bring together all the input of
 
05:10:28.910 --> 05:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
the various other people and and have
 
05:10:30.470 --> 05:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
one person who kind of had some
 
05:10:32.750 --> 05:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility centrally and in
 
05:10:34.490 --> 05:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
particular because we did see also some
 
05:10:37.030 --> 05:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
various some disparities as I understand
 
05:10:39.948 --> 05:10:39.958 align:start position:0%
in terms of response to coveted with
 
05:10:42.470 --> 05:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
infection control uh between different
 
05:10:45.110 --> 05:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
nursing homes however
 
05:10:49.128 --> 05:10:49.138 align:start position:0%
I also am quite open to listening to the
 
05:10:51.530 --> 05:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
very important uh comments made by
 
05:10:53.628 --> 05:10:53.638 align:start position:0%
people who I respect who have made them
 
05:10:55.970 --> 05:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
and they have convinced me that I will
 
05:10:57.890 --> 05:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
actually vote against this even though I
 
05:11:00.230 --> 05:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
initially favored it thank you thank you
 
05:11:04.670 --> 05:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:07.010 --> 05:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yes uh so I would
 
05:11:09.410 --> 05:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
I would say my uh my views on this Echo
 
05:11:11.150 --> 05:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
what we have already heard I think that
 
05:11:12.948 --> 05:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
it adds
 
05:11:15.590 --> 05:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
um unnecessary and unnecessarily
 
05:11:18.890 --> 05:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
additional level of of uh regulation and
 
05:11:21.170 --> 05:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
oversight it's not clear how that would
 
05:11:24.050 --> 05:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
interface with existing oversight and so
 
05:11:26.448 --> 05:11:26.458 align:start position:0%
I would vote in favor of the mass of the
 
05:11:29.150 --> 05:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
motion to uh itl
 
05:11:31.788 --> 05:11:31.798 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Nelson
 
05:11:33.948 --> 05:11:33.958 align:start position:0%

said itl
 
05:11:37.550 --> 05:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:11:41.628 --> 05:11:41.638 align:start position:0%

is to oversee the nursing home and
 
05:11:46.910 --> 05:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
having visited people in the nursing
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
home all my professional life and much
 
05:11:52.788 --> 05:11:52.798 align:start position:0%
of my childhood I do see a lot of
 
05:11:55.850 --> 05:11:55.860 align:start position:0%

all right the next bill is called for
 
05:14:09.410 --> 05:14:09.420 align:start position:0%

go in consent
 
05:14:14.628 --> 05:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
rejection that you could
 
05:14:16.550 --> 05:14:16.560 align:start position:0%

yeah
 
05:14:29.150 --> 05:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative Solway uh Mr chairman a
 
05:14:30.948 --> 05:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
point of personal preference it is
 
05:14:33.770 --> 05:14:33.780 align:start position:0%
nearing 2 30 and in the comfort and
 
05:14:36.230 --> 05:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
warmth of my own home I have been
 
05:14:38.770 --> 05:14:38.780 align:start position:0%
watching the national weather forecast
 
05:14:42.350 --> 05:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh as it pertains to New Hampshire I'd
 
05:14:45.470 --> 05:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
like to point out that uh snow is
 
05:14:48.830 --> 05:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
forecast to begin in Earnest about three
 
05:14:51.948 --> 05:14:51.958 align:start position:0%
o'clock and members of the committee who
 
05:14:55.150 --> 05:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
are in Concord who live in Hillsboro
 
05:14:58.610 --> 05:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
Rockingham and Stratford counties are
 
05:15:00.590 --> 05:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
very likely to encounter snow on the
 
05:15:03.288 --> 05:15:03.298 align:start position:0%
roads as they leave Concord may I
 
05:15:07.670 --> 05:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
respectfully recommend uh that the
 
05:15:11.270 --> 05:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
committee adjourn are going to recess
 
05:15:13.610 --> 05:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
until tomorrow and give people a chance
 
05:15:16.850 --> 05:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
to get home safely
 
05:15:21.948 --> 05:15:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:24.650 --> 05:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
I will just say I don't think we can I
 
05:15:26.628 --> 05:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
would check with the house clerk on this
 
05:15:29.810 --> 05:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
because I have been chastised about it
 
05:15:34.368 --> 05:15:34.378 align:start position:0%
before and I'm not sure how
 
05:15:36.350 --> 05:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
how it came out but
 
05:15:39.230 --> 05:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
I think if we recess today
 
05:15:42.410 --> 05:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
for a hearing scheduled for today
 
05:15:44.930 --> 05:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
I think we have to re-notice it but I'm
 
05:15:47.390 --> 05:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
not sure I think but you would have you
 
05:15:49.010 --> 05:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
would have to check that with the house
 
05:15:52.250 --> 05:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
clerk okay please stand up please stand
 
05:15:52.260 --> 05:16:01.250 align:start position:0%
clerk okay please stand up please stand
by

05:16:01.250 --> 05:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:01.260 --> 05:16:12.230 align:start position:0%
 
Gary

05:16:12.230 --> 05:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:13.670 --> 05:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:16:16.250 --> 05:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
did you have a sandwich yeah okay a
 
05:16:18.708 --> 05:16:18.718 align:start position:0%
question for Christina Christina can you
 
05:16:19.810 --> 05:16:19.820 align:start position:0%
hear me
 
05:16:23.270 --> 05:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative Mark Pearson yes I can
 
05:16:26.570 --> 05:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
uh do we have a lineup of people wanting
 
05:16:31.730 --> 05:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
to testify on uh HB 350.
 
05:16:34.730 --> 05:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
yes we have about 10 people oh wow okay
 
05:16:47.690 --> 05:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:51.050 --> 05:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
could we possibly start early on 350. no
 
05:16:54.170 --> 05:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
we cannot start before
 
05:16:57.050 --> 05:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
that one actually yeah I would like to
 
05:16:58.868 --> 05:16:58.878 align:start position:0%
point out though looking at the forecast
 
05:17:02.690 --> 05:17:02.700 align:start position:0%
for Concord it is not starting heavily
 
05:17:06.590 --> 05:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
it will be starting to snow but the the
 
05:17:10.128 --> 05:17:10.138 align:start position:0%
hourly between uh two o'clock and seven
 
05:17:12.230 --> 05:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
o'clock is only a half an inch
 
05:17:15.050 --> 05:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
five hours half an inch is not going to
 
05:17:16.368 --> 05:17:16.378 align:start position:0%
be a real big problem it's going to be
 
05:17:17.810 --> 05:17:17.820 align:start position:0%
much more than that afterward that's
 
05:17:20.810 --> 05:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
conquered and so I think that even if
 
05:17:22.310 --> 05:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
we're down there
 
05:17:25.250 --> 05:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
if you're down there I'm not I don't
 
05:17:26.690 --> 05:17:26.700 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be that horrendous
 
05:17:28.670 --> 05:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
because this hearing probably shouldn't
 
05:17:30.890 --> 05:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
last that terribly long and it brought
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
it for you should be home before it
 
05:17:34.070 --> 05:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
really hits with the teeth and the that
 
05:17:36.170 --> 05:17:36.180 align:start position:0%
fits with the radar from the projected
 
05:17:39.430 --> 05:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:42.288 --> 05:17:42.298 align:start position:0%
as one of the longer serving members I
 
05:17:44.570 --> 05:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
will say time was we didn't stop for
 
05:17:46.490 --> 05:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
anybody I've had hearings with three
 
05:17:49.910 --> 05:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
committee members available for them but
 
05:17:52.788 --> 05:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
um I understand the concerns that people
 
05:17:54.708 --> 05:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
have about but I think it's for the
 
05:17:56.570 --> 05:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
chairman and the person and people in
 
05:17:58.670 --> 05:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
the room to decide that right and
 
05:18:00.470 --> 05:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
actually if we're not going to vote two
 
05:18:02.208 --> 05:18:02.218 align:start position:0%
people could conceivably say if they're
 
05:18:04.070 --> 05:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
really worried they could leave
 
05:18:06.830 --> 05:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
um if we are guarantee no votes right
 
05:18:10.430 --> 05:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have a a quorum to
 
05:18:13.610 --> 05:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
have the hearing you have to have a
 
05:18:16.670 --> 05:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
quorum to vote and we'll all be here on
 
05:18:18.770 --> 05:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
remote anyway we have a lot of people
 
05:18:18.780 --> 05:18:20.170 align:start position:0%
remote anyway we have a lot of people
here

05:18:20.170 --> 05:18:20.180 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:18:22.850 --> 05:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if I may um with
 
05:18:25.310 --> 05:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative Weber can we hear start
 
05:18:27.708 --> 05:18:27.718 align:start position:0%
the hearing but then recess it although
 
05:18:29.570 --> 05:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
we started it that's what the chair I
 
05:18:31.310 --> 05:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
think is discussing with the clerk right
 
05:18:33.650 --> 05:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
now because I think that I started a
 
05:18:36.470 --> 05:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
hearing on one day and recessed it to
 
05:18:39.770 --> 05:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
the next day and I think I was told very
 
05:18:41.810 --> 05:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
firmly by the clerk that I couldn't do
 
05:18:41.820 --> 05:18:43.128 align:start position:0%
firmly by the clerk that I couldn't do
that

05:18:43.128 --> 05:18:43.138 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:18:46.070 --> 05:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
um although I know very I know that I
 
05:18:50.750 --> 05:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
did do it under a previous regime so I'm
 
05:18:54.288 --> 05:18:54.298 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to either I will give you
 
05:18:56.150 --> 05:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
the official answer or you can continue
 
05:19:00.590 --> 05:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
to guess oh okay you go for it
 
05:19:03.050 --> 05:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if you wish us to continue
 
05:19:05.930 --> 05:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
the hearing remotely and the people in
 
05:19:07.970 --> 05:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
Concord have the opportunity to leave I
 
05:19:09.708 --> 05:19:09.718 align:start position:0%
will be glad to continue the hearing
 
05:19:13.788 --> 05:19:13.798 align:start position:0%
remotely and you can leave if you desire
 
05:19:19.090 --> 05:19:19.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:22.550 --> 05:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
yes sir with all due respect uh those of
 
05:19:24.770 --> 05:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
you who live in what we refer to as the
 
05:19:28.010 --> 05:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
provinces uh need to look at the weather
 
05:19:31.368 --> 05:19:31.378 align:start position:0%
not in Concord but along the Seacoast
 
05:19:34.550 --> 05:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
and in such uh Urban locations as
 
05:19:37.970 --> 05:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
Hampstead in particular uh to figure out
 
05:19:39.650 --> 05:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
if people are going to be at risk on the
 
05:19:40.260 --> 05:19:40.270 align:start position:0%
way home
 
05:19:40.270 --> 05:19:46.270 align:start position:0%
way home
[Laughter]

05:19:46.270 --> 05:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:48.830 --> 05:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could all let our chairman
 
05:19:50.650 --> 05:19:50.660 align:start position:0%
deliver his
 
05:19:50.660 --> 05:19:52.390 align:start position:0%
deliver his
deliberations

05:19:52.390 --> 05:19:52.400 align:start position:0%

05:19:55.690 --> 05:19:55.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:01.670 --> 05:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
who is now a co-author of Masons yeah
 
05:20:05.330 --> 05:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
I must start to hear it at three o'clock
 
05:20:09.350 --> 05:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's right I can recess the here I
 
05:20:11.930 --> 05:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
just can't bail on it
 
05:20:14.270 --> 05:20:14.280 align:start position:0%

it's at home
 
05:20:40.788 --> 05:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
tuning in can continue I I think what I
 
05:20:43.070 --> 05:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
want to do is get the thing going at
 
05:20:45.708 --> 05:20:45.718 align:start position:0%

05:20:48.590 --> 05:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
I'd like to uh go for a while
 
05:20:50.930 --> 05:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
and then recess it get some of this
 
05:20:54.288 --> 05:20:54.298 align:start position:0%
finished we have a few days to do much
 
05:20:54.298 --> 05:20:55.850 align:start position:0%

05:20:59.708 --> 05:20:59.718 align:start position:0%
so miss Mr chairman please
 
05:21:02.868 --> 05:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
there's no penalty or punishment I won't
 
05:21:08.350 --> 05:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:11.030 --> 05:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman uh this is
 
05:21:12.830 --> 05:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh again I will point
 
05:21:15.590 --> 05:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
out that you noticed that this uh uh
 
05:21:17.090 --> 05:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
hearing that we can hold executive
 
05:21:19.070 --> 05:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
session during the day and we now have a
 
05:21:23.150 --> 05:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
half an hour to kill before uh we uh uh
 
05:21:25.070 --> 05:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
can begin the hearing on the next bill
 
05:21:27.170 --> 05:21:27.180 align:start position:0%
so if you have anything you wish to exec
 
05:21:29.030 --> 05:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh you could bring it up at this time
 
05:21:31.510 --> 05:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
but if not we can all chat
 
05:21:34.788 --> 05:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
Weber is that privilege just for bills
 
05:21:37.670 --> 05:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
we've heard today or can we go back from
 
05:21:37.680 --> 05:21:38.810 align:start position:0%
we've heard today or can we go back from
well

05:21:38.810 --> 05:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:21:42.770 --> 05:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
you have that particular notice in the
 
05:21:42.780 --> 05:21:43.570 align:start position:0%
you have that particular notice in the
calendar

05:21:43.570 --> 05:21:43.580 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
05:21:47.390 --> 05:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
I've never liked that notice but
 
05:21:51.410 --> 05:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
that's not my call so you can take up
 
05:21:53.390 --> 05:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
any bill that we have heard at this
 
05:21:53.400 --> 05:21:54.550 align:start position:0%
any bill that we have heard at this
point

05:21:54.550 --> 05:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
point
 
05:21:58.190 --> 05:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
you uh texted me in some consternation
 
05:22:02.030 --> 05:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
some minutes ago because you told people
 
05:22:05.030 --> 05:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
that there would be no more voting today
 
05:22:09.230 --> 05:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
and then we proceeded to take a vote
 
05:22:13.730 --> 05:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
um so that is between you and your
 
05:22:13.740 --> 05:22:15.110 align:start position:0%
um so that is between you and your
conscience

05:22:15.110 --> 05:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
05:22:19.970 --> 05:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
um I think most of us are still here and
 
05:22:22.430 --> 05:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps the thing to do would be to have
 
05:22:24.470 --> 05:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
the clerk go down through the role and
 
05:22:26.330 --> 05:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
just find out how many of us are still
 
05:22:28.788 --> 05:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
here if we're all still here there's
 
05:22:31.310 --> 05:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely no harm no foul for
 
05:22:34.610 --> 05:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
proceeding as as you would and I think
 
05:22:38.510 --> 05:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
you have the right to proceed anyway so
 
05:22:41.830 --> 05:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay but that's up to you
 
05:22:45.708 --> 05:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
okay okay we'll we'll take this in a
 
05:22:48.470 --> 05:22:48.480 align:start position:0%

05:26:12.530 --> 05:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Woods a week enough along
 
05:26:15.050 --> 05:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
on this that we could uh
 
05:26:17.390 --> 05:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
go into an executive session or would
 
05:26:20.330 --> 05:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
you like us to defer someone
 
05:26:22.128 --> 05:26:22.138 align:start position:0%
um uh at this juncture there were a
 
05:26:25.368 --> 05:26:25.378 align:start position:0%
couple questions uh uh from one from
 
05:26:28.190 --> 05:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
um uh representative kovalt and one from
 
05:26:31.070 --> 05:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative uh Cushman and I was
 
05:26:34.128 --> 05:26:34.138 align:start position:0%
trying to look at those and I had a uh
 
05:26:37.730 --> 05:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
conversation uh with HHS and we have a
 
05:26:40.250 --> 05:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
zoom meeting Wednesday morning uh with
 
05:26:43.570 --> 05:26:43.580 align:start position:0%
CDC uh and HH
 
05:26:47.570 --> 05:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire HHS uh to just get
 
05:26:50.090 --> 05:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
definitive clarification of exactly what
 
05:26:53.810 --> 05:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
the terms mean uh which the term that
 
05:26:55.850 --> 05:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
came to mind was I came into question
 
05:26:59.390 --> 05:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
was measures and what that meant uh and
 
05:27:03.830 --> 05:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
what that might imply as far as what uh
 
05:27:06.230 --> 05:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
this would allow the reviews to
 
05:27:08.390 --> 05:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
accomplish uh the second thing was
 
05:27:11.390 --> 05:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
relative to vaccines and relative to
 
05:27:14.750 --> 05:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
what that would imply relative to the
 
05:27:17.570 --> 05:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
administration of those vaccines and
 
05:27:20.868 --> 05:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
whether they're required or not and if
 
05:27:24.890 --> 05:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
so uh yes or no what that would imply uh
 
05:27:27.410 --> 05:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
so I was uh in the process of getting it
 
05:27:29.570 --> 05:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
clarified I can only get a zoom meeting
 
05:27:32.390 --> 05:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
with HHS as earliest I could get was
 
05:27:34.310 --> 05:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
Wednesday morning
 
05:27:34.320 --> 05:27:35.708 align:start position:0%
Wednesday morning
um

05:27:35.708 --> 05:27:35.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:38.868 --> 05:27:38.878 align:start position:0%
so it's not ready for us to to vote on
 
05:27:46.250 --> 05:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:46.260 --> 05:27:52.550 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:27:52.550 --> 05:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:55.430 --> 05:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
what about hb290
 
05:27:57.890 --> 05:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
you mean the one I have in my hand
 
05:27:59.690 --> 05:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
perfect great minds think oh I didn't
 
05:28:01.970 --> 05:28:01.980 align:start position:0%
even have that elbow that I felt
 
05:28:03.830 --> 05:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know without being near each other
 
05:28:05.510 --> 05:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
to Elbow each other they're still doing
 
05:28:06.590 --> 05:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
pretty well
 
05:28:06.600 --> 05:28:09.470 align:start position:0%
pretty well
yeah

05:28:09.470 --> 05:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:12.170 --> 05:28:12.180 align:start position:0%
can I have the sort of a general nod or
 
05:28:14.990 --> 05:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:17.868 --> 05:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
flying by the street here
 
05:28:21.948 --> 05:28:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:24.590 --> 05:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
looks to me from my notes this is not
 
05:28:26.510 --> 05:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
questions it should be regularly
 
05:28:28.670 --> 05:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
disagree but it doesn't look like it
 
05:28:36.170 --> 05:28:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:39.770 --> 05:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
opening a hearing on Niceville 290
 
05:28:42.890 --> 05:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
relative to excuse me I'm opening an
 
05:28:45.830 --> 05:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 290
 
05:28:48.230 --> 05:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
relative to policies required for health
 
05:28:50.030 --> 05:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
facilities and special Healthcare
 
05:28:50.040 --> 05:28:52.730 align:start position:0%
facilities and special Healthcare
licenses

05:28:52.730 --> 05:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
05:29:02.288 --> 05:29:02.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:04.850 --> 05:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
written policy to restore that the
 
05:29:07.430 --> 05:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
facility provides its services to all
 
05:29:10.190 --> 05:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
persons who require the services uh the
 
05:29:12.170 --> 05:29:12.180 align:start position:0%
facility provides regardless of the
 
05:29:14.628 --> 05:29:14.638 align:start position:0%
source of payment the services provided
 
05:29:16.850 --> 05:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
to any person and here's the change
 
05:29:16.860 --> 05:29:18.470 align:start position:0%
to any person and here's the change
unless

05:29:18.470 --> 05:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
unless
 
05:29:20.750 --> 05:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
the facility explicitly provides
 
05:29:22.970 --> 05:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
services to persons who make direct
 
05:29:25.730 --> 05:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
payment for services for the purposes of
 
05:29:27.708 --> 05:29:27.718 align:start position:0%
this paragraph a direct payment is one
 
05:29:30.288 --> 05:29:30.298 align:start position:0%
that is paid directly by the patient
 
05:29:32.990 --> 05:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
not reimbursed or otherwise paid by a
 
05:29:34.850 --> 05:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
third party
 
05:29:37.368 --> 05:29:37.378 align:start position:0%
and the question if you remember in the
 
05:29:39.890 --> 05:29:39.900 align:start position:0%
discussion was uh wouldn't this be
 
05:29:42.110 --> 05:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
skimming off the crane and people who
 
05:29:43.788 --> 05:29:43.798 align:start position:0%
couldn't pay or couldn't pay at all
 
05:29:45.770 --> 05:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
would wind up
 
05:29:48.350 --> 05:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
going only to certain facilities which
 
05:29:50.510 --> 05:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
financially might swamp them that was
 
05:29:53.330 --> 05:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
the General tone of the discussion so
 
05:29:56.208 --> 05:29:56.218 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping for further discussion
 
05:29:59.150 --> 05:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
Meg may I Mr chair yes please
 
05:30:00.948 --> 05:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
representative Canary
 
05:30:03.110 --> 05:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
to initiate the discussion may I move
 
05:30:03.120 --> 05:30:04.368 align:start position:0%
to initiate the discussion may I move
itl

05:30:04.368 --> 05:30:04.378 align:start position:0%
itl
 
05:30:08.090 --> 05:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
you may and I would second it and that
 
05:30:12.530 --> 05:30:12.540 align:start position:0%
was representative Weber yes thank you
 
05:30:14.150 --> 05:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:30:17.208 --> 05:30:17.218 align:start position:0%
okay so there's the there is the uh
 
05:30:19.070 --> 05:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
function on the floor now let's discuss
 
05:30:21.830 --> 05:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
would you like me to my motion
 
05:30:24.530 --> 05:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
yeah continue to representative
 
05:30:27.470 --> 05:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much uh yes I the
 
05:30:30.410 --> 05:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
reason I move itl on this is that it it
 
05:30:32.208 --> 05:30:32.218 align:start position:0%
will do precisely what you were alluding
 
05:30:35.090 --> 05:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
to a moment ago I served on the uh
 
05:30:36.948 --> 05:30:36.958 align:start position:0%
legislative committee with uh Senator
 
05:30:40.128 --> 05:30:40.138 align:start position:0%
Jeff Bradley a year and a half ago in
 
05:30:41.690 --> 05:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
which we were looking at this issue
 
05:30:44.390 --> 05:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
about the impact on critical access
 
05:30:47.750 --> 05:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals of facilities which are
 
05:30:51.470 --> 05:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
um licensed in an act in the somewhere
 
05:30:52.970 --> 05:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
in the area of the critical access
 
05:30:55.128 --> 05:30:55.138 align:start position:0%
hospital and that was for license this
 
05:30:55.138 --> 05:30:56.270 align:start position:0%
hospital and that was for license this
one

05:30:56.270 --> 05:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:30:58.550 --> 05:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
um allows people to just go ahead and
 
05:31:01.190 --> 05:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
just do whatever they want
 
05:31:04.128 --> 05:31:04.138 align:start position:0%
um and I think the problem is that this
 
05:31:07.610 --> 05:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
will skim off the high paying cash
 
05:31:11.030 --> 05:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
customers or people who have uh
 
05:31:12.948 --> 05:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
deductibles but are still paying some
 
05:31:12.958 --> 05:31:14.090 align:start position:0%
deductibles but are still paying some
cash

05:31:14.090 --> 05:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
cash
 
05:31:17.208 --> 05:31:17.218 align:start position:0%
and it will significantly impact our
 
05:31:19.730 --> 05:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals many of them
 
05:31:21.708 --> 05:31:21.718 align:start position:0%
run on margins that are either in the
 
05:31:21.718 --> 05:31:22.430 align:start position:0%
run on margins that are either in the
red

05:31:22.430 --> 05:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
red
 
05:31:25.010 --> 05:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
or barely in the Black by perhaps a half
 
05:31:28.310 --> 05:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
a percent and the we when we looked at
 
05:31:30.110 --> 05:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
this even just the whole idea of an
 
05:31:31.850 --> 05:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
Urgent Care opening somewhere in the
 
05:31:34.670 --> 05:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
vicinity of a critical access Hospital
 
05:31:37.310 --> 05:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
could be a Death Note because as anybody
 
05:31:39.050 --> 05:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
knows a little bit about how we Finance
 
05:31:43.250 --> 05:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh hospitals you don't get a lot of
 
05:31:45.890 --> 05:31:45.900 align:start position:0%
money out of things like labor and
 
05:31:48.050 --> 05:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
delivery because that's mostly Medicaid
 
05:31:49.550 --> 05:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
you don't get a lot of money out of the
 
05:31:51.650 --> 05:31:51.660 align:start position:0%
emergency room visits because they're
 
05:31:54.470 --> 05:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
often uninsured or underpaid and you get
 
05:31:56.830 --> 05:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
it out of the high-paying things such as
 
05:31:59.990 --> 05:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
Orthopedics elective procedures physical
 
05:32:01.550 --> 05:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
exams things like that that are
 
05:32:03.890 --> 05:32:03.900 align:start position:0%
reimbursed better and they subsidize
 
05:32:06.410 --> 05:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
what happens and including also Imaging
 
05:32:08.750 --> 05:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
and all those things so if we allow
 
05:32:10.670 --> 05:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
somebody who says hey you pay cash in
 
05:32:13.850 --> 05:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
the barrel you can come here and no
 
05:32:15.350 --> 05:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
problem and we can be anywhere we want
 
05:32:17.448 --> 05:32:17.458 align:start position:0%
that may have a significant impact on
 
05:32:19.310 --> 05:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
our critical access hospitals which are
 
05:32:21.770 --> 05:32:21.780 align:start position:0%
critical to serve people and the comment
 
05:32:23.830 --> 05:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
was made earlier to day I think about
 
05:32:27.470 --> 05:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
losing for example labor and delivery uh
 
05:32:30.410 --> 05:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
hospitals we have already lost some and
 
05:32:32.510 --> 05:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh if we lose some more it's going to be
 
05:32:34.250 --> 05:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
a real long time and in fact I already
 
05:32:35.990 --> 05:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
understand in Laconia the fire
 
05:32:37.190 --> 05:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
department has delivered many more
 
05:32:40.010 --> 05:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
babies in the last year than what they
 
05:32:42.470 --> 05:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
did in previous years because people
 
05:32:44.330 --> 05:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
can't make it to a hospital in time to
 
05:32:47.330 --> 05:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
have their child so that's the major
 
05:32:50.810 --> 05:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
concern that I have with this bill is
 
05:32:52.670 --> 05:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
that it really is going to negatively
 
05:32:54.770 --> 05:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
impact a lot of our hospitals but
 
05:32:56.810 --> 05:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
particularly critical access hospitals
 
05:32:58.670 --> 05:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
it looks like it really deals with you
 
05:33:00.708 --> 05:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
know lots of facility type of things
 
05:33:04.250 --> 05:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
it's not just a surgery center but that
 
05:33:07.010 --> 05:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
will also be an important impact because
 
05:33:09.770 --> 05:33:09.780 align:start position:0%
if it takes away the surgical
 
05:33:12.830 --> 05:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
um business that eats into the hospital
 
05:33:15.170 --> 05:33:15.180 align:start position:0%
and lastly the comment was made that
 
05:33:16.850 --> 05:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
this money would probably not be tracked
 
05:33:19.730 --> 05:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
in terms of their deductible and so they
 
05:33:21.050 --> 05:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
still would end up having to pay a
 
05:33:23.208 --> 05:33:23.218 align:start position:0%
deductible later for something else I
 
05:33:24.948 --> 05:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
think I understood that part enough
 
05:33:26.390 --> 05:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:33:29.150 --> 05:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber
 
05:33:31.430 --> 05:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman I was going to
 
05:33:33.288 --> 05:33:33.298 align:start position:0%
speak to my second but I think that
 
05:33:35.150 --> 05:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
representative nerk has said everything
 
05:33:37.310 --> 05:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
that needs to be said on the subject so
 
05:33:39.530 --> 05:33:39.540 align:start position:0%
I will just say that I agree with him
 
05:33:41.230 --> 05:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:33:46.250 --> 05:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:49.368 --> 05:33:49.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I believe we did
 
05:33:51.230 --> 05:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
get an email and I don't remember the
 
05:33:53.330 --> 05:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
source that I can't go through I only
 
05:33:55.788 --> 05:33:55.798 align:start position:0%
have one computer so I can't go off here
 
05:33:58.070 --> 05:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
to go look for it but I think it came
 
05:33:59.570 --> 05:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
from someone within the Department of
 
05:34:01.310 --> 05:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services that said
 
05:34:04.070 --> 05:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
there's already a law that states that
 
05:34:06.830 --> 05:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
listing facilities hospitals blah blah
 
05:34:09.288 --> 05:34:09.298 align:start position:0%
blah blah must take care of everybody
 
05:34:11.448 --> 05:34:11.458 align:start position:0%
that comes certain other ones like
 
05:34:13.610 --> 05:34:13.620 align:start position:0%
recovery houses support homes group
 
05:34:16.368 --> 05:34:16.378 align:start position:0%
homes Adult Day Care Home and Community
 
05:34:19.670 --> 05:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
Service Providers and doctor's offices
 
05:34:19.680 --> 05:34:21.288 align:start position:0%
Service Providers and doctor's offices
and

05:34:21.288 --> 05:34:21.298 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:34:23.150 --> 05:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
some kind of clinics
 
05:34:26.208 --> 05:34:26.218 align:start position:0%
do not have to take everybody who walks
 
05:34:26.218 --> 05:34:26.868 align:start position:0%
do not have to take everybody who walks
in

05:34:26.868 --> 05:34:26.878 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:34:29.090 --> 05:34:29.100 align:start position:0%
and so to me it becomes kind of
 
05:34:31.128 --> 05:34:31.138 align:start position:0%
meaningful I mean meaningless I I think
 
05:34:33.708 --> 05:34:33.718 align:start position:0%
it I agree to it should be itl because
 
05:34:35.330 --> 05:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
it just draws attention to the fact that
 
05:34:37.310 --> 05:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
this already laws that allows certain
 
05:34:39.530 --> 05:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
people that should be taking everybody
 
05:34:43.368 --> 05:34:43.378 align:start position:0%
that that comes in and don't come if
 
05:34:44.750 --> 05:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
anything we ought to take a look at that
 
05:34:47.030 --> 05:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
other law and look at ones that should
 
05:34:48.890 --> 05:34:48.900 align:start position:0%
no longer be excluded from having to
 
05:34:53.350 --> 05:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:55.730 --> 05:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh
 
05:34:59.208 --> 05:34:59.218 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh I'm in some
 
05:35:01.070 --> 05:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
ways conflicted because I do support
 
05:35:03.708 --> 05:35:03.718 align:start position:0%
free market Health Care as you know it
 
05:35:05.208 --> 05:35:05.218 align:start position:0%
was my bill it was the direct primary
 
05:35:07.128 --> 05:35:07.138 align:start position:0%
care bill that the sponsors are referred
 
05:35:10.128 --> 05:35:10.138 align:start position:0%
to when they gave their testimony that
 
05:35:12.530 --> 05:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
being said as I said at the hearing I am
 
05:35:16.550 --> 05:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
troubled by the Association of uh uh
 
05:35:18.410 --> 05:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
Hospital bankruptcies enclosures in
 
05:35:20.628 --> 05:35:20.638 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma close to the surgery center of
 
05:35:22.190 --> 05:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma which is the model that this
 
05:35:24.230 --> 05:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
bill would follow and I don't believe
 
05:35:26.990 --> 05:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
that there are adequate protections for
 
05:35:28.550 --> 05:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
such facilities in the state of New
 
05:35:31.250 --> 05:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we've lost enough hospitals
 
05:35:33.050 --> 05:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire already and we
 
05:35:35.750 --> 05:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
certainly don't need to lose more there
 
05:35:37.448 --> 05:35:37.458 align:start position:0%
was a a
 
05:35:40.368 --> 05:35:40.378 align:start position:0%
analogy made between direct primary care
 
05:35:42.650 --> 05:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
and this bill and as I pointed out at
 
05:35:45.350 --> 05:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
the hearing I I don't think that that is
 
05:35:48.590 --> 05:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
quite true uh direct Primary Care pays
 
05:35:51.970 --> 05:35:51.980 align:start position:0%
Physicians on a retainer and in order to
 
05:35:54.350 --> 05:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
have something similar to that for
 
05:35:55.670 --> 05:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
facilities you would have to pay the
 
05:35:57.708 --> 05:35:57.718 align:start position:0%
facilities on a retainer and in many
 
05:35:59.570 --> 05:35:59.580 align:start position:0%
ways we could create a free market
 
05:36:01.430 --> 05:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
system that's very much like Ambulatory
 
05:36:03.470 --> 05:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
Care Organization like accountable care
 
05:36:05.930 --> 05:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
organizations and I think we might find
 
05:36:07.368 --> 05:36:07.378 align:start position:0%
the left and the right meet in the
 
05:36:09.350 --> 05:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
middle if we were to explore that that
 
05:36:12.650 --> 05:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
further so I'm afraid this bill is
 
05:36:14.810 --> 05:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
drafted I will regrettably have to vote
 
05:36:17.030 --> 05:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
in favor of itl
 
05:36:22.850 --> 05:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:25.490 --> 05:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
I miss Mr chairman if I might follow up
 
05:36:27.948 --> 05:36:27.958 align:start position:0%
I looked up in my notes and apparently
 
05:36:29.868 --> 05:36:29.878 align:start position:0%
that that
 
05:36:31.490 --> 05:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that I talked about came
 
05:36:33.230 --> 05:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
from Paula minahan at the New Hampshire
 
05:36:34.850 --> 05:36:34.860 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association
 
05:36:36.490 --> 05:36:36.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
 
05:36:36.500 --> 05:36:38.110 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
representative

05:36:38.110 --> 05:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:36:40.250 --> 05:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
05:36:42.170 --> 05:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:36:44.510 --> 05:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
um I will vote I mean I will speak in
 
05:36:48.050 --> 05:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
opposition to the itl recommendation uh
 
05:36:50.868 --> 05:36:50.878 align:start position:0%
emotion that's on the floor right now
 
05:36:53.750 --> 05:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
um I support this bill as it's written I
 
05:36:55.010 --> 05:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
believe that it will help to drive
 
05:36:59.330 --> 05:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
health care costs Downs costs down
 
05:36:59.340 --> 05:36:59.990 align:start position:0%
health care costs Downs costs down
um

05:36:59.990 --> 05:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:02.390 --> 05:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
by allowing practitioners to only accept
 
05:37:04.368 --> 05:37:04.378 align:start position:0%
direct payment
 
05:37:05.570 --> 05:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
um there will be less administrative
 
05:37:07.448 --> 05:37:07.458 align:start position:0%
costs no need to be under an umbrella
 
05:37:10.250 --> 05:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
reimbursement system
 
05:37:12.530 --> 05:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
um it'll help the gig economy and others
 
05:37:14.868 --> 05:37:14.878 align:start position:0%
who work and people who work in it who
 
05:37:16.730 --> 05:37:16.740 align:start position:0%
don't have traditional employer-based
 
05:37:19.190 --> 05:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
health insurance and may not qualify for
 
05:37:19.200 --> 05:37:20.990 align:start position:0%
health insurance and may not qualify for
Medicaid

05:37:20.990 --> 05:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
05:37:24.410 --> 05:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
um and I believe that it's only can do
 
05:37:26.510 --> 05:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
good things for the healthcare Market in
 
05:37:28.368 --> 05:37:28.378 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and that New Hampshire
 
05:37:31.190 --> 05:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
that closures of hospitals around the
 
05:37:31.200 --> 05:37:32.708 align:start position:0%
that closures of hospitals around the
Oklahoma

05:37:32.708 --> 05:37:32.718 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma
 
05:37:35.150 --> 05:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
facility that offers this kind of
 
05:37:37.730 --> 05:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
service there's no evidence that those
 
05:37:39.530 --> 05:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
closures are directly related to that
 
05:37:41.690 --> 05:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
and we have bankruptcies of hospitals in
 
05:37:44.810 --> 05:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire without this in law so I
 
05:37:46.970 --> 05:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
ask that the others that the committee
 
05:37:49.970 --> 05:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
will vote no on in expedient to
 
05:37:52.030 --> 05:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you very much
 
05:37:55.010 --> 05:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
representative active
 
05:37:57.708 --> 05:37:57.718 align:start position:0%
awesome thank you Mr chair
 
05:38:00.230 --> 05:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
you know I understand both sides of this
 
05:38:03.170 --> 05:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
story here and but it just seems to me
 
05:38:06.590 --> 05:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
that we're we're stifling Innovation to
 
05:38:08.628 --> 05:38:08.638 align:start position:0%
prop up a system that really just isn't
 
05:38:09.948 --> 05:38:09.958 align:start position:0%
working and when hospitals are going
 
05:38:13.070 --> 05:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
into bankruptcy that's a sign of of
 
05:38:14.990 --> 05:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
problems that need to be fixed
 
05:38:17.570 --> 05:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
themselves rather than shutting down in
 
05:38:19.490 --> 05:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
essence creating monopolies for these
 
05:38:22.850 --> 05:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
for these facilities and or for the for
 
05:38:25.550 --> 05:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
the existing traditional hospitals so if
 
05:38:27.890 --> 05:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
someone has um I'm still on the fence
 
05:38:29.510 --> 05:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
here so if someone wants to try to
 
05:38:31.970 --> 05:38:31.980 align:start position:0%
convince me feel free
 
05:38:31.980 --> 05:38:43.208 align:start position:0%
convince me feel free
foreign

05:38:43.208 --> 05:38:43.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:46.910 --> 05:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
policy Guru as much as uh some of the
 
05:38:49.368 --> 05:38:49.378 align:start position:0%
folks uh here uh but I guess my sense
 
05:38:52.070 --> 05:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
would be if this were taken to its
 
05:38:55.430 --> 05:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
extreme let's just pretend that we that
 
05:38:57.890 --> 05:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
would it in fact put us back to the way
 
05:39:00.830 --> 05:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
insurance was the beginning uh there was
 
05:39:03.530 --> 05:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
no direct Contracting uh you had your
 
05:39:06.830 --> 05:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
insurance you got a bill uh you paid it
 
05:39:09.230 --> 05:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
and then you had to get the insurance
 
05:39:12.350 --> 05:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
company to pay you
 
05:39:14.390 --> 05:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
um and it seems like
 
05:39:18.350 --> 05:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
um taking and it's extreme that's where
 
05:39:21.530 --> 05:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
we might end up going I may be wrong but
 
05:39:21.540 --> 05:39:22.490 align:start position:0%
we might end up going I may be wrong but
um

05:39:22.490 --> 05:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:24.530 --> 05:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
um and that that's not where we would
 
05:39:30.770 --> 05:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:38.390 --> 05:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:41.448 --> 05:39:41.458 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if I may presided Merchant
 
05:39:45.110 --> 05:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I support itl I
 
05:39:47.090 --> 05:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
believe at this point
 
05:39:48.650 --> 05:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
um the intent of the bill has some
 
05:39:50.810 --> 05:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
merits to it but the way it's written I
 
05:39:52.670 --> 05:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
think it's problematic
 
05:39:54.830 --> 05:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
um I do believe that right now when he's
 
05:39:57.708 --> 05:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
talking about trying to get a group of
 
05:39:59.330 --> 05:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
providers together to deal with some of
 
05:40:00.830 --> 05:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
the high level cost of things like
 
05:40:03.368 --> 05:40:03.378 align:start position:0%
Hospital costs and so forth I don't know
 
05:40:06.170 --> 05:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
where Primary Care Providers want to get
 
05:40:07.910 --> 05:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
into that Arena to begin with is very
 
05:40:09.948 --> 05:40:09.958 align:start position:0%
costly number two I think it
 
05:40:11.690 --> 05:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh's point of view and
 
05:40:14.090 --> 05:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
some of the other folks here on the call
 
05:40:16.128 --> 05:40:16.138 align:start position:0%
um I do see a slippery slope where we're
 
05:40:18.470 --> 05:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
starting to take some of the
 
05:40:18.480 --> 05:40:19.850 align:start position:0%
starting to take some of the
um

05:40:19.850 --> 05:40:19.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:21.288 --> 05:40:21.298 align:start position:0%
opportunity for some of the critical
 
05:40:22.970 --> 05:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
access hospitals to keep themselves
 
05:40:26.030 --> 05:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
afloat and right now they're on the edge
 
05:40:29.510 --> 05:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
of um going below water financially I
 
05:40:30.890 --> 05:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
think this is going to be a possibility
 
05:40:33.410 --> 05:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
of causing War disruption in that
 
05:40:36.110 --> 05:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
Marketplace and ultimately lead to not
 
05:40:38.270 --> 05:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
having Health Care in some of the Rural
 
05:40:40.670 --> 05:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
America that we need to have so
 
05:40:43.430 --> 05:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
therefore I would spoke to Ideal
 
05:40:48.288 --> 05:40:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:50.208 --> 05:40:50.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:40:52.610 --> 05:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
um so I guess I'd like to start by
 
05:40:54.110 --> 05:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
correcting what I believe is a
 
05:40:57.170 --> 05:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
misconception that came out of the last
 
05:40:59.868 --> 05:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
hearing uh when we were talking about or
 
05:41:01.070 --> 05:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
when someone was talking about
 
05:41:01.080 --> 05:41:02.628 align:start position:0%
when someone was talking about
reimbursement

05:41:02.628 --> 05:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
05:41:07.208 --> 05:41:07.218 align:start position:0%
for those who direct pay would
 
05:41:09.470 --> 05:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
if if they if they're on a high
 
05:41:11.750 --> 05:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
deductibility plan High deductible plan
 
05:41:14.810 --> 05:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
that they would subsequently need to
 
05:41:17.390 --> 05:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
um meet that deductible again
 
05:41:19.070 --> 05:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
um having been in a high deductible plan
 
05:41:20.690 --> 05:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that
 
05:41:23.150 --> 05:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
um whenever our family has direct paid
 
05:41:25.010 --> 05:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
for services
 
05:41:28.070 --> 05:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
um we hold on to those receipts we can
 
05:41:30.590 --> 05:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
submit those to the insurer and they do
 
05:41:32.628 --> 05:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
count towards the deductible
 
05:41:35.948 --> 05:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
um so that's just a a
 
05:41:39.110 --> 05:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
point of fact around around that uh
 
05:41:42.530 --> 05:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
question I guess my you know my concern
 
05:41:44.810 --> 05:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
is that you know we've talked about the
 
05:41:48.350 --> 05:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
the value of free market health care and
 
05:41:51.288 --> 05:41:51.298 align:start position:0%
um you know the the the concern is that
 
05:41:54.530 --> 05:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
direct pay providers are
 
05:41:55.970 --> 05:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
siphoning off
 
05:41:57.948 --> 05:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
the most profitable customers from
 
05:42:00.770 --> 05:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
facilities that will otherwise
 
05:42:04.430 --> 05:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
um be be left with a with a less
 
05:42:07.030 --> 05:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
profitable or unprofitable
 
05:42:09.948 --> 05:42:09.958 align:start position:0%
population that they're serving I guess
 
05:42:11.750 --> 05:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
to me that's a sort of a de facto
 
05:42:13.930 --> 05:42:13.940 align:start position:0%
admission that there is a hidden subsidy
 
05:42:17.510 --> 05:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
built into this and and while I don't
 
05:42:19.788 --> 05:42:19.798 align:start position:0%
believe that we're necessarily going to
 
05:42:23.570 --> 05:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
solve that problem by passing or not
 
05:42:26.690 --> 05:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
passing this bill my concern is that
 
05:42:29.750 --> 05:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
there are forces in play that discourage
 
05:42:32.510 --> 05:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
Innovation and that discourage
 
05:42:32.520 --> 05:42:33.288 align:start position:0%
Innovation and that discourage
um

05:42:33.288 --> 05:42:33.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:36.890 --> 05:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
you know effective Cost Containment and
 
05:42:39.948 --> 05:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
that by encouraging this kind of free
 
05:42:43.670 --> 05:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
choice for for consumers in the
 
05:42:47.330 --> 05:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
healthcare Market as well as encouraging
 
05:42:50.650 --> 05:42:50.660 align:start position:0%
Innovation and competition
 
05:42:53.510 --> 05:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
we are we are encouraging the kind of
 
05:42:56.030 --> 05:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
Cost Containment and an innovation that
 
05:42:58.850 --> 05:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
that ultimately benefits everyone so I
 
05:43:03.410 --> 05:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:07.550 --> 05:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:10.090 --> 05:43:10.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
05:43:13.010 --> 05:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
to speak to representative Acton's
 
05:43:13.020 --> 05:43:15.410 align:start position:0%
to speak to representative Acton's
question

05:43:15.410 --> 05:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:43:17.990 --> 05:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
I think the thing is this
 
05:43:18.000 --> 05:43:18.830 align:start position:0%
I think the thing is this
um

05:43:18.830 --> 05:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:21.770 --> 05:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
if we had a completely free market
 
05:43:24.288 --> 05:43:24.298 align:start position:0%
in medical care we would be back to
 
05:43:27.590 --> 05:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
where we were pre-all of the existing
 
05:43:29.810 --> 05:43:29.820 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations and insurances and
 
05:43:32.448 --> 05:43:32.458 align:start position:0%
everything else and that would mean that
 
05:43:34.190 --> 05:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
people who had money would get care and
 
05:43:35.810 --> 05:43:35.820 align:start position:0%
people who didn't have money would not
 
05:43:37.070 --> 05:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
get care
 
05:43:39.890 --> 05:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going back to that
 
05:43:39.900 --> 05:43:40.550 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going back to that
um

05:43:40.550 --> 05:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:43.070 --> 05:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
some of us would actually like to see
 
05:43:45.170 --> 05:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
Universal Health Care wherein everybody
 
05:43:49.190 --> 05:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
gets care and that's that but I realize
 
05:43:52.490 --> 05:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
that also is not the situation in which
 
05:43:53.628 --> 05:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
we live
 
05:43:58.070 --> 05:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
and may never be who knows but what we
 
05:44:00.708 --> 05:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
have what the way I look at it is we
 
05:44:03.170 --> 05:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
have to deal with the system as it is
 
05:44:03.180 --> 05:44:04.448 align:start position:0%
have to deal with the system as it is
now

05:44:04.448 --> 05:44:04.458 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:44:08.990 --> 05:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
and if we
 
05:44:12.350 --> 05:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
thrust ahead with this Innovation which
 
05:44:14.570 --> 05:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
you know is going to certainly change
 
05:44:16.490 --> 05:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
things in some direction we don't know
 
05:44:16.500 --> 05:44:18.170 align:start position:0%
things in some direction we don't know
what

05:44:18.170 --> 05:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:44:21.590 --> 05:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
um the real risk is taking what we have
 
05:44:23.110 --> 05:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
now which is
 
05:44:26.690 --> 05:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
providing critical care to people who
 
05:44:32.048 --> 05:44:32.058 align:start position:0%
will be with it without it unless we
 
05:44:35.150 --> 05:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
keep some of the current structure until
 
05:44:38.810 --> 05:44:38.820 align:start position:0%
we figure out what to do for the best to
 
05:44:40.730 --> 05:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
replace it
 
05:44:45.590 --> 05:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
um I think I think it for me it's not a
 
05:44:48.650 --> 05:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
great idea to kick one of the props out
 
05:44:50.750 --> 05:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
of a three-legged stool before we've got
 
05:44:53.230 --> 05:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
another prop to put under it
 
05:44:56.750 --> 05:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
so my thought is that
 
05:44:56.760 --> 05:44:57.470 align:start position:0%
so my thought is that
um

05:44:57.470 --> 05:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:57.480 --> 05:45:00.288 align:start position:0%
um
let's

05:45:00.288 --> 05:45:00.298 align:start position:0%
let's
 
05:45:03.288 --> 05:45:03.298 align:start position:0%
keep our critical do everything we can
 
05:45:05.208 --> 05:45:05.218 align:start position:0%
to keep our critical access hospitals
 
05:45:07.910 --> 05:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
going because they are providing very
 
05:45:11.030 --> 05:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
very needed services that are not going
 
05:45:13.788 --> 05:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
to be readily replaced by anybody else
 
05:45:17.990 --> 05:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
because uh they're not the ones that are
 
05:45:20.330 --> 05:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
the most lucrative so that's that's my
 
05:45:20.340 --> 05:45:21.708 align:start position:0%
the most lucrative so that's that's my
plea

05:45:21.708 --> 05:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
plea
 
05:45:24.948 --> 05:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you anyone else which is
 
05:45:27.350 --> 05:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
to speak representative gay thank you Mr
 
05:45:30.948 --> 05:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
chairman I agree with Lucy that uh well
 
05:45:34.490 --> 05:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
I agree with both sides because yes I
 
05:45:36.048 --> 05:45:36.058 align:start position:0%
would like to see the cost of Medical
 
05:45:39.048 --> 05:45:39.058 align:start position:0%
Care drop because as we would take care
 
05:45:41.570 --> 05:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
of our own processing with our insurance
 
05:45:44.628 --> 05:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
the real issue that I've seen ever since
 
05:45:48.048 --> 05:45:48.058 align:start position:0%
my mother went into excuse me the
 
05:45:50.868 --> 05:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
private pay plus Medicaid nursing home
 
05:45:53.270 --> 05:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:45:55.730 --> 05:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
Medicaid simply does not pay enough to
 
05:45:59.150 --> 05:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
keep hospitals open and so right now the
 
05:46:02.270 --> 05:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
way this the fee schedule is if a
 
05:46:05.090 --> 05:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
hospital only has Medicaid
 
05:46:05.100 --> 05:46:06.770 align:start position:0%
hospital only has Medicaid
of

05:46:06.770 --> 05:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:46:09.708 --> 05:46:09.718 align:start position:0%
what's the right word patience it can't
 
05:46:13.610 --> 05:46:13.620 align:start position:0%
it can't stay it just can't make it so
 
05:46:15.708 --> 05:46:15.718 align:start position:0%
we have to come out if we want to change
 
05:46:19.490 --> 05:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
it and cut some costs this will not do
 
05:46:21.830 --> 05:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
it because this will just wipe out the
 
05:46:24.410 --> 05:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
positive slope of money that's keeping
 
05:46:26.750 --> 05:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
the hospitals open so I agree there's a
 
05:46:28.788 --> 05:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
problem I agree we ought to find a
 
05:46:31.910 --> 05:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
solution but right now this is not the
 
05:46:34.868 --> 05:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
solution we'll just stop keeping
 
05:46:37.850 --> 05:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
hospitals open that right now cannot
 
05:46:40.250 --> 05:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
survive on Medicaid
 
05:46:42.650 --> 05:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you representative canark
 
05:46:44.990 --> 05:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
yes I just want to reflect back to some
 
05:46:46.850 --> 05:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
previous comments about getting the free
 
05:46:48.890 --> 05:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
market to work the problem is that
 
05:46:50.628 --> 05:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
Health Care simply doesn't function as a
 
05:46:52.190 --> 05:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
free market Health Care is
 
05:46:55.070 --> 05:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and you in a free market
 
05:46:57.110 --> 05:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
and it's a great option for a consumer
 
05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
good you can have different companies
 
05:47:00.590 --> 05:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
working to produce the best good at the
 
05:47:03.048 --> 05:47:03.058 align:start position:0%
lowest price and you can buy it and you
 
05:47:05.030 --> 05:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
can compare and shop and you also have
 
05:47:07.010 --> 05:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
the choice to not buy it if you think it
 
05:47:08.810 --> 05:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
is more money than you wish to spend for
 
05:47:11.270 --> 05:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
that good medicine doesn't work that way
 
05:47:13.610 --> 05:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
if you're sitting there in the Ew with a
 
05:47:15.890 --> 05:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
broken ankle or better yet inflamed
 
05:47:17.330 --> 05:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
appendix and you need it taken care of
 
05:47:18.708 --> 05:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be able to shop
 
05:47:20.448 --> 05:47:20.458 align:start position:0%
around other hospitals to find out who
 
05:47:22.490 --> 05:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
has a better deal and the it's probably
 
05:47:24.650 --> 05:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
not going to be wise to be able to say I
 
05:47:26.448 --> 05:47:26.458 align:start position:0%
think that costs too much I will not
 
05:47:28.548 --> 05:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
elect to have that surgery that's not
 
05:47:30.288 --> 05:47:30.298 align:start position:0%
going to lead to a good outcome
 
05:47:32.330 --> 05:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
so it simply doesn't function as a free
 
05:47:35.350 --> 05:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
market and so what happens here is again
 
05:47:38.448 --> 05:47:38.458 align:start position:0%
these places work you know nine to five
 
05:47:41.270 --> 05:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
hours or maybe seven to five hours they
 
05:47:43.310 --> 05:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh take the elective stuff that pays
 
05:47:45.650 --> 05:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
well and the problem is that you cannot
 
05:47:47.390 --> 05:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
as representative Gage has pointed out
 
05:47:49.788 --> 05:47:49.798 align:start position:0%
support a local hospital on the
 
05:47:51.770 --> 05:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
reimbursements that are left over they
 
05:47:53.510 --> 05:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
will not be there and they the reason
 
05:47:56.090 --> 05:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
they're called critical access is that
 
05:47:57.590 --> 05:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
they're there to provide the critical
 
05:48:00.650 --> 05:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
care for people in the community because
 
05:48:03.230 --> 05:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
when you do get run over by a truck you
 
05:48:04.910 --> 05:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily be transported 100
 
05:48:06.650 --> 05:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
miles to some other hospital because
 
05:48:08.930 --> 05:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
there's none around we need them in our
 
05:48:11.090 --> 05:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
rural areas and even our more urban
 
05:48:12.708 --> 05:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
areas for people who can't afford the
 
05:48:15.110 --> 05:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
other hospitals the key issue is
 
05:48:16.910 --> 05:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
no matter how you shake it if you pull
 
05:48:18.650 --> 05:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
out the money from them we're going to
 
05:48:20.570 --> 05:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
lose them and that will have an enormous
 
05:48:23.030 --> 05:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
impact on the accessibility of all of us
 
05:48:25.010 --> 05:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
to health care and and because it just
 
05:48:26.150 --> 05:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't function like a free market
 
05:48:28.490 --> 05:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
05:48:28.500 --> 05:48:32.030 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
Shapiro

05:48:32.030 --> 05:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:35.270 --> 05:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
05:48:37.190 --> 05:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
I think it's great that we have this
 
05:48:38.868 --> 05:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
extra time so we could have a
 
05:48:40.788 --> 05:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
philosophical debate about
 
05:48:40.798 --> 05:48:42.110 align:start position:0%
philosophical debate about
um

05:48:42.110 --> 05:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:45.288 --> 05:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
about open markets and um but we're
 
05:48:46.610 --> 05:48:46.620 align:start position:0%
probably not going to convince one
 
05:48:48.470 --> 05:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
another I mean there are those of us who
 
05:48:50.868 --> 05:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
feel like the problem with medicine is
 
05:48:53.150 --> 05:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
that it's based on free markets and
 
05:48:54.890 --> 05:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
there's prob and there's others of us
 
05:48:57.350 --> 05:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
who feel like the problem is that it's
 
05:49:00.770 --> 05:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:02.150 --> 05:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
um so we're probably not going to
 
05:49:03.650 --> 05:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
convince each other although I think
 
05:49:05.750 --> 05:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's a good thing to talk about
 
05:49:07.610 --> 05:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
um I also served on that committee with
 
05:49:10.850 --> 05:49:10.860 align:start position:0%
representative knurk and for me
 
05:49:10.860 --> 05:49:11.448 align:start position:0%
representative knurk and for me
um

05:49:11.448 --> 05:49:11.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:14.330 --> 05:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
when people came to speak from critical
 
05:49:17.150 --> 05:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
care hospitals in the North Country they
 
05:49:19.788 --> 05:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
spoke about the possibility of having to
 
05:49:20.770 --> 05:49:20.780 align:start position:0%
do without
 
05:49:23.390 --> 05:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
obstetrics in their communities but to
 
05:49:25.190 --> 05:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
me the most poignant thing was when
 
05:49:28.910 --> 05:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
people talked about a hospital
 
05:49:31.128 --> 05:49:31.138 align:start position:0%
the risk of a hospital closing and
 
05:49:32.930 --> 05:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
they're just not being an emergency room
 
05:49:35.868 --> 05:49:35.878 align:start position:0%
in a in a community and
 
05:49:35.878 --> 05:49:38.390 align:start position:0%
in a in a community and
um

05:49:38.390 --> 05:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:41.990 --> 05:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know we we are lucky to live in a
 
05:49:45.830 --> 05:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
country where we are used to and feel
 
05:49:48.048 --> 05:49:48.058 align:start position:0%
like we deserve to be able to go to an
 
05:49:50.930 --> 05:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
emergency room in case of a critical
 
05:49:53.868 --> 05:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
emergency and that just might not be the
 
05:49:53.878 --> 05:49:55.190 align:start position:0%
emergency and that just might not be the
case

05:49:55.190 --> 05:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
case
 
05:49:55.200 --> 05:49:56.208 align:start position:0%
case
um

05:49:56.208 --> 05:49:56.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:59.930 --> 05:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
if um Financial pressure causes some of
 
05:50:01.850 --> 05:50:01.860 align:start position:0%
these hospitals to close
 
05:50:05.090 --> 05:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
so I would support voting to itl this
 
05:50:07.368 --> 05:50:07.378 align:start position:0%
bill I'd like to move on to our three
 
05:50:10.670 --> 05:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
o'clock Hearing in a minute but uh the
 
05:50:12.770 --> 05:50:12.780 align:start position:0%

290
 
05:50:40.930 --> 05:50:40.940 align:start position:0%

Committee hearing
 
05:52:58.730 --> 05:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
on Bill 350.
 
05:53:01.070 --> 05:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
for many qualified patients and
 
05:53:03.288 --> 05:53:03.298 align:start position:0%

cannabis for therapeutic use
 
05:53:10.310 --> 05:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
and I will point out to those on this
 
05:53:13.070 --> 05:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
bill it is an important bill we respect
 
05:53:16.368 --> 05:53:16.378 align:start position:0%
uh what you are bringing forward to us
 
05:53:19.190 --> 05:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
as we do with all bills but because of
 
05:53:21.890 --> 05:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
intending weather numbers of us will be
 
05:53:21.900 --> 05:53:23.690 align:start position:0%
intending weather numbers of us will be
leaving

05:53:23.690 --> 05:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
leaving
 
05:53:25.788 --> 05:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to hear from
 
05:53:28.910 --> 05:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
three to four group speakers on this
 
05:53:31.548 --> 05:53:31.558 align:start position:0%
bill and then we will
 
05:53:33.350 --> 05:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
05:53:36.048 --> 05:53:36.058 align:start position:0%
movement to a continuance on another
 
05:53:36.058 --> 05:53:37.850 align:start position:0%
movement to a continuance on another
date

05:53:37.850 --> 05:53:37.860 align:start position:0%
date
 
05:53:40.070 --> 05:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative Acton would you introduce
 
05:53:41.690 --> 05:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
your girl please
 
05:53:43.970 --> 05:53:43.980 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chair and uh thank you
 
05:53:45.708 --> 05:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
all for your time uh what we have here
 
05:53:49.010 --> 05:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
is HB 350 permitting qualified patients
 
05:53:51.410 --> 05:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
and designated caregivers to cultivate
 
05:53:53.990 --> 05:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis for therapeutic use now this
 
05:53:55.610 --> 05:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
bill has passed the house several times
 
05:53:55.620 --> 05:53:57.350 align:start position:0%
bill has passed the house several times
so

05:53:57.350 --> 05:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:53:57.360 --> 05:53:58.430 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:53:58.430 --> 05:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:00.410 --> 05:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
I originally considered to be honest
 
05:54:02.150 --> 05:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
with you um rather than going through
 
05:54:04.368 --> 05:54:04.378 align:start position:0%
the same thing again and again
 
05:54:06.890 --> 05:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
um of of re of retaining this bill and
 
05:54:10.250 --> 05:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
dealing with the next next session but I
 
05:54:12.530 --> 05:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
think that does a disservice to patients
 
05:54:14.270 --> 05:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
who are suffering right now and let me
 
05:54:15.850 --> 05:54:15.860 align:start position:0%
explain uh why I think that way
 
05:54:17.628 --> 05:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
basically what we're doing is we're
 
05:54:19.548 --> 05:54:19.558 align:start position:0%
allowing patients as designated
 
05:54:22.910 --> 05:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
caregivers to grow their own cannabis at
 
05:54:26.090 --> 05:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
home and it allows for Three Mature
 
05:54:29.030 --> 05:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
plants three immature plants and 12
 
05:54:32.030 --> 05:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
seedlings to be cultivated in a secure
 
05:54:36.230 --> 05:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
location out of of sight of neighbors
 
05:54:37.788 --> 05:54:37.798 align:start position:0%
um in a
 
05:54:40.788 --> 05:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
within the uh either the caregivers home
 
05:54:42.650 --> 05:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
or the patient's home so they you can't
 
05:54:45.048 --> 05:54:45.058 align:start position:0%
set up a a commercial grow room or
 
05:54:46.788 --> 05:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
anything like that so
 
05:54:47.990 --> 05:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
um you know a lot of work has gone into
 
05:54:49.910 --> 05:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
this over the years we we put a lot of
 
05:54:53.030 --> 05:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
work into it in 2019 I've did a lot of
 
05:54:55.670 --> 05:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
changes and so forth but um it just it
 
05:54:57.890 --> 05:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
just unable we're not unable to get it
 
05:55:00.110 --> 05:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
through maybe this time will be the um
 
05:55:02.990 --> 05:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
the time it works uh let's just um you
 
05:55:04.490 --> 05:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
know a lot of people who are who are
 
05:55:05.570 --> 05:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
against this
 
05:55:07.910 --> 05:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
um can't seem to
 
05:55:10.548 --> 05:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
comprehend how we can allow people to
 
05:55:12.590 --> 05:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
grow Canada how do you not control that
 
05:55:14.390 --> 05:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
well let's take a look at the states
 
05:55:17.868 --> 05:55:17.878 align:start position:0%
around us in Maine any adult not just
 
05:55:20.750 --> 05:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
medical can grow up to six adult plants
 
05:55:23.270 --> 05:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
in their own home any anyone it's a it's
 
05:55:26.150 --> 05:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
recreational grow uh the same with
 
05:55:28.310 --> 05:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh Massachusetts you're
 
05:55:30.770 --> 05:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
allowed to grow six plants and two
 
05:55:32.990 --> 05:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
people in a home can uh you can grow 12
 
05:55:36.110 --> 05:55:36.120 align:start position:0%
plants you're also allowed to give an
 
05:55:38.690 --> 05:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
ounce of of uh cannabis to each to other
 
05:55:41.090 --> 05:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
people in Vermont you're allowed to grow
 
05:55:42.830 --> 05:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
nine plants and this is all once again
 
05:55:45.708 --> 05:55:45.718 align:start position:0%
not just medical it's it's anyone Rhode
 
05:55:47.750 --> 05:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
Island six plants
 
05:55:50.770 --> 05:55:50.780 align:start position:0%
um so this is already happening for
 
05:55:54.170 --> 05:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
anyone in the rest of New England uh
 
05:55:56.330 --> 05:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
Connecticut uh doesn't have this but but
 
05:55:58.368 --> 05:55:58.378 align:start position:0%
as far as all the states surrounding us
 
05:55:59.868 --> 05:55:59.878 align:start position:0%
and even in Canada
 
05:55:59.878 --> 05:56:00.890 align:start position:0%
and even in Canada
um

05:56:00.890 --> 05:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:03.170 --> 05:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
adults are allowed to do this and we've
 
05:56:04.788 --> 05:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
yet to even allow our patients to do it
 
05:56:06.708 --> 05:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
now why patients need to do it is is
 
05:56:08.930 --> 05:56:08.940 align:start position:0%
first of all affordability it is
 
05:56:10.548 --> 05:56:10.558 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive we created this
 
05:56:13.850 --> 05:56:13.860 align:start position:0%
program with a lot of overhead a lot of
 
05:56:16.490 --> 05:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
regulations and the end result is high
 
05:56:20.628 --> 05:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
product uh high prices for for patients
 
05:56:22.730 --> 05:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
and um you patient you know these are
 
05:56:24.948 --> 05:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
these are desperately ill people and
 
05:56:27.650 --> 05:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
they really it's it's difficult to
 
05:56:30.530 --> 05:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
afford going to the uh alternative
 
05:56:31.850 --> 05:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
treatment centers
 
05:56:35.570 --> 05:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
um secondly is variety there's uh you
 
05:56:37.010 --> 05:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
know we've learned over the years that
 
05:56:39.110 --> 05:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
certain strains have different effects
 
05:56:42.650 --> 05:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
for various illnesses and effects on for
 
05:56:45.288 --> 05:56:45.298 align:start position:0%
different people and so forth uh the the
 
05:56:47.448 --> 05:56:47.458 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers can't
 
05:56:50.390 --> 05:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
provide that they can't have that it'd
 
05:56:52.368 --> 05:56:52.378 align:start position:0%
be a possible for them to have the the
 
05:56:55.910 --> 05:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
variety of strains and that are needed
 
05:56:58.970 --> 05:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
for to treat individual ailments so this
 
05:57:00.890 --> 05:57:00.900 align:start position:0%
would allow patients or designated
 
05:57:02.750 --> 05:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
caregivers to
 
05:57:05.150 --> 05:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
um grow the specific Strays for the for
 
05:57:06.948 --> 05:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
the specific patients
 
05:57:08.570 --> 05:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
so really that's that's what we're
 
05:57:11.770 --> 05:57:11.780 align:start position:0%
trying to do here um we hear a lot of
 
05:57:13.610 --> 05:57:13.620 align:start position:0%
fear-mongering sometimes about how
 
05:57:14.868 --> 05:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
people uh you know what are they gonna
 
05:57:15.948 --> 05:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
they're gonna give it to their friends
 
05:57:18.288 --> 05:57:18.298 align:start position:0%
are they gonna is it you know kids and
 
05:57:19.430 --> 05:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
so forth but
 
05:57:22.250 --> 05:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
we're far behind other states and and I
 
05:57:23.690 --> 05:57:23.700 align:start position:0%
just don't I don't understand anymore
 
05:57:26.150 --> 05:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
why uh we can't just allow patients to
 
05:57:27.770 --> 05:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
do that so
 
05:57:28.910 --> 05:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to go ahead and and
 
05:57:31.850 --> 05:57:31.860 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony and there's
 
05:57:33.948 --> 05:57:33.958 align:start position:0%
certainly if anyone has any questions
 
05:57:35.570 --> 05:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
um myself or one of the speakers coming
 
05:57:38.410 --> 05:57:38.420 align:start position:0%
after me can answer that thank you
 
05:57:41.270 --> 05:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative action
 
05:57:41.280 --> 05:57:43.310 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative action
yes

05:57:43.310 --> 05:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:57:47.990 --> 05:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
um representative Folsom thank you chair
 
05:57:50.690 --> 05:57:50.700 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking this question
 
05:57:53.390 --> 05:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
um this I I've been reading all the
 
05:57:55.310 --> 05:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
emails that have been coming in about
 
05:57:57.410 --> 05:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
this and so
 
05:58:00.048 --> 05:58:00.058 align:start position:0%
um it's left me with some questions on
 
05:58:02.628 --> 05:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
on kind of ambivalence on this whole
 
05:58:04.548 --> 05:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
thing but
 
05:58:06.770 --> 05:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I wanted to know is
 
05:58:10.850 --> 05:58:10.860 align:start position:0%
what is approximately the current prices
 
05:58:15.470 --> 05:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
for an ounce of marijuana uh purchased
 
05:58:17.270 --> 05:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
at a
 
05:58:19.788 --> 05:58:19.798 align:start position:0%
um dispensary
 
05:58:22.190 --> 05:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
of the going price in New Hampshire is
 
05:58:27.770 --> 05:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
uh between 350 and 400 dollars
 
05:58:29.750 --> 05:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
and that's very expensive you know
 
05:58:31.610 --> 05:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money some people need
 
05:58:34.010 --> 05:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
several ounces a month for their
 
05:58:35.570 --> 05:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
treatment so that's
 
05:58:38.170 --> 05:58:38.180 align:start position:0%
um and that price could be cut
 
05:58:40.910 --> 05:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
tremendously by growing your own okay
 
05:58:43.910 --> 05:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
then my next question is
 
05:58:43.920 --> 05:58:44.810 align:start position:0%
then my next question is
um

05:58:44.810 --> 05:58:44.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:47.930 --> 05:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
not with not incriminating yourself but
 
05:58:50.448 --> 05:58:50.458 align:start position:0%
uh what is the going rate for Black
 
05:58:50.458 --> 05:58:52.070 align:start position:0%
uh what is the going rate for Black
Market

05:58:52.070 --> 05:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
Market
 
05:58:52.080 --> 05:58:56.510 align:start position:0%
Market
marijuana

05:58:56.510 --> 05:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:00.170 --> 05:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
the going rate you know it it's it
 
05:59:01.750 --> 05:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
depends it's usually
 
05:59:05.750 --> 05:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
150 to 200 uh probably pushing 200 for
 
05:59:08.330 --> 05:59:08.340 align:start position:0%
the medical quality that has been grown
 
05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
in a controlled facility and so forth
 
05:59:12.048 --> 05:59:12.058 align:start position:0%
and that that is part of the problems
 
05:59:13.548 --> 05:59:13.558 align:start position:0%
you just on the black market you don't
 
05:59:16.390 --> 05:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
know what you're getting and um
 
05:59:19.010 --> 05:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
and in this case growing your own you
 
05:59:21.708 --> 05:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
can control the the process and and uh
 
05:59:23.868 --> 05:59:23.878 align:start position:0%
know that know that you're producing
 
05:59:26.628 --> 05:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
quality product for yourself and how
 
05:59:30.770 --> 05:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
much and how much uh would uh an ounce
 
05:59:33.128 --> 05:59:33.138 align:start position:0%
thrown at home
 
05:59:35.390 --> 05:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
eventually cost the person thinking
 
05:59:38.270 --> 05:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
about lighting in heat and
 
05:59:40.850 --> 05:59:40.860 align:start position:0%
sure uh it's usually you know
 
05:59:43.610 --> 05:59:43.620 align:start position:0%
for three plants you'd you'd use a
 
05:59:47.208 --> 05:59:47.218 align:start position:0%
probably a high uh you know high power
 
05:59:49.250 --> 05:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
lighting maybe a thousand watt light it
 
05:59:51.048 --> 05:59:51.058 align:start position:0%
costs between fifty and sixty dollars a
 
05:59:53.868 --> 05:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
month to run that so it's really it's
 
05:59:56.390 --> 05:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
Pennies on the dollar less
 
05:59:56.400 --> 05:59:57.288 align:start position:0%
Pennies on the dollar less
um

05:59:57.288 --> 05:59:57.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:58.910 --> 05:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's just overhead costs it's it's
 
06:00:01.190 --> 06:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
utilities and and you know time doesn't
 
06:00:03.110 --> 06:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
matter but the but it's it's basically
 
06:00:05.930 --> 06:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
the the utilities and the fertilizer and
 
06:00:07.670 --> 06:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
the the hardware and so forth which you
 
06:00:10.610 --> 06:00:10.620 align:start position:0%
buy once and you can use repeatedly
 
06:00:14.208 --> 06:00:14.218 align:start position:0%
so that one more so that would
 
06:00:18.350 --> 06:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:18.360 --> 06:00:19.670 align:start position:0%
 
probably

06:00:19.670 --> 06:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
probably
 
06:00:21.470 --> 06:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
um 25 an ounce
 
06:00:23.448 --> 06:00:23.458 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:00:25.368 --> 06:00:25.378 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
06:00:25.378 --> 06:00:27.650 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative

Acton
 
06:00:31.310 --> 06:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman yes representative
 
06:00:31.320 --> 06:00:32.448 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman yes representative
Nelson

06:00:32.448 --> 06:00:32.458 align:start position:0%
Nelson
 
06:00:35.410 --> 06:00:35.420 align:start position:0%
one is how many plans can a designator
 
06:00:38.750 --> 06:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
caregiver grow for people can they grow
 
06:00:41.270 --> 06:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
for 10 people or just one or two
 
06:00:43.788 --> 06:00:43.798 align:start position:0%
no that's been limited uh so a
 
06:00:45.708 --> 06:00:45.718 align:start position:0%
designated caregiver can only grow for
 
06:00:47.990 --> 06:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
one person yeah we didn't want to create
 
06:00:51.110 --> 06:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know pot shops or or commercial
 
06:00:53.150 --> 06:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
Grows Where one person can bring off and
 
06:00:54.948 --> 06:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
then you know they had that issue up in
 
06:00:57.650 --> 06:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
Maine where you could have one paragraph
 
06:00:59.750 --> 06:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
could grow for six people and and you
 
06:01:01.128 --> 06:01:01.138 align:start position:0%
know so we wanted to avoid that so it's
 
06:01:03.948 --> 06:01:03.958 align:start position:0%
really a caregiver is um allowed to grow
 
06:01:05.570 --> 06:01:05.580 align:start position:0%
for only one person
 
06:01:08.230 --> 06:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
and now a um
 
06:01:11.810 --> 06:01:11.820 align:start position:0%
a patient can grow for themselves and
 
06:01:14.390 --> 06:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
also grow as a caregiver for somebody
 
06:01:17.030 --> 06:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
else so that would be the maximum of six
 
06:01:19.548 --> 06:01:19.558 align:start position:0%
plants for one location in in that
 
06:01:22.310 --> 06:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:26.270 --> 06:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up question sure yeah are all
 
06:01:28.128 --> 06:01:28.138 align:start position:0%
these people registered who is going to
 
06:01:30.650 --> 06:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
receive it or who could grow it for them
 
06:01:32.930 --> 06:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
yes see well um
 
06:01:35.208 --> 06:01:35.218 align:start position:0%
everyone has to be a part of the program
 
06:01:37.430 --> 06:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
so you have to be licensed um either as
 
06:01:40.850 --> 06:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
a patient or as a caregiver and uh
 
06:01:43.670 --> 06:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
there's strict rules we create a special
 
06:01:47.990 --> 06:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
felony for diverting cannabis out of the
 
06:01:50.390 --> 06:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
program and say if somebody was caught
 
06:01:54.650 --> 06:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
selling it to just whoever uh they would
 
06:01:57.288 --> 06:01:57.298 align:start position:0%
actually be guilty of of
 
06:02:00.110 --> 06:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
the special felony that we created for
 
06:02:01.788 --> 06:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
this program as well as any other
 
06:02:03.948 --> 06:02:03.958 align:start position:0%
generic felonies that already that are
 
06:02:05.270 --> 06:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
already in a book so you're in big
 
06:02:07.868 --> 06:02:07.878 align:start position:0%
trouble if you get caught diverting
 
06:02:09.890 --> 06:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis out of this program
 
06:02:11.570 --> 06:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
to somebody else I I don't believe
 
06:02:13.490 --> 06:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
they've even arrested anybody on that
 
06:02:13.500 --> 06:02:14.208 align:start position:0%
they've even arrested anybody on that
yet

06:02:14.208 --> 06:02:14.218 align:start position:0%
yet
 
06:02:16.070 --> 06:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:02:18.470 --> 06:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative Gary thank you Mr
 
06:02:18.480 --> 06:02:19.730 align:start position:0%
representative Gary thank you Mr
chairman

06:02:19.730 --> 06:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:02:22.190 --> 06:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
um not that I disagree with it but I
 
06:02:24.288 --> 06:02:24.298 align:start position:0%
thought you just said that you could
 
06:02:27.410 --> 06:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
grow it for one a caregiver could grow
 
06:02:31.430 --> 06:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
up for one person but on page one uh
 
06:02:33.770 --> 06:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
lines 11 and 12.
 
06:02:38.090 --> 06:02:38.100 align:start position:0%
as well from 215 it says a caregiver can
 
06:02:40.670 --> 06:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
assist with one or more not to exceed
 
06:02:44.150 --> 06:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
five qualifying patients and if they
 
06:02:47.090 --> 06:02:47.100 align:start position:0%
live greater than 50 miles away they can
 
06:02:51.170 --> 06:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
assist throw it up for real cannabis for
 
06:02:54.410 --> 06:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
up to 9 12 5 patients I'm not
 
06:02:56.208 --> 06:02:56.218 align:start position:0%
disagreeing with that I just wanted to
 
06:02:59.448 --> 06:02:59.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:01.368 --> 06:03:01.378 align:start position:0%
yeah you know it's been two years since
 
06:03:03.470 --> 06:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
we went through this line by line so I
 
06:03:05.770 --> 06:03:05.780 align:start position:0%
may have to get clarification like if
 
06:03:08.030 --> 06:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
Michael if Michael Holt is here that
 
06:03:10.610 --> 06:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
would be uh but yeah they um
 
06:03:12.170 --> 06:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
I may have gotten that one wrong there
 
06:03:14.868 --> 06:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll have to um clarify that for
 
06:03:14.878 --> 06:03:19.310 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll have to um clarify that for
you

06:03:19.310 --> 06:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:25.190 --> 06:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative yeah thank you so uh I I
 
06:03:26.868 --> 06:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
keep wanting to make a statement and I
 
06:03:28.310 --> 06:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
haven't figured out how to make it into
 
06:03:30.048 --> 06:03:30.058 align:start position:0%
a question actually you representative
 
06:03:32.150 --> 06:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
gay can I just have a follow-up on the
 
06:03:34.788 --> 06:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
last question a a caregiver can assist
 
06:03:38.990 --> 06:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
patients by say going in and obtaining
 
06:03:40.970 --> 06:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
cannabis at the alternative treatment
 
06:03:43.190 --> 06:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
center for them but you can only grow
 
06:03:45.830 --> 06:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
for one person so you can help patients
 
06:03:49.548 --> 06:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
in the traditional uh role of of being a
 
06:03:52.250 --> 06:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
caregiver which which is you usually
 
06:03:53.868 --> 06:03:53.878 align:start position:0%
just if someone's too sick to leave the
 
06:03:56.090 --> 06:03:56.100 align:start position:0%
house you have a caregiver go to the ATC
 
06:03:58.128 --> 06:03:58.138 align:start position:0%
and get that for them being being the
 
06:03:59.690 --> 06:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
caregiver they're protected from arrest
 
06:04:01.010 --> 06:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
if they get pulled over something but
 
06:04:02.868 --> 06:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
you can only grow for one person so you
 
06:04:05.090 --> 06:04:05.100 align:start position:0%
can't grow for five people and have a
 
06:04:12.170 --> 06:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:14.330 --> 06:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
06:04:14.340 --> 06:04:15.890 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
Acton

06:04:15.890 --> 06:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
Acton
 
06:04:19.208 --> 06:04:19.218 align:start position:0%
Mr care representative can Eric
 
06:04:22.670 --> 06:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
yes please just a quick one um we spent
 
06:04:24.110 --> 06:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of time talking about financial
 
06:04:27.948 --> 06:04:27.958 align:start position:0%
barriers uh is that true also that they
 
06:04:30.830 --> 06:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
are geographical access barriers for
 
06:04:32.448 --> 06:04:32.458 align:start position:0%
patients in the therapeutic cannabis
 
06:04:34.548 --> 06:04:34.558 align:start position:0%
program and could you discuss those
 
06:04:37.670 --> 06:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
yes uh well that's a better problem from
 
06:04:40.310 --> 06:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
the get-go is is the location of the
 
06:04:44.208 --> 06:04:44.218 align:start position:0%
atcs in the the uh small amount of
 
06:04:47.090 --> 06:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
licenses uh like for instance for for me
 
06:04:48.350 --> 06:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
to go to the
 
06:04:50.030 --> 06:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers it's it's
 
06:04:52.010 --> 06:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
in Dover it's about a 45 minute drive
 
06:04:54.230 --> 06:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
but it gets much worse as you go north
 
06:04:57.410 --> 06:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
and uh so be able to grow at home as
 
06:04:59.090 --> 06:04:59.100 align:start position:0%
always you guys get to run to the deal
 
06:05:02.510 --> 06:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
up there but um what we you know what
 
06:05:05.690 --> 06:05:05.700 align:start position:0%
we've allowed we've made some some uh
 
06:05:08.150 --> 06:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the law itself there there's uh you
 
06:05:08.160 --> 06:05:09.170 align:start position:0%
in the law itself there there's uh you
know

06:05:09.170 --> 06:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:05:09.180 --> 06:05:10.430 align:start position:0%
know
some

06:05:10.430 --> 06:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
some
 
06:05:12.410 --> 06:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
some things have been changed for that
 
06:05:16.070 --> 06:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
but in general it's hours of driving if
 
06:05:18.948 --> 06:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
you're in the North Country to get to a
 
06:05:21.288 --> 06:05:21.298 align:start position:0%
treatment center so growing
 
06:05:23.570 --> 06:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
at home and and thank you for reminding
 
06:05:25.788 --> 06:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
uh me about that representative because
 
06:05:28.548 --> 06:05:28.558 align:start position:0%
that is an issue uh that us Flatlanders
 
06:05:30.770 --> 06:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
down here uh forget is that it it takes
 
06:05:32.868 --> 06:05:32.878 align:start position:0%
you got to drive two hours to do
 
06:05:34.850 --> 06:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
anything other than you know so it's
 
06:05:38.390 --> 06:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
unfair to the patients up north
 
06:05:40.868 --> 06:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:05:45.368 --> 06:05:45.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:48.948 --> 06:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
yes representative Olson
 
06:05:54.048 --> 06:05:54.058 align:start position:0%
um and for uh thank you Mr chair um
 
06:05:58.490 --> 06:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
representative Acton um are there any
 
06:06:04.910 --> 06:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines with regards to training or
 
06:06:04.920 --> 06:06:05.930 align:start position:0%
guidelines with regards to training or
um

06:06:05.930 --> 06:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:09.948 --> 06:06:09.958 align:start position:0%
classes of some kind for individuals who
 
06:06:13.128 --> 06:06:13.138 align:start position:0%
are going to grow the Cannabis on their
 
06:06:17.150 --> 06:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
own and then turn it into whatever form
 
06:06:19.990 --> 06:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
of product they want so they understand
 
06:06:22.610 --> 06:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
potency for
 
06:06:24.650 --> 06:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
gummy bear
 
06:06:27.890 --> 06:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
yeah this there's there's not much
 
06:06:30.230 --> 06:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
formal training
 
06:06:32.208 --> 06:06:32.218 align:start position:0%
um certainly not New Hampshire because
 
06:06:34.810 --> 06:06:34.820 align:start position:0%
it's it's really not
 
06:06:37.310 --> 06:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
there's just no Market
 
06:06:37.320 --> 06:06:37.970 align:start position:0%
there's just no Market
um

06:06:37.970 --> 06:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:37.980 --> 06:06:39.230 align:start position:0%
um
all

06:06:39.230 --> 06:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
all
 
06:06:41.330 --> 06:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
information you'd ever want to know is
 
06:06:44.110 --> 06:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
all on YouTube so so you could there's
 
06:06:47.990 --> 06:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
thousands of hours of of training videos
 
06:06:50.510 --> 06:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
online that people can watch and that's
 
06:06:52.128 --> 06:06:52.138 align:start position:0%
how I got a lot of my information just
 
06:06:54.170 --> 06:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
watching uh because you know this has
 
06:06:56.150 --> 06:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
been going on for for 10 over 10 years
 
06:06:58.310 --> 06:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
now around the country so the the body
 
06:07:00.650 --> 06:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
of knowledge is quite amazing so the
 
06:07:02.030 --> 06:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
information is there it's just all
 
06:07:04.070 --> 06:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
online rather than
 
06:07:07.010 --> 06:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
going and actually training at a
 
06:07:08.270 --> 06:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
facility or something like that that
 
06:07:10.548 --> 06:07:10.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't quite exist certainly not here
 
06:07:12.708 --> 06:07:12.718 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I'm not sure where
 
06:07:14.390 --> 06:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
else but the information is out there
 
06:07:17.868 --> 06:07:17.878 align:start position:0%
and very specific recipes and and so
 
06:07:28.010 --> 06:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:28.020 --> 06:07:29.690 align:start position:0%
 
bill

06:07:29.690 --> 06:07:29.700 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:07:31.970 --> 06:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
um the chair would now like to take out
 
06:07:34.430 --> 06:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
of order uh Chief I have one more
 
06:07:34.440 --> 06:07:35.750 align:start position:0%
of order uh Chief I have one more
question

06:07:35.750 --> 06:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:07:35.760 --> 06:07:40.910 align:start position:0%
question
sure

06:07:40.910 --> 06:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:42.490 --> 06:07:42.500 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:07:45.350 --> 06:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative act and thank you for
 
06:07:47.208 --> 06:07:47.218 align:start position:0%
um introducing this
 
06:07:48.890 --> 06:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
um we've talked about
 
06:07:53.030 --> 06:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
um relative pros and cons of
 
06:07:56.930 --> 06:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
um you know not wanting to promote use
 
06:07:59.510 --> 06:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
for adolescence
 
06:07:59.520 --> 06:08:01.610 align:start position:0%
for adolescence
um

06:08:01.610 --> 06:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:04.250 --> 06:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
you know ways that that
 
06:08:04.260 --> 06:08:06.170 align:start position:0%
you know ways that that
um

06:08:06.170 --> 06:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:08.868 --> 06:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
that cannabis grown at home might fall
 
06:08:11.150 --> 06:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
into the wrong hands
 
06:08:13.490 --> 06:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
um on the other side there's the
 
06:08:15.830 --> 06:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
geographical issues and there's the cost
 
06:08:18.410 --> 06:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
issues but I'm wondering if you could
 
06:08:21.830 --> 06:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
conceive that people who are actually
 
06:08:25.310 --> 06:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
able to grow their own cannabis that
 
06:08:27.470 --> 06:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
there might be some value added just in
 
06:08:29.990 --> 06:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
being able to grow their own
 
06:08:30.000 --> 06:08:31.910 align:start position:0%
being able to grow their own
um

06:08:31.910 --> 06:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:36.350 --> 06:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of self-reliance in terms of
 
06:08:38.868 --> 06:08:38.878 align:start position:0%
um putting their hands in the soil in
 
06:08:42.410 --> 06:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:45.170 --> 06:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
you know just this is to Live Free or
 
06:08:47.390 --> 06:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
Die State and and might there not be
 
06:08:49.970 --> 06:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
some value gained in people being able
 
06:08:52.190 --> 06:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
to take care of themselves
 
06:08:55.190 --> 06:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
yes um well that that's part of it as
 
06:08:58.390 --> 06:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
well and patients I think want to be
 
06:09:01.788 --> 06:09:01.798 align:start position:0%
there's a therapeutic aspect to Growing
 
06:09:04.490 --> 06:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
to we all understand who are gardeners
 
06:09:06.890 --> 06:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
there's a therapeutic aspect of that and
 
06:09:09.288 --> 06:09:09.298 align:start position:0%
and so to be able to produce exactly
 
06:09:11.570 --> 06:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
what the strain that you want
 
06:09:14.270 --> 06:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
um and and controlling you in in your
 
06:09:16.128 --> 06:09:16.138 align:start position:0%
own home I think there's there's value
 
06:09:17.628 --> 06:09:17.638 align:start position:0%
to that
 
06:09:20.330 --> 06:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
um I you know I don't I haven't grown
 
06:09:23.150 --> 06:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
but I I I'm an avid Gardener and I
 
06:09:23.160 --> 06:09:25.070 align:start position:0%
but I I I'm an avid Gardener and I
there's

06:09:25.070 --> 06:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
there's
 
06:09:26.990 --> 06:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
there's an intrinsic value to that that
 
06:09:27.000 --> 06:09:28.310 align:start position:0%
there's an intrinsic value to that that
really

06:09:28.310 --> 06:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
really
 
06:09:33.010 --> 06:09:33.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:36.770 --> 06:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
because it was snowing I guess you're in
 
06:09:38.270 --> 06:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
the you can't talk on the phone I'll

06:10:43.440 --> 06:10:45.610 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

space bar down apparently okay
 
06:10:58.620 --> 06:11:00.110 align:start position:0%
space bar down apparently okay
okay

06:11:00.110 --> 06:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:11:02.990 --> 06:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh ready to go all right so I'm
 
06:11:04.250 --> 06:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
here representing the New Hampshire
 
06:11:05.750 --> 06:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
Chiefs I'm sorry for the technical
 
06:11:05.760 --> 06:11:07.250 align:start position:0%
Chiefs I'm sorry for the technical
issues

06:11:07.250 --> 06:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
issues
 
06:11:09.048 --> 06:11:09.058 align:start position:0%
um the chiefs of police here in New
 
06:11:11.628 --> 06:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are opposed to this bill for
 
06:11:13.490 --> 06:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
the following reasons as we all know
 
06:11:16.310 --> 06:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis is already widely available to
 
06:11:18.530 --> 06:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
qualifying patients and they're
 
06:11:20.510 --> 06:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
well-regulated therapeutic cannabis
 
06:11:23.208 --> 06:11:23.218 align:start position:0%
program but again as a reminder cannabis
 
06:11:26.090 --> 06:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
is not commercialized uh in New
 
06:11:28.310 --> 06:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like it is in our neighboring
 
06:11:31.010 --> 06:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
states of Maine and Vermont so that that
 
06:11:34.070 --> 06:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
is an unfair uh comparison because it is
 
06:11:36.650 --> 06:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
not commercialized here this bill we're
 
06:11:38.830 --> 06:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
concerned primarily because this bill
 
06:11:43.250 --> 06:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
removes the necessary regulatory uh and
 
06:11:45.590 --> 06:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
Regulation and controls over the
 
06:11:48.590 --> 06:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
distribution growing and distribution of
 
06:11:51.650 --> 06:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
cannabis for medical purposes there are
 
06:11:53.810 --> 06:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
ample studies that provide scientific
 
06:11:57.110 --> 06:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
proof that high potency cannabis leads
 
06:11:59.150 --> 06:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
to a host of medical and behavioral
 
06:12:01.368 --> 06:12:01.378 align:start position:0%
problems in a adults as well as children
 
06:12:04.010 --> 06:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
if this bill is passed members of the
 
06:12:06.170 --> 06:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
committee there is no regulation of the
 
06:12:09.350 --> 06:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
quality and potency of cannabis that
 
06:12:11.628 --> 06:12:11.638 align:start position:0%
will be used for medical purposes no
 
06:12:15.048 --> 06:12:15.058 align:start position:0%
medicine in any developed country used
 
06:12:17.448 --> 06:12:17.458 align:start position:0%
by medical practitioners is homegrown
 
06:12:20.270 --> 06:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
and dispensed as medicine without any
 
06:12:22.430 --> 06:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
degree of Regulation to ensure its
 
06:12:25.628 --> 06:12:25.638 align:start position:0%
quality Effectiveness and most of all
 
06:12:29.288 --> 06:12:29.298 align:start position:0%
safety so uh
 
06:12:33.048 --> 06:12:33.058 align:start position:0%
if homegrown cannabis is approved there
 
06:12:35.510 --> 06:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
will be absolutely no effective means
 
06:12:38.930 --> 06:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement to control homegrown
 
06:12:41.750 --> 06:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis there are absolutely no
 
06:12:45.048 --> 06:12:45.058 align:start position:0%
Provisions in this bill to ensure that
 
06:12:47.030 --> 06:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
the requirements for the number and
 
06:12:49.610 --> 06:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
limitation of the amount and number of
 
06:12:52.910 --> 06:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
plants grown and produced is maintained
 
06:12:56.810 --> 06:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
that's our principal concern now if the
 
06:13:00.708 --> 06:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
bill had ample regulatory applications
 
06:13:03.410 --> 06:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
that would allow for regulatory
 
06:13:05.750 --> 06:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
inspections of locations that are
 
06:13:08.330 --> 06:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
registered for home grow and home
 
06:13:10.850 --> 06:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
cultivation then the chiefs of Police
 
06:13:13.730 --> 06:13:13.740 align:start position:0%
Association would take another look at
 
06:13:14.628 --> 06:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
06:13:17.448 --> 06:13:17.458 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and any other regulatory
 
06:13:19.970 --> 06:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
agency is powerless as the bill is
 
06:13:22.610 --> 06:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
currently constructed to conduct any
 
06:13:25.128 --> 06:13:25.138 align:start position:0%
kind of periodic regulatory inspections
 
06:13:27.708 --> 06:13:27.718 align:start position:0%
and in fact in the previous testimony as
 
06:13:30.708 --> 06:13:30.718 align:start position:0%
it was introduced there have been uh no
 
06:13:35.270 --> 06:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
cases of the diversion of cannabis from
 
06:13:35.280 --> 06:13:36.730 align:start position:0%
cases of the diversion of cannabis from
the

06:13:36.730 --> 06:13:36.740 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:13:39.110 --> 06:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
authorized growing sites and the reason
 
06:13:40.850 --> 06:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
for that is is because of the State
 
06:13:43.910 --> 06:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
Challenge that law enforcement faces in
 
06:13:47.030 --> 06:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
being able to control cultivation of
 
06:13:49.970 --> 06:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
marijuana without any regulatory control
 
06:13:52.730 --> 06:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
there's been ample cases in other states
 
06:13:55.570 --> 06:13:55.580 align:start position:0%
where commercial Growers have exploited
 
06:13:58.250 --> 06:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
homegrown cultivation so this bill
 
06:14:00.350 --> 06:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
basically takes the breaks off cannabis
 
06:14:03.230 --> 06:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
and unleashes commercialization With No
 
06:14:06.288 --> 06:14:06.298 align:start position:0%
Boundaries controls or mechanisms under
 
06:14:08.750 --> 06:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
um under the veil of Compassionate Care
 
06:14:11.990 --> 06:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
so we're opposed to this particular bill
 
06:14:14.330 --> 06:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
for these reasons basically because of
 
06:14:18.110 --> 06:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
the ability for any regulatory agency or
 
06:14:21.170 --> 06:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency to be able to to
 
06:14:24.708 --> 06:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
control it so thank you for your time
 
06:14:26.750 --> 06:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for listening well you
 
06:14:33.170 --> 06:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:33.180 --> 06:14:37.010 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:14:37.010 --> 06:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:39.048 --> 06:14:39.058 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes state
 
06:14:41.030 --> 06:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative running coaching a
 
06:14:57.170 --> 06:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:59.868 --> 06:14:59.878 align:start position:0%
is representative Cushing does not
 
06:15:02.150 --> 06:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
appear to be available
 
06:15:06.948 --> 06:15:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:16.190 --> 06:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:17.390 --> 06:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
hi there
 
06:15:17.400 --> 06:15:20.030 align:start position:0%
hi there
hi

06:15:20.030 --> 06:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:22.490 --> 06:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
um so is now when I read my testimony
 
06:15:25.430 --> 06:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
now is the time perfect thank you so
 
06:15:27.230 --> 06:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
much clearly my first time doing this
 
06:15:29.230 --> 06:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
but something I'm very passionate about
 
06:15:32.570 --> 06:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
so my name is Kate Steinberg I am a
 
06:15:34.250 --> 06:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
resident of Ashland and Grafton County
 
06:15:36.530 --> 06:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today asking for your
 
06:15:40.030 --> 06:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
consideration in supporting HB 350.
 
06:15:42.650 --> 06:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
I I have been working in the Cannabis
 
06:15:44.750 --> 06:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
space for about five years
 
06:15:46.368 --> 06:15:46.378 align:start position:0%
um specifically working for a medical
 
06:15:48.770 --> 06:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
cannabis company and I have seen and
 
06:15:51.708 --> 06:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
heard both sides to this debate
 
06:15:53.448 --> 06:15:53.458 align:start position:0%
um but I am here today to speak on
 
06:15:55.010 --> 06:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
behalf of the patients
 
06:15:57.650 --> 06:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
who are the very reason the state of New
 
06:15:59.208 --> 06:15:59.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire initially passed the bill
 
06:16:01.490 --> 06:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
allowing medical cannabis patients to
 
06:16:03.410 --> 06:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
access this alternative treatment option
 
06:16:05.930 --> 06:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
so I asked that even for a moment you
 
06:16:07.368 --> 06:16:07.378 align:start position:0%
look at this bill and consider the
 
06:16:09.110 --> 06:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
impact it would have for the thousands
 
06:16:10.788 --> 06:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
of patients in the state
 
06:16:12.650 --> 06:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
with that being said I would like to
 
06:16:14.270 --> 06:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
note that these thoughts are solely mine
 
06:16:16.128 --> 06:16:16.138 align:start position:0%
and do not represent the thoughts of the
 
06:16:18.230 --> 06:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
company I work for
 
06:16:20.510 --> 06:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
I was diagnosed with depression and
 
06:16:22.310 --> 06:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
generalized anxiety disorder at the age
 
06:16:25.128 --> 06:16:25.138 align:start position:0%
of 14 and severe thoracic problems at
 
06:16:27.650 --> 06:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
the age of 20. I had tried various
 
06:16:29.810 --> 06:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals with minimal success and
 
06:16:32.330 --> 06:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
maximum side effects until I discovered
 
06:16:34.128 --> 06:16:34.138 align:start position:0%
my home state had a medical cannabis
 
06:16:36.948 --> 06:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
program within one year of becoming a
 
06:16:38.990 --> 06:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis patient not only did I
 
06:16:40.610 --> 06:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
start my dream job in the Cannabis
 
06:16:43.310 --> 06:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
industry but I also discontinued all use
 
06:16:46.010 --> 06:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
of pharmaceuticals lost over 40 pounds
 
06:16:48.110 --> 06:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
and felt more myself than I had felt
 
06:16:50.570 --> 06:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
since I was first diagnosed
 
06:16:52.490 --> 06:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
there are two reasons I would like to
 
06:16:54.230 --> 06:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
ask for your consideration in supporting
 
06:16:56.750 --> 06:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
this bill today lack of access to a
 
06:16:58.548 --> 06:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis facility and The Proven
 
06:17:01.430 --> 06:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
benefits of Horticultural therapy there
 
06:17:03.350 --> 06:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
are only I believe five dispensaries in
 
06:17:05.448 --> 06:17:05.458 align:start position:0%
the state at this point in time which
 
06:17:07.368 --> 06:17:07.378 align:start position:0%
means that patients in Pittsburgh must
 
06:17:09.410 --> 06:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
drive up to two and a half hours to
 
06:17:11.628 --> 06:17:11.638 align:start position:0%
reach their nearest dispensary
 
06:17:14.030 --> 06:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's a five hour round trip and to a
 
06:17:15.948 --> 06:17:15.958 align:start position:0%
patient with debilitating back pain or
 
06:17:17.930 --> 06:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
severe anxiety this can be an immense
 
06:17:19.788 --> 06:17:19.798 align:start position:0%
barrier to access
 
06:17:21.890 --> 06:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
let's just say that patient had young
 
06:17:24.410 --> 06:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
children and a full-time job finding the
 
06:17:26.150 --> 06:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
time to make that five hour drive would
 
06:17:28.610 --> 06:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
become an even larger barrier
 
06:17:30.708 --> 06:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
in addition to the patient who has found
 
06:17:33.110 --> 06:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
success with only a handful of strains
 
06:17:35.330 --> 06:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
due to the cannabinoid and terpenoid
 
06:17:37.430 --> 06:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
content none of which might be available
 
06:17:39.890 --> 06:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
at their nearest dispensary this can be
 
06:17:42.470 --> 06:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
an immense barrier to those of you who
 
06:17:44.690 --> 06:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
may not be as familiar with with the
 
06:17:46.788 --> 06:17:46.798 align:start position:0%
medicinal properties of cannabis there
 
06:17:48.830 --> 06:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
are both the cannabinoids like THC and
 
06:17:51.470 --> 06:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
CBD but there are also terpenes which
 
06:17:53.150 --> 06:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
are the essential oils found in there as
 
06:17:55.310 --> 06:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
well and they all work together to make
 
06:17:57.110 --> 06:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
every single strain different
 
06:17:58.910 --> 06:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
if you were to try a strain that worked
 
06:18:01.490 --> 06:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
perfectly for um let's just say your
 
06:18:04.128 --> 06:18:04.138 align:start position:0%
severe PTSD or your severe back problems
 
06:18:06.170 --> 06:18:06.180 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't at your nearest dispensary
 
06:18:08.090 --> 06:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
you may not find success with the other
 
06:18:09.770 --> 06:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
strains available
 
06:18:11.750 --> 06:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
now to those of you who may not be aware
 
06:18:13.670 --> 06:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
there is a practice called Horticultural
 
06:18:15.708 --> 06:18:15.718 align:start position:0%
therapy which is a form of therapy
 
06:18:17.570 --> 06:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
utilizing gardening growing vegetables
 
06:18:19.190 --> 06:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
fruits flowers and other plants for
 
06:18:21.770 --> 06:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
therapeutic purposes Studies have shown
 
06:18:23.868 --> 06:18:23.878 align:start position:0%
Horticultural therapy to improve quality
 
06:18:26.150 --> 06:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
of life for patients with dementia PTSD
 
06:18:28.430 --> 06:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
anxiety cancer and even for sexual
 
06:18:31.010 --> 06:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
assault survivors Horticultural therapy
 
06:18:33.170 --> 06:18:33.180 align:start position:0%
has been shown to help improve memory
 
06:18:35.570 --> 06:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
cognition task initiation coordination
 
06:18:38.150 --> 06:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
balance strength and endurance so
 
06:18:40.010 --> 06:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
imagine the benefits for the patients of
 
06:18:41.510 --> 06:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should you pass this bill
 
06:18:42.890 --> 06:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
and allow the option for home
 
06:18:42.900 --> 06:18:44.448 align:start position:0%
and allow the option for home
cultivation

06:18:44.448 --> 06:18:44.458 align:start position:0%
cultivation
 
06:18:46.430 --> 06:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
while patients living hours from their
 
06:18:48.048 --> 06:18:48.058 align:start position:0%
nearest dispensary could utilize home
 
06:18:49.850 --> 06:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
cultivation as their primary source of
 
06:18:52.730 --> 06:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
medicine those living nearby to an
 
06:18:54.650 --> 06:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment center could just
 
06:18:56.570 --> 06:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
grow one or two plants therapeutically
 
06:18:59.410 --> 06:18:59.420 align:start position:0%
while still supporting their local ATC
 
06:19:01.850 --> 06:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
that's what I have today but I wanted to
 
06:19:03.530 --> 06:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you all so much for your time and
 
06:19:05.390 --> 06:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
to let you know to please consider me as
 
06:19:06.830 --> 06:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
a resource should you have any other
 
06:19:08.690 --> 06:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
questions that I can be of assistance
 
06:19:08.700 --> 06:19:09.650 align:start position:0%
questions that I can be of assistance
with

06:19:09.650 --> 06:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:19:12.170 --> 06:19:12.180 align:start position:0%
thank you does anyone have any questions
 
06:19:17.208 --> 06:19:17.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:19.670 --> 06:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
06:19:35.750 --> 06:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:42.170 --> 06:19:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:42.180 --> 06:19:43.730 align:start position:0%
 
hello

06:19:43.730 --> 06:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
hello
 
06:19:49.190 --> 06:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:50.448 --> 06:19:50.458 align:start position:0%
hello everybody
 
06:19:52.910 --> 06:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for having me here today
 
06:19:55.070 --> 06:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
um I am a New Hampshire cannabis patient
 
06:19:55.080 --> 06:19:57.230 align:start position:0%
um I am a New Hampshire cannabis patient
I

06:19:57.230 --> 06:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:20:00.048 --> 06:20:00.058 align:start position:0%
have been following the story
 
06:20:03.590 --> 06:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
um since the legislation has started
 
06:20:06.590 --> 06:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of the medical cannabis reforms
 
06:20:06.600 --> 06:20:10.368 align:start position:0%
in terms of the medical cannabis reforms
specifically

06:20:10.368 --> 06:20:10.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:13.788 --> 06:20:13.798 align:start position:0%
very interested in how we can continue
 
06:20:18.170 --> 06:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
to work with local communities to help
 
06:20:20.810 --> 06:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
people that have debilitating illnesses
 
06:20:23.150 --> 06:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
and diseases acquired the right type of
 
06:20:25.610 --> 06:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
treatment that they need at a
 
06:20:29.270 --> 06:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
cost-effective measure as stated by
 
06:20:31.910 --> 06:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
other people previously it's very hard
 
06:20:33.670 --> 06:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
for patients that have these
 
06:20:36.890 --> 06:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
debilitating diseases to one be able to
 
06:20:39.770 --> 06:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
pay for everything when
 
06:20:44.208 --> 06:20:44.218 align:start position:0%
the cost for just a single ounce is is
 
06:20:47.090 --> 06:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
drastically higher in our our state and
 
06:20:48.830 --> 06:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
in one location
 
06:20:50.990 --> 06:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
um it's very hard again to rely on the
 
06:20:52.670 --> 06:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
strains that you're specifically looking
 
06:20:54.850 --> 06:20:54.860 align:start position:0%
for to treat your
 
06:20:57.708 --> 06:20:57.718 align:start position:0%
ailments or uh to treat anything
 
06:20:57.718 --> 06:20:59.208 align:start position:0%
ailments or uh to treat anything
specifically

06:20:59.208 --> 06:20:59.218 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
06:21:00.770 --> 06:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's difficult because we're
 
06:21:02.750 --> 06:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
getting to a point where in the
 
06:21:05.628 --> 06:21:05.638 align:start position:0%
hospitals we're not able to have a
 
06:21:08.990 --> 06:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
conversation or a solution around
 
06:21:11.270 --> 06:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
um what's the best best method as to
 
06:21:13.570 --> 06:21:13.580 align:start position:0%
getting people the treatment they need
 
06:21:16.670 --> 06:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
with the proper resources available
 
06:21:18.890 --> 06:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
there it's very hard
 
06:21:21.288 --> 06:21:21.298 align:start position:0%
pulling them all together when
 
06:21:24.230 --> 06:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
um again we have over policing uh still
 
06:21:25.970 --> 06:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
being an issue and it's not that we
 
06:21:27.470 --> 06:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
06:21:29.150 --> 06:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
um you know add more things to the bill
 
06:21:31.970 --> 06:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
as the police chief was saying we do
 
06:21:35.030 --> 06:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
want if needed uh to to have you know
 
06:21:36.948 --> 06:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
people come in and check just to make
 
06:21:38.750 --> 06:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
sure that things are going
 
06:21:40.250 --> 06:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
correctly and it would actually be even
 
06:21:42.890 --> 06:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
better if there was a program uh by the
 
06:21:46.010 --> 06:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
state to help patients or caregivers
 
06:21:50.030 --> 06:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
grow or to teach them more like more
 
06:21:52.548 --> 06:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
Horticulture classes or whatever is
 
06:21:54.470 --> 06:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
available just just more for the
 
06:21:56.690 --> 06:21:56.700 align:start position:0%
community so we can actually grow and
 
06:21:56.700 --> 06:21:58.190 align:start position:0%
community so we can actually grow and
continue

06:21:58.190 --> 06:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
continue
 
06:22:00.890 --> 06:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
um to push forward in these uh these
 
06:22:02.330 --> 06:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
hard times it's
 
06:22:04.430 --> 06:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
it's only made it more clear
 
06:22:06.770 --> 06:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
um that traveling out of state isn't an
 
06:22:09.170 --> 06:22:09.180 align:start position:0%
option anymore for these patients
 
06:22:12.110 --> 06:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
um originally this started with
 
06:22:15.288 --> 06:22:15.298 align:start position:0%
you know a woman suing the state for her
 
06:22:17.270 --> 06:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
right to just get a card so she can go
 
06:22:19.128 --> 06:22:19.138 align:start position:0%
to Maine to get medication that she
 
06:22:19.138 --> 06:22:20.448 align:start position:0%
to Maine to get medication that she
needed

06:22:20.448 --> 06:22:20.458 align:start position:0%
needed
 
06:22:23.330 --> 06:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
um and that's not an option anymore for
 
06:22:23.340 --> 06:22:24.230 align:start position:0%
um and that's not an option anymore for
anybody

06:22:24.230 --> 06:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
06:22:26.570 --> 06:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
even though the surrounding states are
 
06:22:29.628 --> 06:22:29.638 align:start position:0%
are legal um it's it's not wise for
 
06:22:31.310 --> 06:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
anybody to go out of state to travel
 
06:22:33.410 --> 06:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
with medication from a different state
 
06:22:35.930 --> 06:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
into your own State just based on the
 
06:22:37.788 --> 06:22:37.798 align:start position:0%
current legislation on a federal and
 
06:22:39.288 --> 06:22:39.298 align:start position:0%
state level
 
06:22:42.530 --> 06:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
so we still need a lot done that is
 
06:22:44.690 --> 06:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
obvious but the first step would still
 
06:22:46.850 --> 06:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
be to make sure that patients have the
 
06:22:46.860 --> 06:22:47.930 align:start position:0%
be to make sure that patients have the
right

06:22:47.930 --> 06:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:22:51.230 --> 06:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
or a right to grow the specific strains
 
06:22:53.448 --> 06:22:53.458 align:start position:0%
that they need in the smallest amounts
 
06:22:57.048 --> 06:22:57.058 align:start position:0%
possible because again the centers that
 
06:22:59.030 --> 06:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
are available
 
06:23:02.090 --> 06:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
we don't always have the amount that you
 
06:23:03.350 --> 06:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
can pick up for the strains that you
 
06:23:05.510 --> 06:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
need so again those
 
06:23:08.270 --> 06:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
those profiles on the strains that you
 
06:23:10.730 --> 06:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
need aren't aren't helping
 
06:23:10.740 --> 06:23:11.750 align:start position:0%
need aren't aren't helping
um

06:23:11.750 --> 06:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:15.650 --> 06:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a very tough issue I know
 
06:23:16.910 --> 06:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of different areas that
 
06:23:18.650 --> 06:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
we still need to work on but I hope that
 
06:23:20.390 --> 06:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
somehow we can figure out
 
06:23:22.788 --> 06:23:22.798 align:start position:0%
um how we can work together
 
06:23:24.770 --> 06:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
um not just on a state level but you
 
06:23:28.190 --> 06:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
know the whole North Northeast here uh
 
06:23:29.930 --> 06:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
to figure out what's the best method to
 
06:23:33.048 --> 06:23:33.058 align:start position:0%
try to you know alleviate some of the
 
06:23:34.910 --> 06:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
terminally ill people
 
06:23:36.890 --> 06:23:36.900 align:start position:0%
um and their treatment and the resources
 
06:23:38.930 --> 06:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
that are available that are just very
 
06:23:40.850 --> 06:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
hard for people to reach
 
06:23:42.708 --> 06:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
um and to pay for
 
06:23:45.770 --> 06:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
but I do think that allowing this bill
 
06:23:47.448 --> 06:23:47.458 align:start position:0%
to be passed would
 
06:23:50.448 --> 06:23:50.458 align:start position:0%
um again displace the illicit market and
 
06:23:53.930 --> 06:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
make sure that people have equal access
 
06:23:56.090 --> 06:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
um and a cheaper cost
 
06:23:56.100 --> 06:23:56.810 align:start position:0%
um and a cheaper cost
um

06:23:56.810 --> 06:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:59.930 --> 06:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
that would dramatically help their
 
06:24:02.390 --> 06:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
condition in the long term
 
06:24:04.910 --> 06:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
of life
 
06:24:07.970 --> 06:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Johnson for coming to
 
06:24:10.490 --> 06:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
testify before us
 
06:24:21.548 --> 06:24:21.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:25.250 --> 06:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me you can
 
06:24:28.070 --> 06:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
hi everyone thank you for being here my
 
06:24:30.530 --> 06:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
name is Lisa Powers I live in Manchester
 
06:24:34.070 --> 06:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I am a nurse a cannabis
 
06:24:36.230 --> 06:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
nurse a cannabis caregiver a cannabis
 
06:24:39.110 --> 06:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
patient I do teach people how to grow
 
06:24:41.750 --> 06:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
safely and just for the record you can
 
06:24:43.548 --> 06:24:43.558 align:start position:0%
get by with thirty dollars a month
 
06:24:45.770 --> 06:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
increase in your utility bills if you
 
06:24:47.810 --> 06:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
use the right kind of lighting three
 
06:24:49.368 --> 06:24:49.378 align:start position:0%
months of that you're under a hundred
 
06:24:51.230 --> 06:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
dollars and you can have several ounces
 
06:24:53.570 --> 06:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
of your medication that you need for
 
06:24:56.690 --> 06:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
your condition and if you do it outside
 
06:24:59.330 --> 06:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
very little cost and your plant can grow
 
06:25:03.288 --> 06:25:03.298 align:start position:0%
more for you outside typically so um I'm
 
06:25:05.270 --> 06:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
I'm in full support of the bill as you
 
06:25:07.670 --> 06:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
probably figured that out by now
 
06:25:10.430 --> 06:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
um hold on just a sec
 
06:25:13.128 --> 06:25:13.138 align:start position:0%
so I fully support this and I sent a
 
06:25:16.310 --> 06:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
testimony in and I did put a a little
 
06:25:19.430 --> 06:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
snippet of a cost of the amount that
 
06:25:20.810 --> 06:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
they charge for cannabis at the
 
06:25:22.430 --> 06:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
dispensaries because you can just go on
 
06:25:24.350 --> 06:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
Google and see that information in the
 
06:25:26.030 --> 06:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and many other
 
06:25:26.040 --> 06:25:27.948 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and many other
states

06:25:27.948 --> 06:25:27.958 align:start position:0%
states
 
06:25:30.590 --> 06:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
um as a nurse that supports people and
 
06:25:32.570 --> 06:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
how they use cannabis for their specific
 
06:25:34.368 --> 06:25:34.378 align:start position:0%
treatment options it's very important
 
06:25:36.470 --> 06:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
that they have education and they do it
 
06:25:39.650 --> 06:25:39.660 align:start position:0%
safely and I agree that testing would be
 
06:25:41.448 --> 06:25:41.458 align:start position:0%
great but that's going to be too costly
 
06:25:43.788 --> 06:25:43.798 align:start position:0%
and there's no at-home test kits just
 
06:25:46.070 --> 06:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
yet I'm sure that will be developed at
 
06:25:48.530 --> 06:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
some point but patients know when they
 
06:25:51.948 --> 06:25:51.958 align:start position:0%
plant a seed or acquire a clone of a
 
06:25:53.868 --> 06:25:53.878 align:start position:0%
specific strain they pretty much know a
 
06:25:55.730 --> 06:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
lot about it already because it's been
 
06:25:58.490 --> 06:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
heavily documented on leafly.com and
 
06:26:00.708 --> 06:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
other sources online where you can read
 
06:26:02.810 --> 06:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
about the common effects that that
 
06:26:05.390 --> 06:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis provides to many many people so
 
06:26:07.970 --> 06:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's another way that
 
06:26:11.030 --> 06:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis Growers can figure out what
 
06:26:13.128 --> 06:26:13.138 align:start position:0%
they're growing how strong is it and how
 
06:26:14.930 --> 06:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
much should they use so that that's not
 
06:26:19.010 --> 06:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
a big problem and what I'm seeing
 
06:26:21.590 --> 06:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and patients do need an ounce to
 
06:26:23.628 --> 06:26:23.638 align:start position:0%
maybe four ounces a month depending on
 
06:26:26.990 --> 06:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
their conditions and just as an example
 
06:26:30.170 --> 06:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
I have a female patient who reduced her
 
06:26:33.350 --> 06:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
opiate use by 80 percent and under 30
 
06:26:36.708 --> 06:26:36.718 align:start position:0%
days using medical cannabis she couldn't
 
06:26:38.570 --> 06:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
afford all that she needed but she went
 
06:26:40.548 --> 06:26:40.558 align:start position:0%
to Maine and other probably black market
 
06:26:42.230 --> 06:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know I try to stay out of that
 
06:26:45.770 --> 06:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
and she managed to do that she can have
 
06:26:48.470 --> 06:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
bowel movements again she is very happy
 
06:26:52.368 --> 06:26:52.378 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't stop people from having
 
06:26:54.590 --> 06:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
this medicine it's unethical and it's
 
06:26:56.990 --> 06:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
inhumane and that's my nursing
 
06:26:59.390 --> 06:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
perspective because of all the success
 
06:27:01.730 --> 06:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing we don't want to give it to
 
06:27:03.770 --> 06:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
the children unless well it's medically
 
06:27:06.230 --> 06:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
needed we don't want to divert we don't
 
06:27:08.868 --> 06:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
want to sell what we grow because we put
 
06:27:11.090 --> 06:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
our effort and our compassion into that
 
06:27:14.150 --> 06:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's made for us as patients we're not
 
06:27:16.128 --> 06:27:16.138 align:start position:0%
going to sell it we won't have enough to
 
06:27:18.590 --> 06:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
sell we need it for ourselves because if
 
06:27:20.868 --> 06:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
you harvest say you harvest and maybe
 
06:27:23.150 --> 06:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
you get 15 ounces
 
06:27:24.708 --> 06:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get rid of that
 
06:27:26.390 --> 06:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
because you need that for the whole year
 
06:27:28.670 --> 06:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
if you're only growing one time a year
 
06:27:31.430 --> 06:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm not worried about diversion like
 
06:27:34.548 --> 06:27:34.558 align:start position:0%
the police said and yeah the the police
 
06:27:38.390 --> 06:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
did say the word control many times I
 
06:27:41.570 --> 06:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
know they want to control cannabis but
 
06:27:43.788 --> 06:27:43.798 align:start position:0%
this is different guys this is medical
 
06:27:43.798 --> 06:27:44.990 align:start position:0%
this is different guys this is medical
needs

06:27:44.990 --> 06:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
needs
 
06:27:48.708 --> 06:27:48.718 align:start position:0%
the the police have control already well
 
06:27:50.330 --> 06:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't because cannabis is
 
06:27:52.970 --> 06:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
just everywhere you know but patients
 
06:27:55.128 --> 06:27:55.138 align:start position:0%
should have a right to grow their own
 
06:27:57.288 --> 06:27:57.298 align:start position:0%
plant their own medicine for the
 
06:27:59.750 --> 06:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
terpenes the flavonoids and cannabinoids
 
06:28:02.990 --> 06:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's all in my um written testimony if
 
06:28:04.490 --> 06:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
you want to see more details I'm not
 
06:28:07.010 --> 06:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
going to read it to you and I want you
 
06:28:08.868 --> 06:28:08.878 align:start position:0%

and I'm offering testimony as a bit of a
 
06:30:30.470 --> 06:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
subject matter expert on medical patient
 
06:30:32.288 --> 06:30:32.298 align:start position:0%
and adult use home grow in Massachusetts

in the event that anything that uh any
 
06:30:36.530 --> 06:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
lessons we might have learned might be

know this bill is multi-years-old at
 
06:30:41.510 --> 06:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
this point and there's a lot of support
 
06:30:43.548 --> 06:30:43.558 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping it will be passed in the
 
06:30:46.548 --> 06:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
short term so in Massachusetts uh
 
06:30:48.470 --> 06:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative the representative who
 
06:30:50.990 --> 06:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill HB 350 mentioned
 
06:30:53.448 --> 06:30:53.458 align:start position:0%
earlier we have six plants for home grow
 
06:30:55.970 --> 06:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
for adult use if you're over 21 12
 
06:30:57.890 --> 06:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
plants for home grow in a single home if
 
06:30:59.750 --> 06:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
you have two adults over 21 in the home
 
06:31:02.628 --> 06:31:02.638 align:start position:0%
our medical homegirl actually just got
 
06:31:05.270 --> 06:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
expanded after three years as we had so
 
06:31:07.730 --> 06:31:07.740 align:start position:0%
few issues with it medical patients in
 
06:31:09.708 --> 06:31:09.718 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts without a hardship grow
 
06:31:13.190 --> 06:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
license can now grow 12 flowering plants
 
06:31:16.250 --> 06:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
which is a mature plant and 12 immature
 
06:31:18.470 --> 06:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
plants and they can have unlimited
 
06:31:20.690 --> 06:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
clones just by having their medical card
 
06:31:22.970 --> 06:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
and that happened as a result of the
 
06:31:24.590 --> 06:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
fact that there were so few incidents
 
06:31:26.810 --> 06:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
related to home grow and one thing I
 
06:31:28.548 --> 06:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
will say Mr chair through you to the
 
06:31:30.708 --> 06:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
committee is in response to testimony
 
06:31:33.410 --> 06:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
from earlier it just does not follow
 
06:31:35.690 --> 06:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
naturally based on human patterns of
 
06:31:38.330 --> 06:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
behavior that someone who is growing
 
06:31:40.548 --> 06:31:40.558 align:start position:0%
cannabis at their home giving all of
 
06:31:42.170 --> 06:31:42.180 align:start position:0%
their information over to the state
 
06:31:44.208 --> 06:31:44.218 align:start position:0%
putting that information in a database
 
06:31:46.070 --> 06:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
and basically putting a big red X on
 
06:31:48.230 --> 06:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
their back would then go on to divert
 
06:31:49.788 --> 06:31:49.798 align:start position:0%
the small amount of cannabis that they'd
 
06:31:52.128 --> 06:31:52.138 align:start position:0%
be able to grow under this bill one
 
06:31:53.690 --> 06:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
thing I will also note to the committee
 
06:31:56.270 --> 06:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
is related to the caregiver provision so
 
06:31:57.948 --> 06:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
caregivers in your bill now can only
 
06:32:00.110 --> 06:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
grow for one patient at a time and then
 
06:32:02.750 --> 06:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
can go to atcs for up to nine patients
 
06:32:03.890 --> 06:32:03.900 align:start position:0%
depending on where they live
 
06:32:06.230 --> 06:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts just increased the number
 
06:32:08.390 --> 06:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
of patients that a caregiver can grow
 
06:32:11.030 --> 06:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
for at any one time from one patient to
 
06:32:13.310 --> 06:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
five patients because because what
 
06:32:14.868 --> 06:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts found was there were a lot
 
06:32:16.730 --> 06:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
of patients who could not grow their own
 
06:32:18.830 --> 06:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
due to either lack of space or lack of
 
06:32:20.990 --> 06:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
Technical know-how and those caregivers
 
06:32:23.390 --> 06:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
became a vital resource for access to
 
06:32:26.030 --> 06:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis at accessible prices and I
 
06:32:28.070 --> 06:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
myself saw that firsthand I felt
 
06:32:29.750 --> 06:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
disabled while in graduate school in
 
06:32:29.760 --> 06:32:30.788 align:start position:0%
disabled while in graduate school in
2014

06:32:30.788 --> 06:32:30.798 align:start position:0%
2014
 
06:32:33.170 --> 06:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
after I felt disabled I was in the
 
06:32:34.670 --> 06:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
hospital for 18 months and on a
 
06:32:35.930 --> 06:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of narcotic
 
06:32:38.390 --> 06:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
medication within 30 days of starting
 
06:32:40.490 --> 06:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis I saw that narcotic
 
06:32:42.470 --> 06:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
usage drop by 30 percent and within 12
 
06:32:44.810 --> 06:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
months I was narcotic-free so thank you
 
06:32:46.190 --> 06:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
very much for your time and I'm happy to
 
06:32:48.530 --> 06:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
answer any questions Mr chairman
 
06:32:51.650 --> 06:32:51.660 align:start position:0%
any question questions from Mr Ellis
 
06:32:51.660 --> 06:32:55.368 align:start position:0%
any question questions from Mr Ellis
yes

06:32:55.368 --> 06:32:55.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:57.410 --> 06:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:32:59.750 --> 06:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
taking this question Mr Ellis
 
06:32:59.760 --> 06:33:00.708 align:start position:0%
taking this question Mr Ellis
um

06:33:00.708 --> 06:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:02.628 --> 06:33:02.638 align:start position:0%
I'm a little embarrassed to ask somebody
 
06:33:04.788 --> 06:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts about the specifics
 
06:33:09.110 --> 06:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
of our bill but
 
06:33:11.628 --> 06:33:11.638 align:start position:0%
in listening to
 
06:33:13.430 --> 06:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
um the chief from the police Chiefs
 
06:33:16.730 --> 06:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
Association and trying to quickly read
 
06:33:18.590 --> 06:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
through the bill
 
06:33:18.600 --> 06:33:19.548 align:start position:0%
through the bill
um

06:33:19.548 --> 06:33:19.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:23.270 --> 06:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's unclear to me in this bill or in
 
06:33:25.788 --> 06:33:25.798 align:start position:0%
your statutes in Massachusetts if
 
06:33:28.250 --> 06:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
someone is
 
06:33:31.490 --> 06:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
growing cannabis at home for medical use
 
06:33:35.570 --> 06:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
do they have to register that with the
 
06:33:39.650 --> 06:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
state and if so
 
06:33:45.288 --> 06:33:45.298 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that um contradict what um
 
06:33:48.650 --> 06:33:48.660 align:start position:0%
law enforcement's concern about it being
 
06:33:51.590 --> 06:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
completely unregulated
 
06:33:55.128 --> 06:33:55.138 align:start position:0%
Mr chair through you thank you for the
 
06:33:57.410 --> 06:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
06:34:01.090 --> 06:34:01.100 align:start position:0%
um the the New Hampshire bill I believe
 
06:34:03.530 --> 06:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
provides for registration of the
 
06:34:05.930 --> 06:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
caregiver and the patient and then
 
06:34:07.850 --> 06:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
indicates where the grow will take place
 
06:34:10.368 --> 06:34:10.378 align:start position:0%
as it may only be at the home of the
 
06:34:11.868 --> 06:34:11.878 align:start position:0%
registered patient or caregiver
 
06:34:15.770 --> 06:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for home grow goes a
 
06:34:17.750 --> 06:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
little bit beyond that and what we
 
06:34:19.788 --> 06:34:19.798 align:start position:0%
actually have is if you want to just
 
06:34:22.250 --> 06:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
grow for yourself at home either as a
 
06:34:24.230 --> 06:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
medical patient with that 24 plant cap
 
06:34:26.510 --> 06:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
or as an adult use home grow you don't
 
06:34:27.890 --> 06:34:27.900 align:start position:0%
have to do anything you don't have to
 
06:34:29.330 --> 06:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
register it you don't have to be in the
 
06:34:31.190 --> 06:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
system if you're a medical patient you
 
06:34:32.628 --> 06:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
have to be in the system but if you want
 
06:34:34.310 --> 06:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
to grow more than that if you need a
 
06:34:35.810 --> 06:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
hardship or if you're a caregiver
 
06:34:37.788 --> 06:34:37.798 align:start position:0%
growing for more than one patient you
 
06:34:39.048 --> 06:34:39.058 align:start position:0%
then have to get an electrical
 
06:34:41.690 --> 06:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
inspection a fire inspection and then
 
06:34:44.208 --> 06:34:44.218 align:start position:0%
provide handwritten records for the cost
 
06:34:46.070 --> 06:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
that you put into your grow for
 
06:34:48.590 --> 06:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
inspection by the commission but I think
 
06:34:50.810 --> 06:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
the distinction there is the size of the
 
06:34:53.990 --> 06:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
grow so grow below 6 to 12 plants where
 
06:34:56.030 --> 06:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
the person's name and address are on
 
06:34:57.288 --> 06:34:57.298 align:start position:0%
file with the state through the medical
 
06:34:59.930 --> 06:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
program I don't think that extra level
 
06:35:07.010 --> 06:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:12.948 --> 06:35:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:16.788 --> 06:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Ellis thank you Mr chair
 
06:35:19.788 --> 06:35:19.798 align:start position:0%
the last name I have on the list is Matt
 
06:35:19.798 --> 06:35:25.490 align:start position:0%
the last name I have on the list is Matt
Simon

06:35:25.490 --> 06:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:29.628 --> 06:35:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:31.310 --> 06:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record
 
06:35:34.250 --> 06:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
Matt Simon I live in Manchester and I
 
06:35:35.868 --> 06:35:35.878 align:start position:0%
work for the marijuana policy project
 
06:35:38.208 --> 06:35:38.218 align:start position:0%
we're a non-profit dedicated to cannabis
 
06:35:39.650 --> 06:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
policy reform
 
06:35:41.330 --> 06:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
I've been coming before this committee
 
06:35:44.868 --> 06:35:44.878 align:start position:0%
for the last 14 years often with a
 
06:35:47.270 --> 06:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
number of patients who who then
 
06:35:49.730 --> 06:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
testified and I would strongly encourage
 
06:35:51.948 --> 06:35:51.958 align:start position:0%
the committee to continue
 
06:35:54.490 --> 06:35:54.500 align:start position:0%
The house's long-standing policy of
 
06:35:57.288 --> 06:35:57.298 align:start position:0%
supporting bills that would legalize own
 
06:35:59.270 --> 06:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
cultivation of cannabis for registered
 
06:36:02.330 --> 06:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
patients and caregivers so for the last
 
06:36:04.310 --> 06:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
15 years patients have been testifying
 
06:36:06.230 --> 06:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
in this committee seeking permission to
 
06:36:08.030 --> 06:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
grow their own cannabis without risking
 
06:36:11.090 --> 06:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
rest and felony prosecution it is
 
06:36:12.948 --> 06:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
currently a felony for any New Hampshire
 
06:36:17.448 --> 06:36:17.458 align:start position:0%
resident to grow even a single plant
 
06:36:19.490 --> 06:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
um the house has consistently supported
 
06:36:22.190 --> 06:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
that position since 2009 and I did email
 
06:36:24.590 --> 06:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
you a one-pager that lists all the bills
 
06:36:27.110 --> 06:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
that have passed often with the support
 
06:36:29.510 --> 06:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
of this committee sometimes despite the
 
06:36:31.070 --> 06:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
lack of support from this committee but
 
06:36:33.470 --> 06:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
it's always past the house floor when
 
06:36:36.650 --> 06:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
it's failed it has been somewhere else
 
06:36:36.660 --> 06:36:37.490 align:start position:0%
it's failed it has been somewhere else
um

06:36:37.490 --> 06:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:39.708 --> 06:36:39.718 align:start position:0%
so in light of that history I believe it
 
06:36:42.110 --> 06:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
would be unconscious unconscionable for
 
06:36:44.270 --> 06:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
this committee to do anything other than
 
06:36:47.750 --> 06:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
to vote ought to pass on HB 350. eight
 
06:36:49.128 --> 06:36:49.138 align:start position:0%
years following the passage of New
 
06:36:50.448 --> 06:36:50.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's therapeutic cannabis law
 
06:36:52.368 --> 06:36:52.378 align:start position:0%
patients are still complaining about
 
06:36:55.788 --> 06:36:55.798 align:start position:0%
insufficient Mission access product
 
06:36:57.830 --> 06:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
selection and lack of affordability
 
06:37:00.230 --> 06:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
since home cultivation is currently a
 
06:37:02.030 --> 06:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
felony many patients have been traveling
 
06:37:04.190 --> 06:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
to Maine in order to obtain products
 
06:37:06.170 --> 06:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
they need at prices they can afford and
 
06:37:07.850 --> 06:37:07.860 align:start position:0%
many patients have moved out of the
 
06:37:10.250 --> 06:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and in order to
 
06:37:12.530 --> 06:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
live in a place where they feel safer
 
06:37:15.890 --> 06:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
and less likely to be oppressed by
 
06:37:18.890 --> 06:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
people wearing Badges and carrying guns
 
06:37:20.930 --> 06:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
today cultivation of cannabis is legal
 
06:37:22.730 --> 06:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
in all four neighboring jurisdictions
 
06:37:24.708 --> 06:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
not only for patients and caregivers but
 
06:37:26.090 --> 06:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
for all adults
 
06:37:28.070 --> 06:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
and there is simply no excuse for
 
06:37:30.230 --> 06:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
maintaining criminal penalties to punish
 
06:37:32.390 --> 06:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
limited home cultivation by patients and
 
06:37:35.448 --> 06:37:35.458 align:start position:0%
caregivers in the live fear dye State HB
 
06:37:38.330 --> 06:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
350 does not need additional work and it
 
06:37:40.910 --> 06:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
does not require further study it only
 
06:37:42.410 --> 06:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
needs to pass
 
06:37:44.208 --> 06:37:44.218 align:start position:0%
finally with regard to the police
 
06:37:45.948 --> 06:37:45.958 align:start position:0%
chief's testimony I'd just like to
 
06:37:48.110 --> 06:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
remind you the police Chiefs Association
 
06:37:50.390 --> 06:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
has opposed to every medical cannabis
 
06:37:53.868 --> 06:37:53.878 align:start position:0%
bill up to its passage in 2013 they've
 
06:37:55.548 --> 06:37:55.558 align:start position:0%
opposed every home cultivation Bill
 
06:37:57.770 --> 06:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
since they opposed any form of
 
06:37:59.868 --> 06:37:59.878 align:start position:0%
decriminalization until the legislature
 
06:38:01.448 --> 06:38:01.458 align:start position:0%
finally passed it in
 
06:38:05.448 --> 06:38:05.458 align:start position:0%
2017. they oppose any bill period that
 
06:38:08.628 --> 06:38:08.638 align:start position:0%
seeks to improve cannabis policies in
 
06:38:10.850 --> 06:38:10.860 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire the last
 
06:38:12.890 --> 06:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
thing that patients need is for police
 
06:38:15.048 --> 06:38:15.058 align:start position:0%
officers to enter their homes to inspect
 
06:38:18.410 --> 06:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
their plants weigh their cannabis
 
06:38:19.910 --> 06:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
that is the last thing that somebody
 
06:38:22.010 --> 06:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
who's battling a serious medical
 
06:38:24.288 --> 06:38:24.298 align:start position:0%
condition needs to have happen to them
 
06:38:27.230 --> 06:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
in their own homes and as the previous
 
06:38:29.270 --> 06:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
speaker noted the cultivation location
 
06:38:32.810 --> 06:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
must be reported to the department DHHS
 
06:38:36.590 --> 06:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
will know who's growing and for whom but
 
06:38:39.230 --> 06:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
law enforcement only gets involved and
 
06:38:40.310 --> 06:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
this is something that we had to work
 
06:38:42.288 --> 06:38:42.298 align:start position:0%
out details of when the original
 
06:38:44.810 --> 06:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis will pass
 
06:38:46.548 --> 06:38:46.558 align:start position:0%
the police Chiefs wanted to be able to
 
06:38:48.288 --> 06:38:48.298 align:start position:0%
search that registry they wanted to be
 
06:38:50.448 --> 06:38:50.458 align:start position:0%
able to go check on anybody and make
 
06:38:52.910 --> 06:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
sure they're complying and that law had
 
06:38:54.530 --> 06:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
to be written very carefully to protect
 
06:38:56.990 --> 06:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
patient privacy so that law enforcement
 
06:38:58.610 --> 06:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
could only get involved when there was
 
06:39:00.708 --> 06:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
evidence of some kind of problem that
 
06:39:02.448 --> 06:39:02.458 align:start position:0%
indicated potential criminal activity
 
06:39:04.850 --> 06:39:04.860 align:start position:0%
and so I would encourage you to pass
 
06:39:08.230 --> 06:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
this bill as quickly as possible let's
 
06:39:11.270 --> 06:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
have the state live up to its motto with
 
06:39:13.788 --> 06:39:13.798 align:start position:0%
regard to home cultivation of
 
06:39:16.250 --> 06:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis I'd be happy to
 
06:39:17.990 --> 06:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
06:39:24.590 --> 06:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:27.890 --> 06:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
seeing no thank you for your testimony
 
06:39:37.250 --> 06:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:40.368 --> 06:39:40.378 align:start position:0%
hi can you hear me yeah yeah thank you
 
06:39:43.250 --> 06:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
my name is and I'm speaking on behalf of
 
06:39:46.250 --> 06:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
Rights and democracy New Hampshire
 
06:39:48.170 --> 06:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
um I will keep this short
 
06:39:50.930 --> 06:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
um y'all I don't know what to say about
 
06:39:53.690 --> 06:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
this bill except um it shouldn't be a
 
06:39:56.150 --> 06:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
controversial Bill uh this is a way for
 
06:39:58.490 --> 06:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
people to afford their medicine you
 
06:39:58.500 --> 06:39:59.390 align:start position:0%
people to afford their medicine you
heard

06:39:59.390 --> 06:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
heard
 
06:40:01.128 --> 06:40:01.138 align:start position:0%
um that there are therapeutic aspects
 
06:40:02.868 --> 06:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
there's medicinal aspects you heard
 
06:40:04.730 --> 06:40:04.740 align:start position:0%
people shouldn't need to drive close to
 
06:40:07.670 --> 06:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
two hours to get to a dispensary you
 
06:40:09.470 --> 06:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
heard about this working fine in
 
06:40:11.810 --> 06:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so I can't understand why
 
06:40:13.910 --> 06:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
anyone would vote against this people
 
06:40:16.310 --> 06:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
don't um we don't deserve to have a wall
 
06:40:18.708 --> 06:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
between a patient and their medicine
 
06:40:20.030 --> 06:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
um let's talk about the fact that if you
 
06:40:21.530 --> 06:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
vote against this you're keeping people
 
06:40:25.368 --> 06:40:25.378 align:start position:0%
from stopping anxiety or from keeping
 
06:40:27.230 --> 06:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
um physical pain away right that
 
06:40:29.868 --> 06:40:29.878 align:start position:0%
cannabis treats for Sleep problems or
 
06:40:31.850 --> 06:40:31.860 align:start position:0%
the many many other reasons why people
 
06:40:34.850 --> 06:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
need medicinal cannabis but can't drive
 
06:40:36.770 --> 06:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
one or two hours to get to their
 
06:40:36.780 --> 06:40:38.030 align:start position:0%
one or two hours to get to their
medicine

06:40:38.030 --> 06:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
06:40:39.708 --> 06:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
um and I mean do you think it's okay to
 
06:40:41.510 --> 06:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
travel for for your medicine when you
 
06:40:43.128 --> 06:40:43.138 align:start position:0%
get medicine right or do you have the
 
06:40:46.310 --> 06:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
decency and deserve medicine not too far
 
06:40:47.810 --> 06:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
away from you
 
06:40:49.670 --> 06:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah and just want to say people grow
 
06:40:51.770 --> 06:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
herbs I know the police officers said oh
 
06:40:53.868 --> 06:40:53.878 align:start position:0%
people aren't no people grow herbs for
 
06:40:55.548 --> 06:40:55.558 align:start position:0%
medicinal reasons and there's many
 
06:40:56.868 --> 06:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
different herbs that people grow in
 
06:40:58.788 --> 06:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
their Gardens that help them so this is
 
06:41:00.470 --> 06:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
no different so do the ethical thing
 
06:41:02.150 --> 06:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
please and pass this bill already the
 
06:41:03.708 --> 06:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire deserve this
 
06:41:06.048 --> 06:41:06.058 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
06:41:12.170 --> 06:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:23.930 --> 06:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:25.970 --> 06:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
hello thank you very much for your time
 
06:41:28.190 --> 06:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
my name is Ellen Brown I am a United
 
06:41:30.830 --> 06:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
States Air Force veteran and I am also a
 
06:41:32.628 --> 06:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana patient in the state
 
06:41:35.030 --> 06:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts and I have been a
 
06:41:37.610 --> 06:41:37.620 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana patient since 2010.
 
06:41:39.708 --> 06:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is once I got out of
 
06:41:42.170 --> 06:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
the service I moved home to my home
 
06:41:44.208 --> 06:41:44.218 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts and there wasn't
 
06:41:47.930 --> 06:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
a medical marijuana program and it
 
06:41:50.270 --> 06:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't home grow so I moved out to
 
06:41:52.190 --> 06:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
California where they had a functioning
 
06:41:54.650 --> 06:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana program hear me I
 
06:41:56.810 --> 06:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
moved from Massachusetts to California
 
06:41:58.910 --> 06:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to obtain my
 
06:42:01.490 --> 06:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
cannabis safety in order to be able to
 
06:42:03.650 --> 06:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
get the cannabinoids and the terpenes
 
06:42:05.510 --> 06:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
that I needed and from moving out to
 
06:42:07.910 --> 06:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
California to a state that did allow for
 
06:42:10.010 --> 06:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
home cultivation I got my medical
 
06:42:12.110 --> 06:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
marijuana card and within a week I was
 
06:42:13.850 --> 06:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
able to start growing my own plants at
 
06:42:15.770 --> 06:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
home and it was a beautiful wonderful
 
06:42:18.530 --> 06:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
experience I don't want to reiterate a
 
06:42:20.510 --> 06:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
lot of what we've heard today except to
 
06:42:23.090 --> 06:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
say that I completely support all of the
 
06:42:25.368 --> 06:42:25.378 align:start position:0%
wonderful facts information that has
 
06:42:29.150 --> 06:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
been presented in support of um House
 
06:42:32.330 --> 06:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
Bill 350 when we talk about the
 
06:42:34.128 --> 06:42:34.138 align:start position:0%
importance of having patients cultivate
 
06:42:35.448 --> 06:42:35.458 align:start position:0%
so that they can have the best
 
06:42:37.430 --> 06:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids and terpene profiles
 
06:42:40.850 --> 06:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
available for them and whatever their
 
06:42:44.170 --> 06:42:44.180 align:start position:0%
ailmenting condition might be as well as
 
06:42:47.270 --> 06:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
the importance of talking about therapy
 
06:42:48.948 --> 06:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
for cultivating
 
06:42:51.170 --> 06:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
um as a as a veteran and working with
 
06:42:53.330 --> 06:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
the veteran population it is very
 
06:42:55.970 --> 06:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
therapeutic to be able to cultivate your
 
06:42:57.948 --> 06:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
own cannabis at home and to be able to
 
06:43:00.530 --> 06:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
grow what you need and to be able to
 
06:43:03.170 --> 06:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
have that freedom to do so I think is
 
06:43:04.788 --> 06:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
very important
 
06:43:04.798 --> 06:43:05.510 align:start position:0%
very important
um

06:43:05.510 --> 06:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:07.310 --> 06:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
what's going on right now in New
 
06:43:09.288 --> 06:43:09.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where you only have five
 
06:43:11.030 --> 06:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
dispensaries is something that you need
 
06:43:13.070 --> 06:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
to look into as well
 
06:43:14.750 --> 06:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
um we are you know looking into
 
06:43:16.730 --> 06:43:16.740 align:start position:0%
expanding home cultivation but I do
 
06:43:19.670 --> 06:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
think that the um medical marijuana
 
06:43:22.910 --> 06:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
population is no disrespect but being
 
06:43:25.430 --> 06:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
clearly underserved if you have five
 
06:43:27.288 --> 06:43:27.298 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar dispensaries and no way
 
06:43:29.330 --> 06:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
for cool for patients to cultivate for
 
06:43:31.850 --> 06:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
themselves New Hampshire is a state that
 
06:43:34.010 --> 06:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
their motto is live free and die and
 
06:43:35.810 --> 06:43:35.820 align:start position:0%
something I would like to talk about is
 
06:43:38.208 --> 06:43:38.218 align:start position:0%
the importance of cannabis for
 
06:43:42.110 --> 06:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
palliative care and for myself
 
06:43:44.570 --> 06:43:44.580 align:start position:0%
um my mother passed away
 
06:43:48.110 --> 06:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
um five years ago and she was in the
 
06:43:49.430 --> 06:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire she lived in
 
06:43:52.190 --> 06:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
Nashua and this was back before your
 
06:43:53.930 --> 06:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana program was in effect
 
06:43:57.470 --> 06:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
and just for myself for somebody who has
 
06:43:59.208 --> 06:43:59.218 align:start position:0%
done hospice care and taking care of
 
06:44:01.430 --> 06:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
somebody who cannabis absolutely could
 
06:44:03.350 --> 06:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
have helped and benefited but it wasn't
 
06:44:05.448 --> 06:44:05.458 align:start position:0%
available at the time my heart
 
06:44:07.490 --> 06:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
definitely breaks for those that find
 
06:44:09.410 --> 06:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
themselves in a position where they have
 
06:44:12.048 --> 06:44:12.058 align:start position:0%
to go to Alternative States or they have
 
06:44:12.058 --> 06:44:12.948 align:start position:0%
to go to Alternative States or they have
to

06:44:12.948 --> 06:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:44:15.230 --> 06:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
um you know pick between am I going to
 
06:44:17.270 --> 06:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
be able to pay a bill versus pay for
 
06:44:19.850 --> 06:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
medicine so um by allowing for home
 
06:44:21.830 --> 06:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
cultivation those would help to
 
06:44:23.930 --> 06:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
alleviate those problems and to better
 
06:44:27.350 --> 06:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
serve the medical marijuana Community to
 
06:44:30.048 --> 06:44:30.058 align:start position:0%
better serve the patient population we
 
06:44:32.570 --> 06:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
always need to act with compassion and
 
06:44:34.190 --> 06:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
we always need to take those that are
 
06:44:36.770 --> 06:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable into consideration
 
06:44:39.170 --> 06:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
those that are unable to drive for
 
06:44:41.690 --> 06:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
themselves those that are unable to pay
 
06:44:44.150 --> 06:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
those dispensary prices and how home
 
06:44:47.150 --> 06:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
cultivation could improve quality of
 
06:44:49.670 --> 06:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
life and you right now have the
 
06:44:52.910 --> 06:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to pass the bill as it is I
 
06:44:55.610 --> 06:44:55.620 align:start position:0%
agree with the last speaker without any
 
06:44:58.670 --> 06:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
um debate or looking for
 
06:45:02.810 --> 06:45:02.820 align:start position:0%
um you know extra to add into it just as
 
06:45:05.448 --> 06:45:05.458 align:start position:0%
is passing this bill so that way we can
 
06:45:07.368 --> 06:45:07.378 align:start position:0%
get on the right track to providing
 
06:45:09.830 --> 06:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
those patients with the access they so
 
06:45:11.390 --> 06:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
desperately need
 
06:45:13.128 --> 06:45:13.138 align:start position:0%
um I truly appreciate you taking the
 
06:45:15.948 --> 06:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
time to hear my testimony I also hold
 
06:45:17.868 --> 06:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
educational seminars in Massachusetts
 
06:45:19.670 --> 06:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
and I'll put that into my written
 
06:45:22.548 --> 06:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
testimony but I'm here to help other
 
06:45:24.230 --> 06:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
people are here to help you have a great
 
06:45:26.930 --> 06:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
network of resources that are ready
 
06:45:29.628 --> 06:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
willing and able to help you for free to
 
06:45:31.548 --> 06:45:31.558 align:start position:0%
help those patients so thank you very
 
06:45:34.310 --> 06:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
much for your time coming to the end of
 
06:45:36.890 --> 06:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
our hour and we've got one more name

two fun and it would be Heather and Joe
 
06:45:44.930 --> 06:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
pinto and I'd ask you please to be brief
 
06:45:48.350 --> 06:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
because we're coming here to the end
 
06:45:53.868 --> 06:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:58.490 --> 06:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:00.948 --> 06:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
um so I apologize I don't know what
 
06:46:02.930 --> 06:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
happened earlier but if it's all right
 
06:46:09.730 --> 06:46:09.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:12.590 --> 06:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
all right well my name is Heather Marie
 
06:46:16.430 --> 06:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
Brown I have been a lifelong resident of
 
06:46:18.170 --> 06:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
06:46:20.628 --> 06:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
um I am a therapeutic cannabis patient
 
06:46:23.930 --> 06:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
and have been for several years now I am
 
06:46:28.788 --> 06:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of house bill 350.
 
06:46:31.010 --> 06:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
um I you know I heard some comments
 
06:46:32.868 --> 06:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
earlier in questions in reference to
 
06:46:36.410 --> 06:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
cost affiliated with this and I just
 
06:46:39.948 --> 06:46:39.958 align:start position:0%
want to let you know I myself it would
 
06:46:42.650 --> 06:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
be nothing but an outside grower which
 
06:46:45.110 --> 06:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
means I have a very limited season in
 
06:46:49.310 --> 06:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
order to produce what I need for myself
 
06:46:51.530 --> 06:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
um it's approximately three months I
 
06:46:53.208 --> 06:46:53.218 align:start position:0%
mean you guys some of you are gardeners
 
06:46:54.948 --> 06:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you're aware of our growing
 
06:46:56.690 --> 06:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
season and the way it is
 
06:47:00.110 --> 06:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
if if I were to be successful and
 
06:47:04.850 --> 06:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
acquire what I could acquire per plant
 
06:47:06.590 --> 06:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
um it would cost me an initial
 
06:47:09.730 --> 06:47:09.740 align:start position:0%
investment of approximately 100 150
 
06:47:13.250 --> 06:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
which would bring the cost of each ounce
 
06:47:17.810 --> 06:47:17.820 align:start position:0%
down to five dollars an ounce and that's
 
06:47:22.128 --> 06:47:22.138 align:start position:0%
only if the plant provided me with
 
06:47:25.010 --> 06:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
approximately four to five ounces per
 
06:47:28.368 --> 06:47:28.378 align:start position:0%
plant and has a lot of you know from
 
06:47:30.170 --> 06:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
growing outside that is not always
 
06:47:32.150 --> 06:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
possible to get the yield that we want
 
06:47:34.310 --> 06:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
from our garden
 
06:47:36.110 --> 06:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
um I also want to give you a couple of
 
06:47:39.830 --> 06:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
other facts my income is only
 
06:47:43.070 --> 06:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
approximately 20 000 per year
 
06:47:47.030 --> 06:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
of that I currently pay sixteen thousand
 
06:47:50.810 --> 06:47:50.820 align:start position:0%
eight hundred in rent I pay 2400 in
 
06:47:54.368 --> 06:47:54.378 align:start position:0%
electric and I pay 1200 in heat per year
 
06:47:58.310 --> 06:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
just those three utilities come to
 
06:48:01.070 --> 06:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand four hundred dollars per
 
06:48:03.170 --> 06:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
year as you can see that's four hundred
 
06:48:06.288 --> 06:48:06.298 align:start position:0%
dollars over my income in order for me
 
06:48:09.048 --> 06:48:09.058 align:start position:0%
to supply myself with cannabis I am
 
06:48:12.170 --> 06:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
looking at an expense of spending eight
 
06:48:15.170 --> 06:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
thousand four hundred dollars a year
 
06:48:17.930 --> 06:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
now from those numbers I just gave you
 
06:48:19.850 --> 06:48:19.860 align:start position:0%
where am I supposed to pull eight
 
06:48:21.590 --> 06:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
thousand four hundred dollars a year
 
06:48:25.670 --> 06:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
from it's impossible uh I found it very
 
06:48:29.510 --> 06:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to be able to get what I need
 
06:48:31.910 --> 06:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
to take care of myself for my own health
 
06:48:31.920 --> 06:48:33.708 align:start position:0%
to take care of myself for my own health
conditions

06:48:33.708 --> 06:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
06:48:36.350 --> 06:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
um and because of the location of my
 
06:48:38.448 --> 06:48:38.458 align:start position:0%
dispensary which is over an hour away
 
06:48:41.330 --> 06:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
and the fact that I have children it
 
06:48:44.270 --> 06:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
cost me approximately sixty dollars in
 
06:48:46.548 --> 06:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
order to even just take a trip to the
 
06:48:50.390 --> 06:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
dispensary based on gas child care and
 
06:48:53.810 --> 06:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
some of the other added things and
 
06:48:56.090 --> 06:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
um then you know you're looking at seven
 
06:48:59.208 --> 06:48:59.218 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars for me because I use a
 
06:49:02.208 --> 06:49:02.218 align:start position:0%
THC CBD blend so I would need one ounce
 
06:49:04.850 --> 06:49:04.860 align:start position:0%
of each and with the discount it's still
 
06:49:08.990 --> 06:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
350 dollars an ounce it's still 700 a
 
06:49:11.208 --> 06:49:11.218 align:start position:0%
month potentially
 
06:49:14.868 --> 06:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
um currently I do have a caregiver who
 
06:49:17.868 --> 06:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
lives approximately 35 to 40 minutes
 
06:49:21.288 --> 06:49:21.298 align:start position:0%
away from me in Maine where I can
 
06:49:24.530 --> 06:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
acquire my medical grade cannabis for
 
06:49:26.750 --> 06:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
approximately a hundred and fifty
 
06:49:26.760 --> 06:49:28.670 align:start position:0%
approximately a hundred and fifty
dollars

06:49:28.670 --> 06:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
06:49:30.410 --> 06:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
um you know I may still have the
 
06:49:32.628 --> 06:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
expenses involved with child care but
 
06:49:34.910 --> 06:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
I'm spending less time on the road I'm
 
06:49:38.030 --> 06:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
spending less money on a product and I'm
 
06:49:40.010 --> 06:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
getting the same quality as I would
 
06:49:42.468 --> 06:49:42.478 align:start position:0%
receive in the state of New Hampshire it
 
06:49:45.590 --> 06:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
would be an absolutely ridiculous thing
 
06:49:49.968 --> 06:49:49.978 align:start position:0%
for you guys not to pass this bill it
 
06:49:54.468 --> 06:49:54.478 align:start position:0%
has been it's time I am not a criminal
 
06:49:56.990 --> 06:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm sick and tired of feeling like I
 
06:50:00.350 --> 06:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
am a criminal in my state and as far as
 
06:50:02.390 --> 06:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
the comment earlier from the police
 
06:50:05.270 --> 06:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
chief who wants to be able to go in and
 
06:50:07.070 --> 06:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
do random inspections and check out
 
06:50:09.830 --> 06:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
people's homes well I can't think of any
 
06:50:13.490 --> 06:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
other situation in life where you need
 
06:50:15.948 --> 06:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
to disclose your medical information to
 
06:50:18.468 --> 06:50:18.478 align:start position:0%
a police officer and allow them to come
 
06:50:20.868 --> 06:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
in and search your home nobody does that
 
06:50:22.910 --> 06:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
for diabetes to make sure that you're
 
06:50:25.850 --> 06:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
using your needles for insulin and not
 
06:50:28.250 --> 06:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
you know for something else no nobody
 
06:50:31.190 --> 06:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
does that for anything I I feel that
 
06:50:33.770 --> 06:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
this is that would be the Chief's Way
 
06:50:37.190 --> 06:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
and the police their way of overstepping
 
06:50:39.948 --> 06:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
their boundaries and trying to control a
 
06:50:41.810 --> 06:50:41.820 align:start position:0%
program that they have no business
 
06:50:45.048 --> 06:50:45.058 align:start position:0%
trying to control I have complete and
 
06:50:46.968 --> 06:50:46.978 align:start position:0%
utter faith in Health and Human Services
 
06:50:49.968 --> 06:50:49.978 align:start position:0%
to be able to control this program and
 
06:50:52.430 --> 06:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
monitor this program so that it would be
 
06:50:56.390 --> 06:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
effective for any and all patient that
 
06:50:58.850 --> 06:50:58.860 align:start position:0%
chose to participate with the home grow
 
06:51:01.850 --> 06:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
version of this do I think this will
 
06:51:04.788 --> 06:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
impact the dispensaries negatively no I
 
06:51:07.190 --> 06:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
do not because for the few of us that
 
06:51:08.868 --> 06:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
want to take on the challenge of
 
06:51:12.048 --> 06:51:12.058 align:start position:0%
attempting to grow at home there are
 
06:51:14.990 --> 06:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands more that will
 
06:51:18.110 --> 06:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
still maintain using the dispensaries as
 
06:51:20.990 --> 06:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
they always have been
 
06:51:23.868 --> 06:51:23.878 align:start position:0%
and I really appreciate you giving me
 
06:51:26.750 --> 06:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to talk
 
06:51:30.410 --> 06:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
um I also have a lot of background in
 
06:51:32.330 --> 06:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
just about every single aspect of
 
06:51:35.750 --> 06:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis there is from my past and I
 
06:51:39.110 --> 06:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
would be more than welcome to answer any
 
06:51:41.090 --> 06:51:41.100 align:start position:0%
and all questions and leave you with
 
06:51:43.490 --> 06:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
this thought by not
 
06:51:46.190 --> 06:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
providing and passing medical homework
 
06:51:48.530 --> 06:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
home grow and by keeping the
 
06:51:51.368 --> 06:51:51.378 align:start position:0%
restrictions so difficult on a patient
 
06:51:54.830 --> 06:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
you are in essence helping to continue
 
06:51:58.128 --> 06:51:58.138 align:start position:0%
pushing patients to potentially Black
 
06:52:01.310 --> 06:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
Market sources where they may not be
 
06:52:04.368 --> 06:52:04.378 align:start position:0%
able to acquire safe and natural product
 
06:52:06.830 --> 06:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
for themselves
 
06:52:09.770 --> 06:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony we

the chair recognizes Josie Pinto uh good
 
06:52:43.968 --> 06:52:43.978 align:start position:0%
afternoon all my name is Josie I'm here
 
06:52:45.530 --> 06:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
as a lobbyist for New Hampshire youth
 
06:52:47.510 --> 06:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
movement and I'm in full support of HB
 
06:52:47.520 --> 06:52:49.190 align:start position:0%
movement and I'm in full support of HB
350.

06:52:49.190 --> 06:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
350.
 
06:52:50.930 --> 06:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
um so last week the criminal justice
 
06:52:52.670 --> 06:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
committee voted to retain two bills that
 
06:52:54.410 --> 06:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
would have expanded cannabis use in our
 
06:52:56.750 --> 06:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
state allowing voices of out-of-state
 
06:52:58.490 --> 06:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
people to outweigh the massive support
 
06:53:01.448 --> 06:53:01.458 align:start position:0%
from people within New Hampshire with
 
06:53:05.628 --> 06:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
963 people signing in to support HB 237
 
06:53:05.638 --> 06:53:06.610 align:start position:0%
963 people signing in to support HB 237
and

06:53:06.610 --> 06:53:06.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:53:11.208 --> 06:53:11.218 align:start position:0%
1109 signing in to support HB 629 I want
 
06:53:13.310 --> 06:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
to urge this committee to listen to the
 
06:53:15.650 --> 06:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
clear opinion of people in our state and
 
06:53:18.890 --> 06:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
vote to pass HB 350. right now this bill
 
06:53:20.930 --> 06:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
is our last chance to do anything that
 
06:53:22.548 --> 06:53:22.558 align:start position:0%
would meaningfully make a difference in
 
06:53:24.830 --> 06:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
the lives of medical cannabis users
 
06:53:26.270 --> 06:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to keep it brief I know
 
06:53:28.430 --> 06:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
there's a big storm coming but uh being
 
06:53:30.650 --> 06:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
a medical cannabis patient is incredibly
 
06:53:32.810 --> 06:53:32.820 align:start position:0%
expensive not to mention that most
 
06:53:34.788 --> 06:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis patients are also paying for a
 
06:53:36.530 --> 06:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
whole other set of medications that they
 
06:53:38.570 --> 06:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
need we already have some of the highest
 
06:53:40.730 --> 06:53:40.740 align:start position:0%
national costs for health care if we
 
06:53:42.890 --> 06:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
knew it was safe and easy to make these
 
06:53:44.510 --> 06:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
other medications from herbs that grow
 
06:53:46.430 --> 06:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
naturally would we stop people from
 
06:53:48.650 --> 06:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
doing that millions of people use
 
06:53:50.390 --> 06:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
natural herbs to treat conditions every
 
06:53:52.128 --> 06:53:52.138 align:start position:0%
day and this is the case with cannabis
 
06:53:54.650 --> 06:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
it's a medicinal plant that's used used
 
06:53:56.570 --> 06:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
to grow naturally before we even made it
 
06:53:56.580 --> 06:53:57.590 align:start position:0%
to grow naturally before we even made it
illegal

06:53:57.590 --> 06:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
06:53:59.750 --> 06:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
I urge you and the live for your die
 
06:54:01.610 --> 06:54:01.620 align:start position:0%
State let's allow patients to make the
 
06:54:03.410 --> 06:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
decision themselves and allow this bill
 
06:54:05.868 --> 06:54:05.878 align:start position:0%
to pass today thank you so much
 
06:54:15.490 --> 06:54:15.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:19.610 --> 06:54:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:25.490 --> 06:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
closing now the hearing on house film350
 
06:54:27.650 --> 06:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
hello everybody
 
06:54:30.288 --> 06:54:30.298 align:start position:0%
be safe and we'll see you tomorrow
 
06:54:32.750 --> 06:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
remotely as Republicans I hope to see
 
06:54:36.850 --> 06:54:36.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:38.930 --> 06:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody
 
06:54:38.940 --> 06:54:44.390 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody
everyone

06:54:44.390 --> 06:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
