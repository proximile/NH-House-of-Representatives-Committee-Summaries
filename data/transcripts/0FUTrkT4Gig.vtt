00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
since there may be some people online
 
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll sort of start or tell you what
 
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
we're planning to do um which isn't much
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
so um the the reason we're here this
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
morning is to act on house Bill 436
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
which was the you know a major change to
 
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
the retirement plan of group two uh an
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
enhancement um for for certain um uh
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
certain members and uh that has been
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
delayed you know the house put put it
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
into House Bill 2 it um was taken out by
 
00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
the Senate so it's not in the final
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
version of the budget in any way and so
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
the bill but the bill itself was
 
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
retained by our committee and it's still
 
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
here and we're going to be executing it
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
later today in the big room so the
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
question is what are we going to do okay
 
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
so just slightly giving a little
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
background that we have to act on House
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
Bill 436 because it was retained and and
 
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
the original plan was to wait for the
 
00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
there was a commission dealing with this
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
issue um and to wait for their
 
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation and then use this bill as
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
a vehicle for that issue um but as I
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
understand it that's not ready and so we
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
so so good morning sorry I'm a little
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
late um
 
00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
so there's been a lot of uh perhaps
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
drama in the whole issue we were hoping
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
as Dan or representative Maguire said to
 
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
have something uh ready to present the
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh commission voted 8
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
to6 last Thursday to support a
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
plan however trying to get the uh LBA
 
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
and again not to throw anyone under the
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
bus because it was just way too short a
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
time to get things together together uh
 
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
the retirement system Marty's been great
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
trying to get some of the factual
 
00:11:07.949 --> 00:11:07.959 align:start position:0%
numbers the financial impact both on the
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
state and the municipalities together
 
00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
which uh obviously takes some time so
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
the plan going
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
forward is that uh and I have to give
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative eil some credit for
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
putting this bug in my ear yesterday um
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
I was thinking that we could go to the
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
rules committee once we get everything
 
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
done for a late introduction of a a bill
 
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
to address what 436 did and some other
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
additions that the U retirement
 
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.110 align:start position:0%
additions that the U retirement
commission

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
suggested and Karen said well gee I
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
think the rules committee I'm sorry
 
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.949 align:start position:0%
think the rules committee I'm sorry
representative

00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
evil said the rules committee some time
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
ago said if a commission and I'm sure
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
all of you already know this anyway but
 
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
I had forgotten but if a commission
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
makes a recommendation you can file a
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
late introduction so that's what we're
 
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
going going to do going to get all the
 
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
facts together allow the retirement
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
system and the LBA and Os to get
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
everything lined up as I think all of
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
you sitting out here know that the
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
division takes a lot of pride in their
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
work we want all the numbers we're not
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
going to just push something forward
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
without the facts especially the
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
financial facts which we'll have in a
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
weeks uh in the meantime I guess we'll
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
act on the bill before us uh we can
 
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
either retain it not retain but interim
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
study or itl it I know Dan had had some
 
00:12:42.189 --> 00:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
amendments that he would had talked
 
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
about at one point if we brought this
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
forward but again the process going
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
forward uh somebody will introduce the
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
new legislation um I there'll be a
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
hearing a public hearing it'll go to
 
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
Edna first they'll have a at least one
 
00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:03.079 align:start position:0%
or two public hearings on it then if it
 
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
is successful getting out of there on
 
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
the floor of the house it will come here
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
there'll be an expedited process at
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
least in the house we'll try to push it
 
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
forward the speaker wants everyone to
 
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
know he's completely behind getting this
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
issue behind us once and for all and
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
supports what we're suggesting here and
 
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
at that unless representa maggu has
 
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
something else to add or anybody else
 
00:13:28.509 --> 00:13:28.519 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman so first
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
of all I'd like to uh just say that the
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
what the retirement commission ended up
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
doing as as I understand it has two
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
particular features one is that it's
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
just a change of the multiplier from two
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
to 2 and a
 
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
half% um and that it applies to all
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
group two current employees not just
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
this particular group and it just
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
happens that that's exactly what I was
 
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
arguing for or six months ago when I got
 
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
shouted down
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
so um so I'm in favor of
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
it and um but uh the one thing that's
 
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
that's so the choices for House Bill 436
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
are simply itl and wait for this bill um
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
but we we do have a prepared Amendment
 
00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
which if you remember house bill 50 was
 
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
the bill that I convinced you to um to
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
pay down the unfunded liability with $50
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
million right and that would um that
 
00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:39.079 align:start position:0%
would get us a little bit less in debt a
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
little quicker um and it the also
 
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
consequence of that would be um
 
00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:46.759 align:start position:0%
employers would pay a little bit less
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
towards the unfunded liability in the
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
future and so we that that we passed as
 
00:14:58.269 --> 00:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
the house very fairly strongly we tabled
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
it and we put it in House Bill two and
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
the Senate ripped it out so um so we
 
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
have an amendment today if we wanted to
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
you know bring up that issue again and
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
push it forward we could make House Bill
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
436 into house bill 50 and and send it
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
forward that way it's it's just a
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
possibility I I don't know that it's
 
00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:27.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
anyway so would you like to offer that
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
amendment I assuming uh Melissa has it
 
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
yes represent cells yes thank you Mr
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
chair just a point of clarification um
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
if if they proceed with the plan that
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
you discussed it would be a totally new
 
00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
bill and 436 has nothing to do with it
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:57.430 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
present Maguire
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
so I want to point out that um this 50
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
million is slightly different than um if
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
in the bill we've been talking about the
 
00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:15.559 align:start position:0%
one for group two you simply raised the
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
amount by 50 million right because
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
because the retirement system separately
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
tracks the unfunded liability for the
 
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
different categories right there's an
 
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability for teachers and for
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
other employees and for police and for
 
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
fire as I understand it and so um this
 
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
is 50 million across the board sort of
 
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
for everyone but but in the bill we've
 
00:17:44.909 --> 00:17:44.919 align:start position:0%
been talking about which is strictly for
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
group two that if we added 50 million to
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
that it would strictly change the
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability for police and fire
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
right so it's there's a slight
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
difference I mean it's it's
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
probably somewhat inconsequential in
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
that you know most
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
well not exactly right because this
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
would change the rates a little bit for
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
schools for example and that wouldn't
 
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
right so um but in any case I guess I
 
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
will offer this I I'm in favor of it I
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
think we have the money sitting around
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
in the education trust fund doing
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
nothing and
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
so um so I I would like to pass this
 
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
is there a second to representative
 
00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:35.559 align:start position:0%
Maguire's amendment number
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
it discussion on the
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
amendment represent cells anything yes
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so basically
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
um it's a fiscally responsible thing to
 
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
do probably right to we have the money
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's Surplus money we'd be using
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
and we'd be bringing down the liability
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
which in in turn would lower the rates
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
going forward it uh it would help us to
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
take get reduce our debt in the state
 
00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:12.919 align:start position:0%
could I respond sure thank you yes
 
00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
so the way it works is if you put in a
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
dollar into the unfunded liability today
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
you don't have to put in a do
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
6.75 next year right and and A113 the
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
year after and so on right and um and so
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
it's effectively paying down a debt that
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
is accumulating at
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
6.75% and that as I understand it is the
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
highest rate of debt of any of our you
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
know it's more than State bonds and so
 
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
on so to me getting
 
00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
do and um if we do end up going with the
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
other plan with the commission this all
 
00:20:03.149 --> 00:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
goes away it it would not or would this
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
amendment go on to you said uh house
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
bill 50 it
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
would so this would be a completely this
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
is not this would be a separate bill
 
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
it's basically saying to the Senate we
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
want to re we want to you know you took
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
this out of the budget we didn't have a
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
committee of conference this is
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
something we want to argue for right but
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's separate from the other
 
00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:30.039 align:start position:0%
thing yeah
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
 
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
Maguire Marty would you like to comment
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
at all I KN you traveled all the way
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
something thanks Mr chair I was hoping
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
to blend into the wallpaper today but um
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
didn't think that was likely um just
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
just the only comment is I just looked
 
00:21:01.149 --> 00:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
on my phone at the fiscal note for the
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
house version of hp50 and saw that
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's where you would look for
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note to see the rate
 
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
reduction I think it's between
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
0.9% of pay for employees up to 0.21% of
 
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
pay for um fire and then the range in
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
between so so basically it would it
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
would reduce the unfunded portion of the
 
00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:24.919 align:start position:0%
employer contribution rates not just in
 
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
the next rate cycle but going forward
 
00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:29.559 align:start position:0%
and you know and so it this would be
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
akin to you know if you had uh you know
 
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
a significant credit card debt and you
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
put extra money on next month it's just
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
less that you're going to be paying an
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
interest over over time so again we
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
would not have any position on this bill
 
00:21:46.269 --> 00:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
is from you know it's a policy decision
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
for the legislature and a fiscal
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
decision but just want to come up and
 
00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:51.559 align:start position:0%
say all
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
that thanks Marty any questions for
 
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further questions uh
 
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
I will comment that I will support
 
00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:05.799 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire's
 
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh I think a lot of work was
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
done back uh prior to the budget it made
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense I think Marty's comments
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
add to that makes a lot of sense and
 
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
along with what representative McGuire's
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
already stated and when the clerk is
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
ready we'll have a
 
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
vote where everybody is today but make
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
okay uh this is a vote on Amendment 2023
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
2458 offered by representative Maguire
 
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
and seconded by rep chair leean um so um
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire
 
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:22:55.149 --> 00:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
camell yes representative huitt
 
00:22:55.159 --> 00:22:56.950 align:start position:0%
camell yes representative huitt
yes

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.190 align:start position:0%
yes
um

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm just going to comment I in
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
light of everything that we have ahead
 
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
of us with respect to the retirement uh
 
00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
funding um I will be respectfully voting
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
nay and it's not because I think paying
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
down the unfunded liability is a bad
 
00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
idea um thank you so the clerk votes nay
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
so the is that every oh chair
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
leean yes okay so it's 4 to
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
one um and the amendment to uh HB 436
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
passes I move to pass with am okay I'll
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
move I'll move to pass with
 
00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I'll
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
second okay probably no need for an
 
00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:51.799 align:start position:0%
additional vote just okay um although I
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
was in favor say no okay
 
00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:56.310 align:start position:0%
was in favor say no okay
I

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
okay the vote being 4 to1 the Maguire
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment passes and will be taken up by
 
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
the full committee at 10
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:14.919 align:start position:0%
abely so I I sent Marty a few questions
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
about what the retirement commission did
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
um I should say Mr Carlo and
 
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
um a and so I wanted to to sort of
 
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
clarify um when you say he he responded
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
that so the the way the retirement
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
commission apparently wrote their bill
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
was that it was giving 50 million now um
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
but that there would be some cost to to
 
00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities and others uh later on
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
well if is that right if I could be for
 
00:24:53.549 --> 00:24:53.559 align:start position:0%
Marty response they actually didn't
 
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
write anything they had a concept that
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
they voted on yeah
 
00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:00.039 align:start position:0%
so that's what made it a little more
 
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
difficult there was never any written
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
language it was like what this might do
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
the possible impact financially on
 
00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:10.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities on the state but there
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
was never any draft I got it okay and
 
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
since the commission has not written
 
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:16.919 align:start position:0%
their final report there's nothing
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
really go on there so it was a vote on
 
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
the concept and that's what's made it a
 
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.789 align:start position:0%
the concept and that's what's made it a
little

00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
little
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
more difficult to get our hands around
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
it so Marty presented to us
 
00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
um different concepts that had been
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
batted back and forth and there were
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
some numbers that they were fairly
 
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the retirement but
 
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
nothing had really been firmed up I see
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
so but here's my question so when I
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
asked about that he said to me that um
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
if you put in 56 million
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
now then that pays for the change in
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability for this increase in
 
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
benefit but it doesn't pay for the
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
normal cost of the increase in benefit
 
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
in the future and what I wanted to make
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
sure is that I understand what that
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
means all right so is
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
the if you put in 56 million now that
 
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.029 align:start position:0%
the if you put in 56 million now that
pays

00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
pays
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
for um all of today's employees anybody
 
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
who's now working and how much they're
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
retirement is expected to be but it
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay for the guy hired next year
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
and who's getting a better benefit than
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
he would otherwise is that right yes um
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
just just to kind of build out on the on
 
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:37.640 align:start position:0%
the yes a little bit so so there there
 
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
are two pieces to um you know that go
 
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
well besides the medical subsidy there's
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
two pension pieces that go into funding
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability which is being
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
paid off over a period of time and the
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
normal cost that representative Maguire
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
referred to and that's the cost of
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
benefits as they're acred that's what
 
00:26:57.669 --> 00:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
the actuary says based on all the
 
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the statute um the
 
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
employer needs to put in x amount
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
percent of my pay to fund my benefit
 
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
when I retire or some Melissa's benefit
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
or or another any Public Employee so so
 
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
that's the normal cost um this proposal
 
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
by the uh commission and and the
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
commission by mutual agreement of the
 
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
Senate President and the speaker who
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
were both on the commission agreed to uh
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
authorize funding for us to reach out to
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
our actuary to sort of
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
um cost out some of these Concepts so um
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
th this particular proposal because it
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
affects um current and future group two
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
members so people who haven't been hired
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
yet but you know will be hired you know
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
tomorrow or 10 years from now you could
 
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.750 align:start position:0%
tomorrow or 10 years from now you could
you

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
can't accurately capture the full
 
00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:50.360 align:start position:0%
funding of that because you don't know
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
what inflation and demographics and
 
00:27:53.509 --> 00:27:53.519 align:start position:0%
everything else are going to be in the
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
2030s and 2040s so the 55.9 million was
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability portion of this
 
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
change that's basically the backfill you
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
know anybody who's affected by this
 
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
their multiplier in some cases is
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
retroactively larger if they had more
 
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
than 10 years based on you know when
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
they hit their anniversary so this
 
00:28:15.789 --> 00:28:15.799 align:start position:0%
there's the um there's that liability
 
00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
piece and what would if the um ultimate
 
00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:22.039 align:start position:0%
legislative proposal funds that unfunded
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
piece there is a normal cost piece
 
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
associated with the future ongoing cost
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
of of this change you know for for
 
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
members you know current members and
 
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
members as they're hired in the future
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
um I I think one of your questions uh
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire was you know if
 
00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
you paid more than 55 million could you
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
offset some of the future costs and the
 
00:28:47.389 --> 00:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
answer is yes I'm not sure if an actuary
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
could say if you give us 65 it'll even
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
it out for the first five I don't you
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
know but it's like it's the same
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
Principle as your house bill 50
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment though it's like if you the
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
more you put on the unfunded it's just
 
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
less interest on your credit card you're
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
paying later May so spec let's talk
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
about a specific example which would
 
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
help me um suppose there's an employee
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
who's currently working has 15 years in
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
yeah and will retire 10 years from now
 
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so so there's an extra benefit
 
00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
for the 15 years already but there will
 
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
also be an EXT benefit for the coming 10
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
years right so does the 56 million pay
 
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
for all of that for this particular
 
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
employee or is the next 10 years
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
part part of the normal cost that's not
 
00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
being paid by the that's all the the
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
backfilling you know so if you had so 15
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
15E employee just so they would have
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
started in 2008 so they would have hit
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
their 10th anniversary in
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
2018 um I think they would be in the 49
 
00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
and 24 with a 2.1% multiplier depending
 
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
on on their higher date but they would
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
they had less than four years as of one
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
one of 12 so you know basically they've
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
been acre a multiplier and that's been
 
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
part of the the rates that of 2.1% a
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
year for every year work so you know
 
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
they they under the commission proposal
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
they acrew that multiplier for the first
 
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
10 years so that's 21% of their AFC
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately when they retire but
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
beginning on their 10th anniversary
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
which is in this case is 2018 you know
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
the multiplier is 2.5 going forward so
 
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's 5 years for that individual where
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
instead of a 2.1 multiplier which we
 
00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:40.519 align:start position:0%
were funding towards it's two and a half
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
so it's it's like 2% more in the pension
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
you know type of thing and that's the
 
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
the backfilling part of the unfunded
 
00:30:50.669 --> 00:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
obviously the farther back you go the
 
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded is more associated with the
 
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
folks who have more service now because
 
00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
they you you're crewing it and and you
 
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
know for somebody who was hired
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday there isn't really any
 
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
unfunded associated with that person
 
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
it's just a going forward cost although
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
you know these are all Blended together
 
00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:08.519 align:start position:0%
so there's no disproportionate separate
 
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
rates for different people based on you
 
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
know when they started but you know that
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's how it works so that 20
 
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
that 15year person they worked another
 
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
to work up to 25 years say so the 15
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
years um 2.1 time 15 is
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
31.5 I think you know that's what the
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
current multiplier would have generated
 
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
at two and a half that's
 
00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.549 align:start position:0%
at two and a half that's
25

00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
25
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
37.5 so you know it you know it would
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
increase the ultimate the percentage of
 
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
their average final compensation you
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
know that they retire with and that
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
increases the the lifetime benefit so
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
that that's in a nutshell
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
right I I I am in the middle of working
 
00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
on some handouts if if I would have
 
00:31:58.029 --> 00:31:58.039 align:start position:0%
rushed over here if this was going to go
 
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
out today but it gives us more time to
 
00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
them so very quickly for representative
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
Sweeney and grassy um as far as 436 when
 
00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:12.039 align:start position:0%
the commission recommendations we're
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
going to hold off we're going to
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
expedite a bill but a separate bill to
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
deal with the commission's
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations allowing retirement the
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
LBA and Os to come up with good verbiage
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
good fiscal notes because it was just a
 
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
little rushed and um
 
00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
knowing that you two are both absent
 
00:32:32.669 --> 00:32:32.679 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire pushed forward an
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to add 50 million doll back
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
house bill 50 uh that we passed here and
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
that was passed by the division 4 to1 so
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
that's you will get a chance to vote on
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
it and yeah 10 o' and I know that both
 
00:32:51.149 --> 00:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
parties have caucuses at 9:30 or
 
00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
whatever so which is now so we're all
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
good hey
 
00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:59.909 align:start position:0%
good hey
Jerry

00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:59.919 --> 00:33:02.990 align:start position:0%
 
all

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.549 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
no all right Maguire hey hey Dan I've
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
got a I just got this night uh this is
 
00:33:22.629 --> 00:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
