relative to licensure and Mental Health
 
00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 align:start position:0%

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
um this bill House Bill 428 was
 
00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 align:start position:0%
requested by and written with the
 
00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 align:start position:0%
collaboration of the board
 
00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 align:start position:0%
of Health mental health practice and
 
00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just looking behind me to see
 
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
if there's anyone from oplc and I don't
 
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
see anybody I recognize
 
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.670 align:start position:0%
okay good
so

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
as you will hear in more detail from
 
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
others who will testify after me this
 
00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 align:start position:0%
bill does three things
 
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
it deals with conditional licenses which
 
00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
to tell you the truth I didn't know
 
00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
existed until I was on this committee
 
00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.750 align:start position:0%
existed until I was on this committee
um

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
conditional licenses within the board of
 
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
similar to initial licenses that other
 
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 align:start position:0%
states have like Maine and Massachusetts
 
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire never had so for
 
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.729 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire never had so for
example

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 align:start position:0%
somebody goes to school for a masters of
 
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
social work
 
00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
they come out of school with an MSW
 
00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.250 align:start position:0%
they come out of school with an MSW
degree

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 align:start position:0%
degree
 
00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 align:start position:0%
they get a job at a local Community
 
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Center they're supervised
 
00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 align:start position:0%
by a more experienced clinician
 
00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.350 align:start position:0%
by a more experienced clinician
um

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
prior to conditional licenses that
 
00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 align:start position:0%
person was not licensed at all even
 
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
though they were providing services to
 
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
people under somebody else's name
 
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.050 align:start position:0%
people under somebody else's name
um

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.790 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
in 19 in 2021 a a law was signed into
 
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
statute this is already done this is not
 
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
what this bill does to create
 
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
conditional licenses within the
 
00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 align:start position:0%
Board of mental health practice so it
 
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
creates conditional licenses for
 
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
social workers ba level social workers
 
00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 align:start position:0%
associate level social workers
 
00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
and also marriage and family counselors
 
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
so you may be asking since they already
 
00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 align:start position:0%
created conditional licenses and it's
 
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
already in statute why this bill
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
this bill does three things
 
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
number one it requires oplc to set fees
 
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
for this these conditional licenses
 
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
second it clarifies the statute that was
 
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
signed into law in 2021 which creates
 
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
conditional licenses
 
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
in RSA 330a it adds the relevant
 
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
language under licensed independent
 
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Counselors and marriage
 
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 align:start position:0%
and family therapists evidently when
 
00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 align:start position:0%
they first put this in law
 
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
they listed all the different
 
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
professions under social work so this is
 
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 align:start position:0%
really just a change not in the language
 
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
but where the language goes in the bill
 
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.090 align:start position:0%
but where the language goes in the bill
um

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
the third thing that this does is that
 
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
it makes it
 
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
clear that those with conditional
 
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
licenses are subject to this
 
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
that is a really important piece because
 
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.990 align:start position:0%
that is a really important piece because
um

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
prior to conditional licenses
 
00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 align:start position:0%
conditional licenses now exist but they
 
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
haven't been implemented they're still
 
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
in the rules process
 
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
so prior to having these conditional
 
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.070 align:start position:0%
so prior to having these conditional
licenses

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 align:start position:0%
I might be right out of Social Work
 
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
school and providing services to people
 
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
with my services being billed to a
 
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.370 align:start position:0%
with my services being billed to a
supervisor

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 align:start position:0%
supervisor
 
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
but nobody has jurisdiction over me in
 
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
terms of consumer protection if I um if
 
00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 align:start position:0%
there's an ethical issue if there's an
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
issue of competence there's no place to
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
take this too this will clarify that
 
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
people these people with conditional
 
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
licenses are practicing under the
 
00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the board of Mental
 
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.810 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the board of Mental
Health

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
I think that's really all I hate to say
 
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
it's a housekeeping bill because people
 
00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
have said that in the past and here and
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
live to regret it but I think it's a
 
00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.290 align:start position:0%
live to regret it but I think it's a
pretty

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.730 align:start position:0%
pretty
um

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
simple bill that does not do much but it
 
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
puts things in their rightful place and
 
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
I think hopefully this will expedite
 
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
um rules being approved so that this can
 
00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 align:start position:0%
actually go into effect
 
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
thank you representative questions uh
 
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
yes representative Koval
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
taking my question so does this expand
 
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
the uh the potentially expand the
 
00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 align:start position:0%
workforce the number of applicants
 
00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 align:start position:0%
available to school districts for
 
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
example which are having difficulty
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
hiring and retaining people
 
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
does does it does it
 
00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
add to the the number of of people
 
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
available for these positions
 
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
I would say
 
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
um not really this just clarifies
 
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
something that's already in law I would
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
say that part of the
 
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
part of the um
 
00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:19.979 align:start position:0%
intent of creating various various
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
levels of licensure
 
00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:25.139 align:start position:0%
um an associate's level social worker a
 
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
ba level social worker and as well as a
 
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
master's level social worker part of the
 
00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:32.699 align:start position:0%
intent going back was to kind of have a
 
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
pipeline into the profession which would
 
00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:37.099 align:start position:0%
incur encourage people to go on and get
 
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
further educated and um
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
become higher level clinicians so I
 
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
think if you go back and think of the
 
00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:49.259 align:start position:0%
whole Gestalt of this Bill yes but this
 
00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
bill really
 
00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
um this will not change the numbers it
 
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
will just clarify how this is all done
 
00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
um so some of you have been on the
 
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:01.969 align:start position:0%
um so some of you have been on the
committee

00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:01.979 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:05.180 align:start position:0%
last year know that I've been trying to
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
reinstate my clinical mental health
 
00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:10.919 align:start position:0%
counselor license which I let drop in
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
2015 and I've been jumping through many
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
Hoops with the board and um
 
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
if this bill was passed could they have
 
00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
granted me a a conditional license two
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
and a half years ago when I started this
 
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
process so that I might have been
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:35.459 align:start position:0%
I will defer that to somebody else that
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
would be the case if you were right out
 
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
of school I'm not sure since you are
 
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
were licensed and then not licensed and
 
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
want to be licensed again that might be
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
a different
 
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.610 align:start position:0%
a different
um

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
that might be a different scenario yeah
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
can I see another hand up uh a moment
 
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
ago yes Dr Nagel representative Nagel
 
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for my
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
question I just have a question about
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph
 
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
um one where it crosses our board and
 
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
puts office of um
 
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
why is that change made
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
that is a good question and I'm going to
 
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
defer to the person who's here from
 
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
Office of professional life insurance
 
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.889 align:start position:0%

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that is now consistent
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
with other boards or if that is a
 
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
um a change just with this board in
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.540 align:start position:0%

clerk yes or if you want to summarize
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
you can just give them your written copy
 
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
too sure I can do that so
 
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.569 align:start position:0%
too sure I can do that so
um

00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:02.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
HP 428 has been proposed to clarify an
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
add-on amendment to HB 143 which took
 
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
effect in October 2021
 
00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
that bill created conditional licenses
 
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
for clinical social workers
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
clinical Mental Health Counselors and
 
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
marriage and family therapists
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the bill was added to
 
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
three RSA 330a 18 which is the section
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
of RSA 330 that describes the various
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
requirements for licensure as a social
 
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.449 align:start position:0%
requirements for licensure as a social
worker

00:12:35.449 --> 00:12:35.459 align:start position:0%
worker
 
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
the conditional license section was was
 
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
added as RSA 330a 18d Social Work
 
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
conditional license
 
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
the problem with the legislation in HP
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
143 was that section e of RSA 330a 8 18d
 
00:12:56.569 --> 00:12:56.579 align:start position:0%
describes the requirements for
 
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
conditional licensure as a clinical
 
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
mental health counselor and section F
 
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
describes the requirements for
 
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
conditional licensure as a marriage and
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
family therapist as noted above the
 
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:12.500 align:start position:0%
title of RSA 330a 18 is social work
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
conditional license
 
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:16.700 align:start position:0%
the board of mental health practice
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
which Dr Goodnow was member of from 2016
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
through 2022 endorses House Bill 428
 
00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959 align:start position:0%
because it rectifies the misplacement of
 
00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:29.030 align:start position:0%
because it rectifies the misplacement of
enf

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
enf
 
00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
and moves them to where they logically
 
00:13:30.899 --> 00:13:32.710 align:start position:0%
and moves them to where they logically
belong

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
belong
 
00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
hb428 moves section e to RSA 330a19
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
which details the requirements for
 
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
clinical Mental Health Counselors
 
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
and moves F to RSA 330a 21 which details
 
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
the requirements for marriage and family
 
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.050 align:start position:0%
the requirements for marriage and family
therapists

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
therapists
 
00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
this legislation if passed will smooth
 
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
the ability of the board of mental
 
00:13:58.009 --> 00:13:58.019 align:start position:0%
health practice to write logical
 
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.329 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
together

00:14:01.329 --> 00:14:01.339 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
hb428 and the rules revision revisions
 
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
to follow will make it easier for
 
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
applicants and the public to follow the
 
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.550 align:start position:0%
applicants and the public to follow the
law

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
it was a little bit dry his testimony
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
but that's the logic behind this
 
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
I can take questions now if you'd want
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:31.129 --> 00:14:31.139 align:start position:0%
and if you know is is the reason that
 
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:34.700 align:start position:0%
we've gone from board to oplsc because
 
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:38.060 align:start position:0%
there there have been a series of
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
reorganizations and various pieces of
 
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
the administrative work have been
 
00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
transferred from boards to the oplc over
 
00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
the years and it's now conforming the
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
statute to the current practice
 
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
correct under
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's under 330 or 310 a
 
00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.430 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's under 330 or 310 a
1

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
1
 
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
a and I'm not sure of that exact statute
 
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
reference the oplc now has authority
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
over all fee
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
um setting and so fees now fall under
 
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
the oplc
 
00:15:17.689 --> 00:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
as part of a regulatory scheme
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
I see none
 
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:27.540 align:start position:0%

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.689 --> 00:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else here to testify on
 
00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:38.300 align:start position:0%
House Bill 428
 
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:40.500 align:start position:0%

I would like to point out that after
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
discussion with various committee
 
00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:55.740 align:start position:0%

00:28:57.049 --> 00:28:57.059 align:start position:0%
following bills
 
00:28:59.450 --> 00:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
House Bill 587

I'll spill 598.
 
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 264.
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 574
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
House Bill 282 and House Bill 397 and
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
these will be noticed in the calendar
 
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
and we do so so that anyone who is his
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
explicitly for those bills uh you know
 
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
may make other arrangements on the
 
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:28.740 align:start position:0%
schedule yes Mr chairman point of order
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
yes so the other ones that you do not
 
00:29:32.769 --> 00:29:32.779 align:start position:0%
list are not going to be exact today
 
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:34.980 align:start position:0%
those are the ones that are if you
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
listed the ones that are not those are
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
going to be continued represented
 
00:29:39.889 --> 00:29:39.899 align:start position:0%
continued yes so the others will be
 
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
addressed today okay
 
00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
yes representative Nagel
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm sorry get my glasses on
 
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry sorry it wasn't a quick enough
 
00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
study to tick off the ones we're not
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
exacting today would you be so kind as
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 587
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
oh it's Bill 598
 
00:30:09.409 --> 00:30:09.419 align:start position:0%
house bill 264.
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
House Bill 574
 
00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
House Bill 282
 
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else need me to repeat or
 
00:30:27.889 --> 00:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.409 --> 00:30:30.419 align:start position:0%
yes representative Weber
 
00:30:33.169 --> 00:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
really question of procedure I
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
understand there are issues with those
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
bills in a normal in a more normal year
 
00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
uh we would have subcommittees on those
 
00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
bills and I'm hoping that
 
00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299 align:start position:0%
uh in established in proportion roughly
 
00:30:51.409 --> 00:30:51.419 align:start position:0%
to our committee makeup if there are
 
00:30:53.529 --> 00:30:53.539 align:start position:0%
concerns with those bills I hope that
 
00:30:57.169 --> 00:30:57.179 align:start position:0%
that a small number of us might
 
00:30:59.210 --> 00:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
be able to work together on whatever
 
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
needs to happen on them just so that
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a blind side when we come back
 
00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:06.059 align:start position:0%
because a lot of those bills didn't have
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
any problems as of the end of business
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
they always welcome input uh all those
 
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
early bills representative Leon
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
um yes these the bills that were noticed
 
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
today were all of the early bills that
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
had been heard prior to today so that
 
00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
they were available should the committee
 
00:31:24.169 --> 00:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
be ready to have an executive session
 
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
because we weren't sure heading into the
 
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
hearings yesterday what would be
 
00:31:30.649 --> 00:31:30.659 align:start position:0%
available to us and unlike last year we
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
can't notice for any bills that have
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
been heard maybe available in executive
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
session so it's a matter of figuring out
 
00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
exactly how these are noticed
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately to make sure the committee
 
00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:40.980 align:start position:0%
can do our business while also not
 
00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
rushing anything that that needs to
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
maybe be heard next week we've noticed
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
executive sessions for both Wednesday
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
and Thursday afternoons so we will have
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
adequate time to discuss them further
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant if I could
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative Weber's
 
00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.269 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative Weber's
comment

00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
on these bills that we're going to pass
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
on today
 
00:32:06.289 --> 00:32:06.299 align:start position:0%
to help the committee going forward
 
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
is there any thought of what you thought
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
is Mr chairman about having a small
 
00:32:12.769 --> 00:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
group of us get together
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
to brainstorm the pros and cons of the
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
bill so we can go back with some sort of
 
00:32:21.409 --> 00:32:21.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
correct you're talking about the six
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
bills we've decided to continue at least
 
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
ask them at correct an ad hoc committee
 
00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
at least so we can at least have some
 
00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
discussion about the pros and cons of
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
the bill versus the subcommittee itself
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
representative I mean representative
 
00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
land did you have a comment on that uh
 
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
thank you I I think this was more of a
 
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
scheduling issue as opposed to there
 
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
being large issues around them we heard
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
these bills yesterday so some of them we
 
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
just need to we just need a little bit
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
more time for everybody to read through
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
them before before we're able to see if
 
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
it's time to have an executive session
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
and um I'm not I think it might be a
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
little premature to pull together a
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh perhaps we might
 
00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
consider that Wednesday when we meet
 
00:33:00.899 --> 00:33:02.870 align:start position:0%
consider that Wednesday when we meet
again

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
the issue with the subcommittee is these
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
are first committee bills and a
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee once appointed has to be
 
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
noticed in the calendar before it can
 
00:33:12.529 --> 00:33:12.539 align:start position:0%
meet we did
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
for the last two years have some very
 
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
informal groups that were less than a
 
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
quorum made up of people who were
 
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
interested in a particular Bill who just
 
00:33:27.529 --> 00:33:27.539 align:start position:0%
got together informally and talked about
 
00:33:29.889 --> 00:33:29.899 align:start position:0%
the bills because
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
they had a mutual interest and it was
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
not formal it was not directed by
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
anybody it was just a clump of people
 
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
that came together but we can't talk
 
00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
about our concerns here now unless we
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
open we could if we have actually opened
 
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
an executive session and then recessed
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
it again but I don't think anybody wants
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
to do that and we don't have time to do
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
an actual subcommittee because as soon
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
as the chair notices appoints a
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with official duties to
 
00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
recommend on a bill then that has to go
 
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
into the calendar and I don't think
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
we've got time to get it in the calendar
 
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
and get it done
 
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
going forward representative land on the
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
early one thank you for pointing out my
 
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
error and wording I met more of these ad
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
hoc groups to figure out next week as
 
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
we're meeting or as we can reach out to
 
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
each other as well if somebody has a
 
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
concern and they know that somebody else
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
is involved there's nothing prohibiting
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
less than a quorum discussing what the
 
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
issues may be that's how that's how we
 
00:34:36.649 --> 00:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
generally tend to arrive at decisions I
 
00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:42.419 align:start position:0%
representative Weber no I'm good okay
 
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
um so those bills being continued let us
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
proceed with the ones we still want to
 
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
consider those of you who are in session
 
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
um heard me announce that we will be
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
considering HP 47 today along with the
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
other bills that I noticed so let us
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
begin with HB 47 and I'd like to back up
 
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
oh as if we decided we're going to do
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
that oh okay my apologies
 
00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
um okay uh forget I said that
 
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
uh let's uh proceed to consideration of
 
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro do you want to
 
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:32.940 align:start position:0%

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:41.220 align:start position:0%

just heard it
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
so so we are able to consider it where
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
we just heard it and we're okay I'm
 
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
gonna execut immediately following the
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%

discussion

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380 align:start position:0%

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
I just think that it's a um Common Sense
 
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
bill that will clarify something that's
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's a policy that's already put in
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
been put in place and that we will be
 
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:29.690 align:start position:0%

practice and oplc move ahead with

conditional licenses which I think are
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
of value to the state especially in
 
00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.060 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman
 
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
looking at this because this is just a
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
very clear cleanup I was recently
 
00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
appointed to the Joint legislative
 
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
administrative rules committee and that
 
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
is one of the things that we are working
 
00:37:05.569 --> 00:37:05.579 align:start position:0%
on there is moving from fines being done
 
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
at the board level and being brought to
 
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:09.780 align:start position:0%

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%

requirements from social workers and
 
00:37:29.089 --> 00:37:29.099 align:start position:0%
mental health counselors in the right
 
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
places where they should be because
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
people might not think it's all the same
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
follow a specific protocol in
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
anticipation of Oregon donation that the
 
00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
billwood that's house or the document
 
00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:08.099 align:start position:0%
would have to subsequently be signed by
 
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
the physician of record into additional
 
00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.990 align:start position:0%
the physician of record into additional
nurses

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
nurses
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay yes
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
um we received the intent of a lot of
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
these bills is is Honorable
 
00:41:22.609 --> 00:41:22.619 align:start position:0%
um there is a problem with organ
 
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
donation and there's a variety of
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
strategies to try to improve that the
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
concern is that this bill
 
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
would actually do quite the opposite and
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
more concerning would put trauma
 
00:41:34.609 --> 00:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
patients at harm
 
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
um we received compelling testimony from
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
people that perform trauma Services
 
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:44.220 align:start position:0%
um that their primary responsibility is
 
00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:47.060 align:start position:0%
to save the life of the trauma patient
 
00:41:49.849 --> 00:41:49.859 align:start position:0%
we also learned and from my personal
 
00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
experience that the trauma team is
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
frequently quite variable when I
 
00:41:58.810 --> 00:41:58.820 align:start position:0%
performed trauma in Alaska it was me
 
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
it can also consist of a university
 
00:42:04.329 --> 00:42:04.339 align:start position:0%
setting of multiple individuals and
 
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:08.339 align:start position:0%
because of that trauma protocols can be
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
quite variable we also learned that
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
there is no such thing as a trauma
 
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
protocol that it's actually a set of
 
00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:18.260 align:start position:0%
guidelines unlike cardiac life support
 
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
trauma's uh it's a moving Target and
 
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
frequently you you can't follow a
 
00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:24.710 align:start position:0%
frequently you you can't follow a
specific

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
um guide you have to fly by the seat of
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
your pants frequently and by giving a
 
00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
group of individuals a recognized
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
protocol that they must follow and then
 
00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839 align:start position:0%
later document that they did follow that
 
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
protocol you start to put the risk of
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
that trauma patient the life of that
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
trauma patient at risk
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
indirectly that will affect the ability
 
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
of the um the organs to be available for
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
donation we also learned that trauma is
 
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
not a great source of donated organs
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
primarily because of the procedures that
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
have to be done and so on and so forth
 
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
so in the end the concern was that we
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
would be putting people's lives at risk
 
00:43:08.089 --> 00:43:08.099 align:start position:0%
the trauma docs also informed us number
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
one is that they wouldn't sign such a
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
form because they would not they
 
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
considered insulting that was the word
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
that several of them used they would not
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
put their name on such a document they
 
00:43:19.849 --> 00:43:19.859 align:start position:0%
also said that they didn't think that it
 
00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:23.099 align:start position:0%
was appropriate to have nurses who would
 
00:43:25.609 --> 00:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
be unqualified in these documents or
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
these protocols or guidelines would be
 
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:29.220 align:start position:0%
signing such a forms and we also heard
 
00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
from nursing groups that said the same
 
00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.990 align:start position:0%
from nursing groups that said the same
thing

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
other uh questions or discussion on this
 
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.109 align:start position:0%
other uh questions or discussion on this
motion

00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:43:41.809 --> 00:43:41.819 align:start position:0%
yes representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
chair I would also support
 
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.450 align:start position:0%
chair I would also support
um

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
an itl for this bill
 
00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.130 align:start position:0%
an itl for this bill
um

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:52.140 align:start position:0%
it seems to imply that in some cases
 
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
that people who are dealing with a
 
00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:56.339 align:start position:0%
serious trauma did not really try to
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
save the life of the patient because
 
00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
they're interested in the or more
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
interested in the organs than the life
 
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
of the patient
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
and not only do I personally find that
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
suspect but I don't think we should ever
 
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
be making
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
um laws based on one anecdote which
 
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
people seem to bring
 
00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:13.609 align:start position:0%
people seem to bring
um

00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
so I think it lacked any kind of data to
 
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
back up the reasoning for making such a
 
00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:20.270 align:start position:0%
back up the reasoning for making such a
law

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you

seeing none I'll ask Clark to call the
 
00:44:28.319 --> 00:44:31.550 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask Clark to call the

amendment 142h
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman I would like
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
to move amendment 142-h that was handed
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
out the other day in session I'm not
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
sure if everybody still has their copies
 
00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
this is the one where it clarify sorry I
 
00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:14.220 align:start position:0%
need a second before I speak I apologize
 
00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:18.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:26.089 --> 00:46:26.099 align:start position:0%
may I speak to that yes representative
 
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
thank you all proceed uh now uh so that
 
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
Amendment clarified the job titles and
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
the classifications within the uh within
 
00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
the bill because they had been
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
classified incorrectly in the original
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
drafting so this is uh one of those
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
cleanup amendments that hopefully um it
 
00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
still keeps with the same intent of the
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
bill and just clarifies that language
 
00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:52.140 align:start position:0%
and and for clarity Mr chair could I ask
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%

there may be some people in the room who
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
are here for the exact session on some
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%

including House Bill 587 and so I just
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%

who is who's here for that bill or some
 
00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:23.339 align:start position:0%
of the others that were continued that
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
is there any other discussion on this
 
00:48:27.359 --> 00:48:29.870 align:start position:0%
is there any other discussion on this
amendment

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
zero one four two eight it was blue
 
00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:35.210 align:start position:0%
zero one four two eight it was blue
what

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes um would you like me to read through
 
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
what's in this amendment so that
 
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
everybody knows so the first section to
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
amend the bill says it amends the what's
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
inserted in section two of the bill and
 
00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
it replaces paragraph three what that
 
00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:56.220 align:start position:0%
does is it changes the year from 2023 to
 
00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.849 align:start position:0%
does is it changes the year from 2023 to
2024.

00:48:58.849 --> 00:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
2024.
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
because implementation wise there's no
 
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
way that this would happen
 
00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:05.579 align:start position:0%
um by 2023 that was just a drafting
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
error left over from the prior version
 
00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
then the next section amends section
 
00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
three of the bill and what that does is
 
00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
it says that it does the classifications
 
00:49:17.569 --> 00:49:17.579 align:start position:0%
it says that the classification shall be
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
Information Technology manager 4 labor
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
grade 3 step 7. that's in section three
 
00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
and then in section four it also
 
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
restates those funding to Information
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
Technology manager four positions as
 
00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
required in paragraph three of this
 
00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:34.670 align:start position:0%
required in paragraph three of this
section

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:49:36.589 --> 00:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
so those were ones that had the wrong
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
labor grade and it was referring to a
 
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
prior year we all know it was a little
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
bit difficult and everybody was working
 
00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
really really hard to make sure that
 
00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:46.140 align:start position:0%
everything got out of Olsson there were
 
00:49:48.349 --> 00:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
a few things where we had where we had
 
00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
some small things that will be cleaned
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
up in amendments not just on this bill
 
00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure on plenty others this
 
00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.770 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure on plenty others this
session

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion on the
 
00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:59.630 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion on the
amendment

00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
representative I'm being told that
 
00:50:04.849 --> 00:50:04.859 align:start position:0%
there are people who didn't get the copy
 
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
of the amendment so
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
okay that would be helpful we'll get
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
some copies and
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
is this the amendment that was handed
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
out right by representative Edwards
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
right at the time that he was presenting
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
the bill went to OLS came right back and
 
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
then he was Distributing it okay I know
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
I have I'll be honest I don't have mine
 
00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
right in front of me either but I do
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
remember him walking around putting him
 
00:50:29.809 --> 00:50:29.819 align:start position:0%
in front of each of us
 
00:50:32.569 --> 00:50:32.579 align:start position:0%
yeah I believe
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of papers have been flying around
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%

as amended by Amendment
 
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
142h on House Bill 91.
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second to that motion
 
00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
second representative McLean seconds
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Palmer I'm sorry
 
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this bill
 
00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
establish is not about security it is
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
about privacy those are two separate
 
00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
issues and I believe there's a bill in
 
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
another committee that is dealing with a
 
00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
security apparatus within the state
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Health and
 
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
Human Services and more broadly in the
 
00:54:56.569 --> 00:54:56.579 align:start position:0%
state with our computer systems and uh
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
and how those are secured you can have
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
something that's secured but not private
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
so it might be secure in there but all
 
00:55:05.089 --> 00:55:05.099 align:start position:0%
of your information and data is flying
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
around for anybody to be able to access
 
00:55:08.569 --> 00:55:08.579 align:start position:0%
so long as they can get into that secure
 
00:55:11.569 --> 00:55:11.579 align:start position:0%
body what this bill does is it creates a
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
privacy Council in order to make sure
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Health and Human
 
00:55:17.569 --> 00:55:17.579 align:start position:0%
Services is taking the same proactive
 
00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:19.740 align:start position:0%
steps to protect personally identifiable
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
information as is done in the private
 
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
sector by having two jobs added that are
 
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
information so that our information
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
technology managers we will be able to
 
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
bring in experts that understand the
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
needs of privacy and know how to
 
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
structure these coming in from hopefully
 
00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.329 align:start position:0%
structure these coming in from hopefully
from

00:55:38.329 --> 00:55:38.339 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
no recruit from the best and figure out
 
00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:41.339 align:start position:0%
where whoever they're able to get to
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
come in and just make sure that they are
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
looking to privacy and making sure that
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
our information is kept as private as
 
00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
possible this is something that goes
 
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
along with article 2B in our
 
00:55:56.589 --> 00:55:56.599 align:start position:0%
constitution there will be public facing
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
minutes from them I know that in and
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's something where they're going
 
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
to be trying to make sure that we're not
 
00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
exposing the incredibly personal
 
00:56:08.329 --> 00:56:08.339 align:start position:0%
information that is kept at the
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
department for a surprising number of
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
people to vulnerabilities
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
thank you of the discussion
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes I'd like to speak in
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
opposition to this Bill yes thank you
 
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
this bill will cost taxpayers three
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars annually no
 
00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:29.420 align:start position:0%
evidence was provided that the current
 
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:32.700 align:start position:0%
DHHS security Protocols are lacking or
 
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
that user data has been or currently is
 
00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
being breached furthermore the greatest
 
00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:39.180 align:start position:0%
threats to privacy come from large
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
corporate or state actors as is common
 
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
practice the Security Professionals
 
00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
would likely store patient data on
 
00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
third-party corporate servers and use
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
software programs that are closed source
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
non-free and proprietary and therefore
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
would be inherently untrustworthy thank
 
00:56:58.250 --> 00:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:08.220 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.470 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
chair

00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
I also oppose the bill for slightly
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
different reasons one is
 
00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
why a legislative body has to tell an
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
executive branch to do something they
 
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
should be doing anyways
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
that's the first thing number two why
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
this is strictly in one agency versus
 
00:57:28.319 --> 00:57:29.569 align:start position:0%
this is strictly in one agency versus
Statewide

00:57:29.569 --> 00:57:29.579 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
the issue of privacy should be Statewide
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
not strictly looking at it from a
 
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
particular agency
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
and three we do already have oversight
 
00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
of DHHS and that oversight committee can
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
hold them accountable
 
00:57:43.849 --> 00:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
to achieve what we're trying to do
 
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
without this law so therefore I oppose
 
00:57:50.569 --> 00:57:50.579 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you representative Weber
 
00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:53.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I'm going to
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
vote for this bill
 
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:00.440 align:start position:0%
because I see it as being first of all
 
00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
the largest executive department that
 
00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
um so I privacy is a real concern there
 
00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh it's the bill we have in front of us
 
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
and it's a good first step and an
 
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
example for how to do it elsewhere if we
 
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
decide we need to do it elsewhere
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
um we tell executive departments what to
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
do all the time because we make the laws
 
00:58:36.609 --> 00:58:36.619 align:start position:0%
so I don't have a problem with that one
 
00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
but and the reason that I think that
 
00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:42.980 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable going ahead with it is
 
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
it is something that I think we thought
 
00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
thought to be doing and they aren't so
 
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
we said that let's make it a little more
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
clear what the expectations are so for
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
that reason I am going to vote in favor
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
of this I didn't vote for it last time
 
00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:03.740 align:start position:0%
because there were issues of
 
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:06.140 align:start position:0%
interrelationships between
 
00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
privacy and accessibility for uh the
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
people who were using the system but
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
this is just a board a freestanding
 
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
board so I'm going to vote in favor of
 
00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:21.410 align:start position:0%
board so I'm going to vote in favor of
it

00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
representative go to call are we allowed
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
to ask questions of each other
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
relative to what we've just said sure
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
um can I ask you a question of
 
00:59:36.049 --> 00:59:36.059 align:start position:0%
Representative King
 
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
what you said was really powerful
 
00:59:41.329 --> 00:59:41.339 align:start position:0%
um and I'm I'm curious you said that the
 
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
Privacy data that that
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
these private companies would access in
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
creating this this um platform they
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
could have access to and and use for
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
their own purposes could you
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
explain that further what's the risk of
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
that what's the likelihood of that I
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
just want to
 
01:00:02.089 --> 01:00:02.099 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
lots of times
 
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
um organizations they don't
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
um run their own servers on their own
 
01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
private Hardware they contract out for
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
to AWS Amazon
 
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
and we know from
 
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:20.220 align:start position:0%
history recent history it's well known
 
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
that third party corporate servers work
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
at the behest of intelligence agencies
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
they can be infiltrated from people that
 
01:00:29.089 --> 01:00:29.099 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have security
 
01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
clearance and that data often is and can
 
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
be sold to bidders around the world
 
01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:39.260 align:start position:0%
including the Chinese the Russians so
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
that is a serious problem and I
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
understand that my ideal world where we
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
store all of our own data and we use
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
only open source free and open source
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
software that's not going to happen
 
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
tomorrow but what I have a problem with
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
with this bill is that we're spending
 
01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
three hundred thousand dollars I asked
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
the people giving the testimony if they
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
had any evidence that data has been
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
recently or is being breached there was
 
01:01:08.569 --> 01:01:08.579 align:start position:0%
no answer given and furthermore I think
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
that the security protocols that these
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
professionals are going to use is
 
01:01:14.569 --> 01:01:14.579 align:start position:0%
basically just a waste of money because
 
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day this data is going
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
to be stored on corporate servers that I
 
01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
personally do not trust and I think
 
01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
if you if you if you if you have a
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
security I I'm a techie geek I have a
 
01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:30.839 align:start position:0%
background in these things and if you
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
understand just how uh vulnerable all of
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
our data is on just about everything
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
um you would see this as just a total
 
01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
another discussion
 
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
I just have a maybe I need to be
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
clarified I'm not arguing about the
 
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
money part but this is
 
01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say in here that they're
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
going to be hiring outside companies to
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
do this it's it's extra employees within
 
01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:02.809 align:start position:0%
do this it's it's extra employees within
the

01:02:02.809 --> 01:02:02.819 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
HHS to work with this board on increased
 
01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
security so I don't I don't I don't I'm
 
01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
not seeing how this is going to be
 
01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:14.339 align:start position:0%
additional new software that would have
 
01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
any more I mean it would be the whatever
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
HHS is using I would think so that any
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
vulnerability would would be there
 
01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
either way but hopefully this would be
 
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
leading to better monitoring of the
 
01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
software that we do have or that they
 
01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:30.260 align:start position:0%
are using
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
that's just the way I'm looking at it I
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
presented Leon
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um I think
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King is worried that
 
01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
we're putting a big a large set of bars
 
01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
and padlocks on the front door by
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
leaving a screen door on the back with
 
01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities with the system
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
um that that is an issue that I think
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
goes a lot broader than this bill and
 
01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
there's a bill House Bill 519 that is
 
01:02:56.329 --> 01:02:56.339 align:start position:0%
relative to establishing a chief
 
01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
information security officer for the
 
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology I
 
01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
think that making note of this
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
vulnerability and that you can't have
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
privacy without security is something
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
that is worth mentioning and is worth
 
01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:09.299 align:start position:0%
bringing forward because if it's not
 
01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
secure it won't be private but
 
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
fortunately I think that that issue is
 
01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's large there's a lot a
 
01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:19.140 align:start position:0%
larger effort to address that in House
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
Bill 519 this one's securing the front
 
01:03:23.089 --> 01:03:23.099 align:start position:0%
door from people getting to your
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
information on privacy and that one's
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
securing the back door I do think that
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
they're a pair and it's important to
 
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
it's important to secure both and I
 
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
think that it's a very valid point but I
 
01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill furthers securing
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
that front door in the privacy and
 
01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm supporting this board
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
that could be one of the recommendations
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
that comes from this board as well so I
 
01:03:43.849 --> 01:03:43.859 align:start position:0%
think that this is a good step even if
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
it is not complete
 
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
other yes representative Weber
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
do we know what committee fives the
 
01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
other bill is 519
 
01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
she's looking it up
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
it's an executive departments and
 
01:03:58.970 --> 01:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
administration yeah I thought we didn't
 
01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
have that one
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant given thank you
 
01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chair but given the fact that it's
 
01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
come to my attention on House Bill 519
 
01:04:12.049 --> 01:04:12.059 align:start position:0%
we're looking what I think appears to be
 
01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
the possibility redundancy between this
 
01:04:16.849 --> 01:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
bill and 519.
 
01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case I'd like to again
 
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
either retain this bill to find out
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
what's going on with 519 to be sure
 
01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
we're not building redundancy into two
 
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:28.140 align:start position:0%
requests at one
 
01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:29.230 align:start position:0%
requests at one
through

01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
Edna is going One Direction we're going
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
another Direction Where We could do one
 
01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
or the other and not both
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
I don't have enough information about
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:45.609 --> 01:04:45.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:47.930 --> 01:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
yes so I would point out that this this
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
bill is not strictly speaking a security
 
01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
bill this is a privacy and security Bill
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
and there are great many things
 
01:04:54.359 --> 01:04:55.130 align:start position:0%
and there are great many things
um

01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
and those topics often often are
 
01:05:00.289 --> 01:05:00.299 align:start position:0%
discussed hand in hand but in practice
 
01:05:00.299 --> 01:05:01.849 align:start position:0%
discussed hand in hand but in practice
they're

01:05:01.849 --> 01:05:01.859 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
there are very they're they're different
 
01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
topics and
 
01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
um information privacy often involves
 
01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:10.750 align:start position:0%
um information privacy often involves
um

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
it needs security as representative Leon
 
01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
has pointed out but it also involves
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
human factors it involves training it
 
01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
involves awareness it involves policies
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
and so I think that this is this goes
 
01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
far beyond security I think it's a step
 
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
in the right direction having having
 
01:05:30.289 --> 01:05:30.299 align:start position:0%
heard an earlier uh an earlier version
 
01:05:33.289 --> 01:05:33.299 align:start position:0%
of this in the last biennium I think
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
that this this bill's time has come I
 
01:05:37.370 --> 01:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
think it is much improved it's a step in
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
the right direction and I I would
 
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
support the uh the motion thank you of
 
01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative Weber do you have your
 
01:05:49.089 --> 01:05:49.099 align:start position:0%
hand up or
 
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry I I was also trying to
 
01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
pull up the text to the bill at the same
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
time uh
 
01:05:59.329 --> 01:05:59.339 align:start position:0%
I just want to remind people what this
 
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
bill actually does
 
01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
it creates
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
a governance board within the Department
 
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
but all of the people
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
that are in there are either in the
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
department itself or provide services to
 
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
the department so what you're doing
 
01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.690 align:start position:0%
the department so what you're doing
is

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:25.700 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
bringing all the people who might have
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
pieces of the puzzle when as it relates
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
to privacy together
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
at one time for once a month or once a
 
01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
quarter or whenever it convenes
 
01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
and making sure that they're talking to
 
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
each other
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
and yes we have some support in there
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
for that board because it's large and
 
01:06:51.490 --> 01:06:51.500 align:start position:0%
it's got a lot of work to do
 
01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
but I see that for me the coming
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
together of a bunch of people to to try
 
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
and solve problems that we think we're
 
01:07:03.049 --> 01:07:03.059 align:start position:0%
all agreed or really concerning problems
 
01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
is not a bad thing to do and although
 
01:07:11.049 --> 01:07:11.059 align:start position:0%
there are the larger issues of security
 
01:07:14.569 --> 01:07:14.579 align:start position:0%
and how that's handled and how the data
 
01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
is handled it's really not what this
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
bill is about except insofar as these
 
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
people might recommend that the data be
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
handled differently
 
01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
anyway so that I just wanted to be sure
 
01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
that we were all focused on what this
 
01:07:30.289 --> 01:07:30.299 align:start position:0%
bill actually does it doesn't mandate
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
where the data is going or what's
 
01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
happening with it it's creating
 
01:07:38.569 --> 01:07:38.579 align:start position:0%
as you will another layer of oversight
 
01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:42.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
okay I see no other discussion
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
with that I'll ask the clerk to call the
 
01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
roll again the motion is ought to pass
 
01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
is amended on House Bill 91.
 
01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:54.539 align:start position:0%

representative Nagel
 
01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:15.470 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel

representative Weber
 
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon yes
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter Upham yes
 
01:08:35.209 --> 01:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro yes
 
01:08:38.169 --> 01:08:38.179 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant no
 
01:08:42.829 --> 01:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer yes

representative Tellez
 
01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:53.150 align:start position:0%
representative Tellez
yes

01:08:53.150 --> 01:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:56.809 --> 01:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
representative representative Lanza yes
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
and representative McDonald yes
 
01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:03.110 align:start position:0%
and representative McDonald yes
18-2

01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
18-2
 
01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
okay and uh
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that might be a
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
Minority Report on this representative
 
01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
king or
 
01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:11.219 align:start position:0%
yes I'm happy to provide the Minority
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
Report so this will go on the regular
 
01:09:17.809 --> 01:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
are you not willing
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
he has to be willing as well there can't
 
01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
be a Minority Report if it goes on
 
01:09:23.819 --> 01:09:26.689 align:start position:0%
be a Minority Report if it goes on
consent

01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
we never have minority reports on
 
01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
consent so if there's a Minority Report
 
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
it needs to go on the regular calendar
 
01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.550 align:start position:0%
it needs to go on the regular calendar
okay

01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
but okay can it go on uh yes can you go
 
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
on consent calendar with two two no's
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
it can go on the Quezon calendar with
 
01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
two no's if both of the people who voted
 
01:09:50.329 --> 01:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
no agree to it and if neither one of
 
01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
them wants to write a Minority Report
 
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
but representative King has said that he
 
01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
wants to write a Minority Report and if
 
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
there is a Minority Report it can't go
 
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
on consent because it has to go on the
 
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
regular calendar because it has a
 
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
Minority Report
 
01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you I just didn't hear both of the
 
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
representatives being asked if they were
 
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
willing for it to go on the consent
 
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
calendar well one of them that's because
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
one of them had already stated he wanted
 
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
to write a Minority Report which
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
precludes it going unconsent under any
 
01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.169 align:start position:0%
precludes it going unconsent under any
circumstances

01:10:24.169 --> 01:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions on this
 
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
moving on to House Bill 329 Mr chairman
 
01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:34.510 align:start position:0%
moving on to House Bill 329 Mr chairman
yes

01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
for my Records who made the motion to
 
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
and who was the one that made the second
 
01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.870 align:start position:0%
and who was the one that made the second
bomber

01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
bomber
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Leon moved and
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer second thank you
 
01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:52.610 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer second thank you
okay

01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
all right moving on to House Bill 329
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy yes I would like
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
to make a motion that we retain house
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
bill 329.
 
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
and is there a second to that second
 
01:11:06.169 --> 01:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel seconds
 
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy would you like to
 
01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes please thank
 
01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:10.070 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes please thank
you

01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:10.750 align:start position:0%
you
um

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
briefly speaking I think that we can all
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
recognize and agree that you know
 
01:11:17.209 --> 01:11:17.219 align:start position:0%
medical Registries have been of
 
01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
significant benefit to
 
01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
you know many many people including
 
01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
probably many of us in this room
 
01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think it's in dispute that
 
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
a registry for ALS patients which suffer
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
a very devastating disease is
 
01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
inappropriate in any way shape or form
 
01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
to discover
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
etiologies treatments and ultimately how
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
we can cure that disease uh when we
 
01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
first drafted the I was approached by Dr
 
01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
Elijah stomal who you met last week
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
a neurologist at Dartmouth who has been
 
01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
doing a tremendous amount of work for
 
01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
many years with ALS patients
 
01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
he asked me to put a registry forward in
 
01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
in doing so and with the the strong work
 
01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:55.370 align:start position:0%
in doing so and with the the strong work
of

01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
um Attorney John Williams we were able
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
to come up with a initial attempt at a
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
registry bill that you saw last week the
 
01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
bill had with it obviously a significant
 
01:12:09.290 --> 01:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
fiscal note which is tied obviously to
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
the oversight of HHS
 
01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
um in doing so and that's not that's not
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with other registries in
 
01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
the in the state whereby they um for can
 
01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
we have multiple cancer Registries we
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
have infectious disease Registries we
 
01:12:27.169 --> 01:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
have a lot of colorectal Registries
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
colonoscopy Registries and they have
 
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
contractual relationships oftentimes
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
with HHS
 
01:12:36.169 --> 01:12:36.179 align:start position:0%
um what we have attempted to do to Pivot
 
01:12:38.689 --> 01:12:38.699 align:start position:0%
away from having this under the auspices
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
Control Authority
 
01:12:43.729 --> 01:12:43.739 align:start position:0%
um to establish and then run a registry
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
at HHS with crafted another a bill an
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
amended bill which is essentially ready
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
but what it also assumes uh is that
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
number one there will be no HHS
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
involvement therefore there will be no
 
01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
fiscal note attached to it
 
01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
um so there'll be absolutely no cost to
 
01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
the state in a sense they'll be
 
01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
reporting to HHS but the registry would
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
be housed established in operationally
 
01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
administered to uh at Dartmouth
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock we're essentially 99 of all
 
01:13:19.689 --> 01:13:19.699 align:start position:0%
the ALS patients go
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
from the state currently so this would
 
01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
establish a registry it would also
 
01:13:27.050 --> 01:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
maintain a mandatory reporting by
 
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
physicians and providers that diagnose
 
01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
these patients it will be free from the
 
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
oversight of HHS and the only reason and
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that I'm asking to
 
01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
retain it at this point is in order to
 
01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
shift the oversight and establishment of
 
01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:47.699 align:start position:0%
this registry to Dartmouth Health we
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
need to clear the hurdles with legal
 
01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
with I.T with some educational documents
 
01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
who will administer the data how will
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
the data be collected how will we get
 
01:13:59.930 --> 01:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
the data from outside you know
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
Physicians who are not DH related so
 
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
there's a number of small I wouldn't say
 
01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
small but a number of issues which are
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
surmountable but we could not actually
 
01:14:12.050 --> 01:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
get done within the past week so what we
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
have done is draft a a subsequent bill
 
01:14:18.649 --> 01:14:18.659 align:start position:0%
that will basically put the registry in
 
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
the hands of Dartmouth health and once
 
01:14:24.169 --> 01:14:24.179 align:start position:0%
we clear the hurdles that I just
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
mentioned I will bring it back in the
 
01:14:28.189 --> 01:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
fall if that is the wish of the
 
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
committee so that's where we stand right
 
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
now thank you okay another discussion
 
01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
motion to retain
 
01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
I was Bill 329.
 
01:14:41.689 --> 01:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
seeing no other discussion
 
01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:44.340 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the Clarks Colorado
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:14:47.689 --> 01:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
it's a representative representative
 
01:14:50.689 --> 01:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
Nagel second did it thank you
 
01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:53.640 align:start position:0%

representative Shapiro
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant a point of order
 
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
if I may I want to be sure it was okay
 
01:15:37.610 --> 01:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I stepped out of the room
 
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
for a second before I came back in so I
 
01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
don't know if I can actually vote I
 
01:15:43.729 --> 01:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
think I can but were you here yes yes
 
01:15:50.450 --> 01:15:50.460 align:start position:0%

representative McDonald yes
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
and it's 20 to zero
 
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
and this does not need to go on the
 
01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:15.900 align:start position:0%

representative McLean do you have an
emotion

01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:39.780 align:start position:0%

yeah thank you Mr I move itl on this
 
01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:43.490 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr I move itl on this
bill

01:16:43.490 --> 01:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second
 
01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
I'd like to Second representative mazur
 
01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:50.110 align:start position:0%
I'd like to Second representative mazur
seconds

01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:51.900 align:start position:0%
representative McLean do you want to
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes thank you Mr
 
01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:54.649 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes thank you Mr
chair

01:16:54.649 --> 01:16:54.659 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
um I I think uh the problem that this
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
bill tries to address is real
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
um and I have a lot of Sympathy for the
 
01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
folks bringing this forward and and
 
01:17:08.450 --> 01:17:08.460 align:start position:0%
that's why we have a special committee
 
01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
trying to address this issue but if you
 
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
look at the the financials that are in
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
the Bill versus the the mountain that it
 
01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
has to go over we heard testimony that
 
01:17:23.689 --> 01:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
in Vermont uh they're making six
 
01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars more a year
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
in Maine 8 000 and in Massachusetts 10
 
01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
000 more a year what this bill does
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
after it gets through excuse me just a
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
second everybody knows it's the child
 
01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
care bill right I know there was some
 
01:17:39.169 --> 01:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
confusion earlier what bills were up so
 
01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry go ahead so I'm sorry so
 
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:45.300 align:start position:0%
um so what the way that this bill would
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
work is it would give retention bonuses
 
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
when you come on board and then at three
 
01:17:52.729 --> 01:17:52.739 align:start position:0%
years and then at five years and then
 
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
every five years after that so basically
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
you're looking at three thousand dollars
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
a retention bonus every five years
 
01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
if you look at Massachusetts where
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
you're making ten thousand dollars a
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
year more and that say same five year
 
01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
period That's fifty thousand dollars
 
01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
versus three thousand dollars so I think
 
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
we're going to be putting money that you
 
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
know we're gonna need and I don't think
 
01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
this is going to achieve what it's going
 
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
to do three thousand dollars is not
 
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
going to shift the needle versus fifty
 
01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so
 
01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
um uh I I would uh prefer to wait to see
 
01:18:29.209 --> 01:18:29.219 align:start position:0%
what comes out of the special committee
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
and I would uh be looking to it all this
 
01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chair
 
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
another discussion yes representative
 
01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.669 align:start position:0%
another discussion yes representative
Shapiro

01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
Shapiro
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
I will vote to support this bill
 
01:18:43.729 --> 01:18:43.739 align:start position:0%
um I agree with some of the things that
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
were said that it's a lot of money that
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
it will not solve the problem in itself
 
01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:49.790 align:start position:0%
it will not solve the problem in itself
um

01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:52.669 --> 01:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
I was taken with some of the people who
 
01:18:55.010 --> 01:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
testified with who talked about this
 
01:18:58.189 --> 01:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
sending a strong message to people who
 
01:19:01.729 --> 01:19:01.739 align:start position:0%
are working in daycare who owners who
 
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
are hemorrhaging employees that um that
 
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
the state cares about this situation and
 
01:19:09.169 --> 01:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
that they're looking to do something I
 
01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
think this is just a small part of the
 
01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
puzzle but I think it's a part of the
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
puzzle nevertheless and I think we
 
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
should concentrate on the policy of
 
01:19:24.649 --> 01:19:24.659 align:start position:0%
helping the workforce and in in daycare
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
and let the finance committee deal with
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
the amounts of money that it um
 
01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
that it needs
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Shapiro
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
and just to elaborate a little bit for
 
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
myself on what representative Shapiro
 
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
just said I I do agree with some of the
 
01:19:44.209 --> 01:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
concerns that you have uh but
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
procedurally uh if we send this to the
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
bill to the floor as an itl
 
01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
we have effectively
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
foreclosed this option for ourselves not
 
01:19:59.090 --> 01:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
only for this year but for next year as
 
01:19:59.100 --> 01:19:59.870 align:start position:0%
only for this year but for next year as
well

01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:20:02.209 --> 01:20:02.219 align:start position:0%
because it can't come back
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
and so I too would urge that we do one
 
01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
of two things either
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
pass this bill on the policy and send it
 
01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
to finance where they can put it in the
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
pot with all of the other
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
things that they're considering or that
 
01:20:26.209 --> 01:20:26.219 align:start position:0%
perhaps we retain it in committee so so
 
01:20:28.729 --> 01:20:28.739 align:start position:0%
that we can see where people are going
 
01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
and and use it next year to work on more
 
01:20:36.649 --> 01:20:36.659 align:start position:0%
if if we need to uh rather than killing
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
it outright so I am certainly opposing
 
01:20:40.729 --> 01:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
the itl
 
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
um I I could be persuaded either way on
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
the other two motions but my preference
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
would be to pass and send it to finance
 
01:20:51.610 --> 01:20:51.620 align:start position:0%
but I'm concerned about it
 
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
dying completely either here on the
 
01:20:56.209 --> 01:20:56.219 align:start position:0%
floor so a retained motion would also be
 
01:20:58.970 --> 01:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
I think perfectly appropriate thank you
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
thank you I want to follow with
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned about if we do an itl
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
and gets to the floor
 
01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
and it passes with itl then we also have
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
indefinite postponement that we really
 
01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
get ourselves into a situation where we
 
01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
can't take up something comfortable
 
01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:22.980 align:start position:0%
because the topic itself has been killed
 
01:21:24.649 --> 01:21:24.659 align:start position:0%
and we don't know what's going to come
 
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
out of the commission so I do support
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
what you're saying as far as retaining
 
01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
and that way there we can wait for the
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
commission to do its work and find out
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
if in fact the commission decides that
 
01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
something like this isn't in play and
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
the topic is Germaine then next year we
 
01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
can take up the bill again and modify it
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
through amendments but if we itl it it
 
01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
goes to the house again and it gets
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
indefinite postponement we're really
 
01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.310 align:start position:0%
indefinite postponement we're really
sunk

01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
sunk
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.149 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
chairman

01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:21:55.130 --> 01:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
um I I think that while we're looking at
 
01:21:56.570 --> 01:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
these dollar figures we're also looking
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
at the policy of subsidizing a private
 
01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
industry and having these subsidies to
 
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
go to offset wages
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
that is actually a pretty chilling
 
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
precedent because once you get the
 
01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
government involved in paying part of
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
the wages you're moving to this
 
01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
public-private partnership that before
 
01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
has been called things like fascism when
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
you have the government and private
 
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
business to intertwined things get very
 
01:22:23.810 --> 01:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
very dangerous when we look at this bill
 
01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
in the policy
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
the question would be how much should
 
01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
the state pay should all these child
 
01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
care workers be employees I don't think
 
01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
anybody in the state would say that they
 
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
should be state employees I think that
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
there are many many other avenues
 
01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
available for the special committee on
 
01:22:40.729 --> 01:22:40.739 align:start position:0%
child care to look at but I don't think
 
01:22:42.669 --> 01:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
that subsidies are the New Hampshire way
 
01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
subsidies in order to supplement wages
 
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
it this is exactly what got us into the
 
01:22:50.689 --> 01:22:50.699 align:start position:0%
inflationary environment that we are in
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
today when you look at these subsidies
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
that has raised the price of everything
 
01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
in order to provide the services the
 
01:22:58.729 --> 01:22:58.739 align:start position:0%
companies need to rate the prices as
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
they raise the prices then it gets
 
01:23:02.570 --> 01:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
harder for everybody those who have a
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
pot of money that they can access
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
especially if it's not their own are
 
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
able to supplement it and those who are
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
left on the margins like our child care
 
01:23:12.410 --> 01:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
workers and the families paying for it
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
are then left bearing the brunt of
 
01:23:17.209 --> 01:23:17.219 align:start position:0%
inflation from the government trying to
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
do good we've heard these families
 
01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
already or at least the federal
 
01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
government has hurt these families
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
already by the all the checks that were
 
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
sent out during covid to try and
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
supplement the losses that economic
 
01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
policy has come home to roost in this
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
inflation and in what is making Child
 
01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
Care unaffordable for families in New
 
01:23:39.169 --> 01:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this bill only doubles down on
 
01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
those failed policies and I believe that
 
01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
it should be in should be voted and
 
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and should get to
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:23:51.290 --> 01:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
um part of the testimony we heard was
 
01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
that the that governor sununu was
 
01:23:55.490 --> 01:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
looking towards public-private
 
01:23:57.649 --> 01:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
Partnerships for this particular issue
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason I'd at least like
 
01:24:02.209 --> 01:24:02.219 align:start position:0%
to retain the bill so we can see where
 
01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
the commission comes and what the
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
governor wants to do rather than having
 
01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
us kill it
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
01:24:13.370 --> 01:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
yes I I would take exception to
 
01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
um equating this bill with fascism
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
um for one and I would say that we only
 
01:24:20.930 --> 01:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
have to look towards how we you know who
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
we call when our house is on fire we
 
01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
call the fire department and that is
 
01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
publicly supported
 
01:24:32.090 --> 01:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
um in in retirement we are supported in
 
01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:33.470 align:start position:0%
um in in retirement we are supported in
part

01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
um for some of us in total for many of
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
us by Medicare our public schools are
 
01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
paid for not enough but in part by the
 
01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
total State and I think that um you know
 
01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
you may I understand that that some
 
01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
people would disagree that this is going
 
01:24:59.630 --> 01:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
to be effective but I think personally
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
that may be the case but it's not
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
because we're
 
01:25:07.090 --> 01:25:07.100 align:start position:0%
um introducing the state into a service
 
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
that is necessary for individual people
 
01:25:13.729 --> 01:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
for families and for the state economy I
 
01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
mean I think we heard over and over
 
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
again that this is not a system that so
 
01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:23.719 align:start position:0%
far has responded to the market
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
you can't just keep raising
 
01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.189 align:start position:0%
you can't just keep raising
um

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
tuition for people
 
01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
in order to get enough money to pay
 
01:25:36.169 --> 01:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
people a living wage it's there's it's
 
01:25:38.209 --> 01:25:38.219 align:start position:0%
broken it doesn't work there needs to be
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
something else introduced so
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
I would take exception to the fact that
 
01:25:42.239 --> 01:25:44.570 align:start position:0%
I would take exception to the fact that
introducing

01:25:44.570 --> 01:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
introducing
 
01:25:47.689 --> 01:25:47.699 align:start position:0%
Public Funding into this system
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
um is um
 
01:25:53.209 --> 01:25:53.219 align:start position:0%
to be equated with fascism in some way
 
01:25:55.970 --> 01:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
of the discussion
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
by representative Leon thank you Mr
 
01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and I apologize if that was
 
01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
taken as saying that this bill is
 
01:26:04.729 --> 01:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
fascism I was taking it to a possible
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
conclusion of it being fully State fully
 
01:26:11.629 --> 01:26:11.639 align:start position:0%
subsidizing the the the income of those
 
01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
child care providers but this would be a
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
step towards that intertwining our fire
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
departments participate in the state
 
01:26:20.209 --> 01:26:20.219 align:start position:0%
retirement system which is a choice that
 
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
was made for these public so while I
 
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
while I see that there are some of these
 
01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
points where we do have entanglement I
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
think that this is pretty far outside
 
01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
those other ones but I'll in the
 
01:26:31.610 --> 01:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
interest of getting along I'll back off
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
from that and we can continue with some
 
01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:35.639 align:start position:0%
of these other policy points I know this
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
has been a great committee working
 
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
together and I don't want to rub on any
 
01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
of the source slots that anybody has
 
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
of the discussion oh yes representative
 
01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:46.070 align:start position:0%
of the discussion oh yes representative
kofault

01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
kofault
 
01:26:48.649 --> 01:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
um yes so Milton Friedman famously uh
 
01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
created a four quadrant grid
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
um on the top I believe it says who's
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
paying for it and on the side it says
 
01:26:57.890 --> 01:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
who are they who are they buying it for
 
01:27:01.010 --> 01:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
and um you know if if you're if you're
 
01:27:02.810 --> 01:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
spending your own money on something you
 
01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
want you're gonna you're gonna shop
 
01:27:06.290 --> 01:27:06.300 align:start position:0%
value you're gonna get your money's
 
01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:07.910 align:start position:0%
value you're gonna get your money's
worth

01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
worth
 
01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
um I I think that if we are
 
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
subsidizing system if we're turning
 
01:27:17.209 --> 01:27:17.219 align:start position:0%
daycare into a publicly funded entity uh
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to go the way a lot of these
 
01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
things go which is
 
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
um we're spending other people's money
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
on something for other people and that
 
01:27:29.450 --> 01:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
is actually the lowest the lowest value
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
quadrant in Milton Friedman's equation
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
so I I think this is
 
01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.649 align:start position:0%
so I I think this is
um

01:27:36.649 --> 01:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
the wrong solution to to a problem that
 
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
does need to be fixed and I think that
 
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
it's it's one that will be a slippery
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
slope if we start to go down this road
 
01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
um there we will end up going further
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
down this road and I think creating a
 
01:27:51.970 --> 01:27:51.980 align:start position:0%
lot of unintended consequences
 
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.550 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't per se in this
 
01:28:07.370 --> 01:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
bill but came up in the testimony
 
01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:09.229 align:start position:0%
bill but came up in the testimony
many

01:28:09.229 --> 01:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
businesses that want to do Child Care
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
struggle with startup cost and we have a
 
01:28:16.189 --> 01:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
small business administration one of the
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
things I did hear about was maybe trying
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
to help them get it
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
business up and running which is giving
 
01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
the money to the employees themselves
 
01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
I would like to retain this bill and
 
01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
work on those kind of options and saying
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
how do we build into the system
 
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
more child care opportunities because if
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
we don't have child care what I heard
 
01:28:41.810 --> 01:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
was that an increase with women
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
participation rates of 1.3 percent to
 
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
the economy of the states a billion
 
01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:47.270 align:start position:0%
the economy of the states a billion
dollars

01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
so I think there's enough incentive here
 
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
to find a way to work our way through it
 
01:28:53.689 --> 01:28:53.699 align:start position:0%
but we can't get there if we don't
 
01:28:56.090 --> 01:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
retain the bill and begin to think about
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
various options so the policy of trying
 
01:29:02.330 --> 01:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
to find a way to increase more access
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
to increase our economy and help those
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
get involved with the economy through
 
01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
Workforce which is a problem
 
01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
therefore I really would like to have us
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
retain the bill
 
01:29:14.450 --> 01:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
for two reasons one work on it but more
 
01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
importantly listen to the governor's
 
01:29:18.290 --> 01:29:18.300 align:start position:0%
Commission in saying what's coming out
 
01:29:20.330 --> 01:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
of that one as well and give us some
 
01:29:23.450 --> 01:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
time to hear all that we need to hear to
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
make it work
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
I have to agree with representative
 
01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.149 align:start position:0%
I have to agree with representative
Merchant

01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
01:29:32.159 --> 01:29:34.010 align:start position:0%
Merchant
um

01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:37.090 --> 01:29:37.100 align:start position:0%
it's a challenge that I've I've seen
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
where families want to go to work but
 
01:29:42.290 --> 01:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
they have kids that need to be taken
 
01:29:45.229 --> 01:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
care of and the businesses they're going
 
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
into don't have child care
 
01:29:50.330 --> 01:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
there so they're somewhat dependent on
 
01:29:52.129 --> 01:29:52.139 align:start position:0%
trying to find other sources for child
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
care the child care organizations have
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
the problem is they it's that trying to
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
find employees to provide that child
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
care is expensive
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
and they have trouble trying to bind
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
people to to take those jobs so there's
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
a couple of catch-22s here it's round
 
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
and round and round so I I would like I
 
01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
I too would like to retain the bill
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
because it's something is needed uh and
 
01:30:23.570 --> 01:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
to try and figure out
 
01:30:26.930 --> 01:30:26.940 align:start position:0%
um do we give money to the just to the
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
child care organizations or do we find a
 
01:30:31.090 --> 01:30:31.100 align:start position:0%
way to
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
encourage organizations to to put child
 
01:30:37.129 --> 01:30:37.139 align:start position:0%
care as a part of those those
 
01:30:39.649 --> 01:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
organizations and how do we do that do
 
01:30:42.050 --> 01:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
we give them some sort of break or or
 
01:30:44.090 --> 01:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
whatever it's got there's got to be a
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
way to do that if you want to get your
 
01:30:47.689 --> 01:30:47.699 align:start position:0%
employees on board you need to help find
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
them child care for their their kids
 
01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative Palazzo
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I agree with the
 
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative land that it's not a
 
01:31:05.090 --> 01:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
problem for government to fund this and
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
I support the itl so two points first uh
 
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
I think this industry is in a perfect
 
01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
spot to self-regulate
 
01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
one of concerns that they cannot pay
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
more because otherwise
 
01:31:23.090 --> 01:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
they would lose clients but we heard
 
01:31:26.330 --> 01:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
testimonies one place has 80 people
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
waiting list and another place had 87
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
people waiting list it's a perfect spot
 
01:31:37.450 --> 01:31:37.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:43.689 --> 01:31:43.699 align:start position:0%
a child care workers more and the second
 
01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
concern was that we cannot charge
 
01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
parents more but if we look into our
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
Public Schools it's what's happening in
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
my sit here is that so now it's like
 
01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
they spent like 20
 
01:32:05.810 --> 01:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
000 a year per pupil and what does it
 
01:32:08.450 --> 01:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
mean it means that parents pay more in
 
01:32:12.169 --> 01:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
taxes so when you say that parents
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
cannot pay more let's let's subsidize it
 
01:32:18.050 --> 01:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
it just means that they will be paying
 
01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
more in taxes thank you thank you
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:32:28.189 --> 01:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
in my ideal world it would be fantastic
 
01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
if we got back to the point where we
 
01:32:35.290 --> 01:32:35.300 align:start position:0%
were just a few decades ago where
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
one income could fully support an entire
 
01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
family and Mom could stay home and raise
 
01:32:44.450 --> 01:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
her kids
 
01:32:47.209 --> 01:32:47.219 align:start position:0%
or down in that case that matter of fact
 
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
my father spent more time at home with
 
01:32:52.669 --> 01:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
me and my mom worked away
 
01:32:55.610 --> 01:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
um but that's my Ideal World
 
01:32:59.330 --> 01:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
when we increase everybody's taxes to
 
01:33:02.930 --> 01:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
pay for child care what and among other
 
01:33:05.570 --> 01:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
things what we're doing is we're now
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
we're making it less financially viable
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
for one parent to stay home and raise
 
01:33:17.209 --> 01:33:17.219 align:start position:0%
the child especially when the costs of
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
sending them off to daycare have been
 
01:33:21.709 --> 01:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
subsidized by the government
 
01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
and so now what we I mean there's so so
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
many problems I know we're not going to
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
get to my ideal solution tomorrow but
 
01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
this is just another nail in the coffin
 
01:33:34.129 --> 01:33:34.139 align:start position:0%
of making it less possible and
 
01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
incentivizing making it less possible to
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
stay home and raise your children making
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
it more financially a requirement to
 
01:33:43.729 --> 01:33:43.739 align:start position:0%
send them to daycare and furthermore
 
01:33:45.890 --> 01:33:45.900 align:start position:0%
um I often had to go to a nanny when I
 
01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
was a kid I went to a lady who
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
um she was a stay-at-home mom and she
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
would have two or three kids that she
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
would raise or help raise during the
 
01:33:58.850 --> 01:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
daytime this was not a huge source of
 
01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
income for her it was just a little bit
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
of money on the side but we had amazing
 
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
care and when we in in when we
 
01:34:09.890 --> 01:34:09.900 align:start position:0%
turn it into an industry now we're
 
01:34:13.010 --> 01:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
sending our children off to corporate
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
okay a court a business a real business
 
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
a corporate model of daycare as opposed
 
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
to just the lady down the door and I
 
01:34:23.110 --> 01:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
don't like that either I like
 
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
decentralization I don't like
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
centralization and I definitely don't
 
01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
like government getting involved with
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
business because it might start off pure
 
01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
but eventually there's going to be this
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
thing known as regulatory capture and
 
01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
the industries are going to now all of a
 
01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
sudden pass laws that are going to make
 
01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
it impossible for the lady down the door
 
01:34:44.450 --> 01:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
to get into the business because they're
 
01:34:45.410 --> 01:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
going to be so many rules and
 
01:34:47.090 --> 01:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
regulations that she just will opt out
 
01:34:49.129 --> 01:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
completely and now we're inadvertently
 
01:34:51.530 --> 01:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
taking away the number of child care
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
providers that exist in the world so so
 
01:34:55.490 --> 01:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
I know that this is just three thousand
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
dollars every five years it's not a huge
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
amount of money but it's just one more
 
01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
nail in the coffin of what the true goal
 
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
should be which is one parent being able
 
01:35:05.689 --> 01:35:05.699 align:start position:0%
to afford raising an entire family and
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
the other person stays home and raises
 
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
kids that's that's my goal this this is
 
01:35:11.689 --> 01:35:11.699 align:start position:0%
the opposite of that goal thank you yes
 
01:35:11.699 --> 01:35:13.370 align:start position:0%
the opposite of that goal thank you yes
representative

01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:35:16.490 --> 01:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I I also
 
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes uh yearn for the days when
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
life seemed a bit more ideal but I have
 
01:35:23.930 --> 01:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
come to realize with a bit more gray
 
01:35:26.330 --> 01:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
hair that you know oftentimes I have to
 
01:35:28.850 --> 01:35:28.860 align:start position:0%
deal with the hand that I'm given and we
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
are dealing with a huge crisis with
 
01:35:34.129 --> 01:35:34.139 align:start position:0%
child care in this country in our state
 
01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
we we heard it you know Ad nauseam the
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
other day right
 
01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
but the way I look at it is also that
 
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
this would be a huge return on
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
investment for our state we would be
 
01:35:46.729 --> 01:35:46.739 align:start position:0%
bringing in younger people we would be
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
supporting the people that go to work
 
01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
that don't want to work in Target I I
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
shop at Target it's not a bad place I
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with Target per se
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to see the people that
 
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
chose to take care of kids and educate
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
young children be eroded I mean that is
 
01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
really an eroding industry and so though
 
01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
I also don't like to subsidize any
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
industry unnecessarily but I also know
 
01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
that we are in a crisis position where
 
01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
we need to address and that's why I
 
01:36:21.169 --> 01:36:21.179 align:start position:0%
would agree with Dr Merchant I mean with
 
01:36:21.179 --> 01:36:22.209 align:start position:0%
would agree with Dr Merchant I mean with
uh

01:36:22.209 --> 01:36:22.219 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant that we if we
 
01:36:27.649 --> 01:36:27.659 align:start position:0%
could at least consider retaining it so
 
01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
that we can actually figure out a
 
01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:31.860 align:start position:0%
solution rather than just shut the door
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
on this group of people that really
 
01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
depend on us
 
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
State the government does subsidize you
 
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
know a lot of things in our lives
 
01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
oftentimes there is not a return on
 
01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
investment which is of any benefit this
 
01:36:47.209 --> 01:36:47.219 align:start position:0%
does have a return on investment this
 
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
will increase the workforce it will
 
01:36:50.689 --> 01:36:50.699 align:start position:0%
increase the younger Workforce it will
 
01:36:52.970 --> 01:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
also to some degree at least the message
 
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
will help to increase the number of
 
01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
people that want to work in New
 
01:36:59.390 --> 01:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I I would I would urge us
 
01:37:01.129 --> 01:37:01.139 align:start position:0%
to try to retain this and work on it
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
versus just throwing it down the toilet
 
01:37:04.729 --> 01:37:04.739 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you am I
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to say Thank you Mr chairman
 
01:37:10.729 --> 01:37:10.739 align:start position:0%
again I'm sorry am I supposed to say
 
01:37:13.250 --> 01:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
Thank you Mr chairman or here too uh
 
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever
 
01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm all for spending eight million
 
01:37:24.050 --> 01:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
dollars if you get eight million dollars
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
plus in return
 
01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
um that I think the most compelling
 
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
thing that was said was somebody said
 
01:37:32.689 --> 01:37:32.699 align:start position:0%
that they were losing employees to
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
Target as you say I think we need to
 
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
remember we're just looking this is a
 
01:37:39.410 --> 01:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
crisis but we're just looking at the tip
 
01:37:42.770 --> 01:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
of the iceberg in addition to child care
 
01:37:45.050 --> 01:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
I sit on boards that oversee nine
 
01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:47.159 align:start position:0%
nursing homes that face the exact same
 
01:37:50.689 --> 01:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
problems I sit on I own believe it or
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
not a couple of medical businesses now
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
that we're about 20 percent uh
 
01:37:57.229 --> 01:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
underemployed right now
 
01:37:59.930 --> 01:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
um I I'm on two hospitals that are
 
01:38:01.729 --> 01:38:01.739 align:start position:0%
totally unemployed all these people are
 
01:38:04.010 --> 01:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
competing for the same pool of people
 
01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
with Walmart Target wherever and my
 
01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
concern is yes we want to spend I think
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
it was eight roughly eight million
 
01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
dollars over three years to get us back
 
01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
to the exact same place we are now I
 
01:38:17.689 --> 01:38:17.699 align:start position:0%
just don't see this as going to change
 
01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
the labor force change their
 
01:38:21.050 --> 01:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
competitiveness at all
 
01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
I I am leaning towards this retaining
 
01:38:23.699 --> 01:38:24.950 align:start position:0%
I I am leaning towards this retaining
thing

01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:38:27.770 --> 01:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
um and and as as representative Leon
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
said see what this committee comes up
 
01:38:31.850 --> 01:38:31.860 align:start position:0%
with I just don't personally see this as
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
a good long-term strategy I think we
 
01:38:35.870 --> 01:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
need to have a better long-term strategy
 
01:38:38.330 --> 01:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
that reflects everybody's needs so that
 
01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
we we hope
 
01:38:42.590 --> 01:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of people not just this
 
01:38:45.530 --> 01:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber
 
01:38:48.050 --> 01:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you I I would agree with that and
 
01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
I but I also I just want to be sure that
 
01:38:54.649 --> 01:38:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
um I am also concerned you know this is
 
01:39:01.970 --> 01:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
a this issue in in Gross rather than the
 
01:39:04.129 --> 01:39:04.139 align:start position:0%
bill in front of us which we made
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
certain efforts to send to either the
 
01:39:08.689 --> 01:39:08.699 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee or the
 
01:39:12.169 --> 01:39:12.179 align:start position:0%
committee on child care what a concept
 
01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
but we were told that it was too late
 
01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:17.890 align:start position:0%
but we were told that it was too late
um

01:39:17.890 --> 01:39:17.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
we were just told no
 
01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:21.350 align:start position:0%
we were just told no
um

01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:24.110 --> 01:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
which boggles my mind but anyway
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
um you know this is a priority of
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
business and industry there's all the
 
01:39:31.250 --> 01:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
issues of young young people staying in
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
the state they're the ones who are
 
01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
looking for the child care and the
 
01:39:36.649 --> 01:39:36.659 align:start position:0%
housing and all those other things that
 
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
bring to bear on the whole big picture
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to point out that you know
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
for us to sit here and discuss the huge
 
01:39:51.110 --> 01:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
issues of why we aren't having one
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
parent stay home anymore I'm going to
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
point out that the last time that
 
01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
happened was in the Eisenhower
 
01:40:00.169 --> 01:40:00.179 align:start position:0%
Administration when the highest marginal
 
01:40:05.090 --> 01:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
federal tax rate was over 90 percent
 
01:40:09.709 --> 01:40:09.719 align:start position:0%
um so things have changed a lot and if I
 
01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
were in charge of revamping the federal
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
tax structure I could do a lot because
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
none of those Yachts would be deductible
 
01:40:20.570 --> 01:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
and uh but I can't do that and that's
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
not what we're faced with here today
 
01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:24.110 align:start position:0%
not what we're faced with here today
so

01:40:24.110 --> 01:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:25.490 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:40:25.490 --> 01:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:29.330 --> 01:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
I do urge people to overturn oh and
 
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
don't get me started on the public
 
01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
school public money that is now
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
subsidizing private and religious
 
01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:36.590 align:start position:0%
subsidizing private and religious
schools

01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:40:41.209 --> 01:40:41.219 align:start position:0%
because it's exactly the same thing so
 
01:40:43.490 --> 01:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
um I would I would I would hope that
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
people would would retain I I think this
 
01:40:48.590 --> 01:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
is probably not ultimately going to be
 
01:40:50.930 --> 01:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
the right solution but
 
01:40:53.930 --> 01:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
um I would love to leave the universe of
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
possible solutions as wide as possible
 
01:40:58.430 --> 01:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
for the future
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you point of order Mr chair yes um
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
did we have a second
 
01:41:06.050 --> 01:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
um on this motion and if so
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
we did have a second yes representative
 
01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
okay does that mean does that mean we
 
01:41:13.450 --> 01:41:13.460 align:start position:0%
will vote on it well
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
moving party in the second inning party
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
could it should they choose to do so
 
01:41:25.490 --> 01:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
um withdraw the motion and the second
 
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
but if neither unless that happens then
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
we we need to vote on it
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative Jeff your hand up a
 
01:41:35.450 --> 01:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
moment ago or I'm sorry
 
01:41:37.070 --> 01:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
is there any other discussion on this
 
01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:39.350 align:start position:0%
is there any other discussion on this
motion

01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.370 align:start position:0%
motion
okay

01:41:40.370 --> 01:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
um what I would like to do
 
01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry okay representative Shapiro
 
01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.910 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry okay representative Shapiro
again

01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:50.330 --> 01:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
I I would just like to say that um
 
01:41:53.810 --> 01:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
my opinions have has changed hearing the
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
discussion and um
 
01:41:58.689 --> 01:41:58.699 align:start position:0%
whereas I said I would vote um against
 
01:42:02.510 --> 01:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
itl and vote um Auto pass I would be in
 
01:42:05.330 --> 01:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
favor now of retaining the bill and I I
 
01:42:07.010 --> 01:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
would um
 
01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
I will try to put my ideology and
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
philosophy aside and I would ask other
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
people to try to do the same and um and
 
01:42:19.129 --> 01:42:19.139 align:start position:0%
just keep an idea in the larger pot
 
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
um of things to be considered down the
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
line because
 
01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:23.750 align:start position:0%
line because
um

01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
I think there are going to be many
 
01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
solutions to this problem that are going
 
01:42:29.629 --> 01:42:29.639 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:42:31.370 --> 01:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
an anathema is that the way you
 
01:42:32.590 --> 01:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
pronounce the word
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
to various parties
 
01:42:38.689 --> 01:42:38.699 align:start position:0%
um and um but I hope that that in the
 
01:42:41.090 --> 01:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
end will not be an excuse for all of us
 
01:42:42.770 --> 01:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
in the state to just sit by and do
 
01:42:45.950 --> 01:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
nothing so I would um be in favor of
 
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
voting against itl and retaining the
 
01:42:51.770 --> 01:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
bill in our committee and it will either
 
01:42:54.590 --> 01:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
come back to our committee or this other
 
01:42:58.990 --> 01:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you representative
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um and and I respect
 
01:43:08.450 --> 01:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
uh the the everybody's comment so far
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
and if I thought that you know what
 
01:43:13.970 --> 01:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy was speaking would
 
01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
would come to pass
 
01:43:18.590 --> 01:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
um I think I would be in favor of
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
retaining but you know I live in
 
01:43:24.290 --> 01:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
Manchester we are in we're the Nexus of
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
a housing crisis a mental health crisis
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
um an opioid crisis and so when I look
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
at these bills coming in my mind I have
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to draw a trajectory because
 
01:43:39.410 --> 01:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
money is precious I had to be able to
 
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
draw that trajectory between where it is
 
01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
to what the conclusion is going to be
 
01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
and I think even from the discussion we
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
have here we're saying yeah we don't
 
01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
really think this is going to be it but
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
let's kind of leave that door open but I
 
01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
think I don't see how this particular
 
01:43:59.689 --> 01:43:59.699 align:start position:0%
structure could achieve the goal unless
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
you put a huge amount of money to it and
 
01:44:06.530 --> 01:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
I think that the special committee on
 
01:44:08.810 --> 01:44:08.820 align:start position:0%
Child Care can come up with a whole
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
bunch of other options that aren't
 
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
basically necessarily this structure and
 
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to have lots of
 
01:44:17.330 --> 01:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
other options that we're going to be
 
01:44:19.609 --> 01:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
able to choose from lots of other arrows
 
01:44:21.169 --> 01:44:21.179 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have in the quiver
 
01:44:23.570 --> 01:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
but this particular structure I don't
 
01:44:26.990 --> 01:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
see how it works unless you put a huge
 
01:44:29.209 --> 01:44:29.219 align:start position:0%
amount of extra money to it and so I'm
 
01:44:32.689 --> 01:44:32.699 align:start position:0%
going to allow the itl motion to stand
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
any other discussion
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing none uh at there's obviously
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
been the extensive amount of debate on
 
01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
this as as would be appropriate it's an
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
important issue I would like to take a
 
01:44:46.370 --> 01:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
five minute recess and ask the
 
01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
Republican members to join me in the
 
01:44:51.709 --> 01:44:51.719 align:start position:0%
back uh office for just a few minutes uh
 
01:44:54.890 --> 01:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
maybe we can have a bit of a little more
 
01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
limited discussion on this so give us
 
01:44:59.530 --> 01:44:59.540 align:start position:0%
five minutes please
 
01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:01.430 align:start position:0%
five minutes please

we've concluded debate at this point on
 
01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:31.370 align:start position:0%
we've concluded debate at this point on

566.
 
01:52:33.890 --> 01:52:33.900 align:start position:0%

okay and again this would not go on the
 
01:55:30.350 --> 01:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
calendar and would not be acted on by
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
the house and we'll we consider it in
 
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:39.229 --> 01:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
okay moving on uh House Bill 565
 
01:55:41.629 --> 01:55:41.639 align:start position:0%
relative to expanding Medicaid to
 
01:55:43.490 --> 01:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
include certain postpartum Health Care
 
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
Services I believe representative Weber
 
01:55:56.270 --> 01:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:04.609 --> 01:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
give two of these to the clerk of one
 
01:56:07.070 --> 01:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
for me and then I'll send them around is
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:18.109 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
I'll just wait for a minute should I Mr
 
01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
chair for those to go around sure that's
 
01:56:25.390 --> 01:56:25.400 align:start position:0%
fine that's fine it's it's not a very
 
01:56:28.609 --> 01:56:28.619 align:start position:0%
extraordinary Amendment the only thing I
 
01:56:31.850 --> 01:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
did in the amendment was on the first
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
and second line of the text of the bill
 
01:56:38.450 --> 01:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
um I changed the reference
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
from whatever the act before this was to
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
the current act which is the
 
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023
 
01:56:49.790 --> 01:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
rather than the whatever it was Act of
 
01:57:03.050 --> 01:57:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:04.669 --> 01:57:04.679 align:start position:0%
so that's the that's the sum and
 
01:57:06.169 --> 01:57:06.179 align:start position:0%
substance that's the sum and substance
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's it it really does
 
01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
um because section one of the bill was
 
01:57:13.370 --> 01:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
everything except the enacting Clause I
 
01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
think anyway the amendment is uh number
 
01:57:21.770 --> 01:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
zero two nine three h and as I said all
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
it does is is correct the current
 
01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
legislation and no further Corrections
 
01:57:33.410 --> 01:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
were needed in the 42 USC 1396 AE
 
01:57:35.330 --> 01:57:35.340 align:start position:0%
because it's all still in the same place
 
01:57:39.010 --> 01:57:39.020 align:start position:0%
it just came from a different Source now
 
01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:40.609 align:start position:0%
it just came from a different Source now
so

01:57:40.609 --> 01:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
um with that I would I would move
 
01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:46.370 align:start position:0%
um with that I would I would move
Representatives

01:57:46.370 --> 01:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it's it's late and we're all
 
01:57:51.530 --> 01:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
tired or it's early and we're all tired
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
um I would move the adoption of
 
01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:58.270 align:start position:0%
um I would move the adoption of
amendment

01:57:58.270 --> 01:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:00.129 align:start position:0%
 
20230293h

01:58:00.129 --> 01:58:00.139 align:start position:0%
20230293h
 
01:58:02.990 --> 01:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
because it corrects the technicality in
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you is there a second
 
01:58:08.209 --> 01:58:08.219 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:58:11.930 --> 01:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
uh not a problem thank you
 
01:58:17.209 --> 01:58:17.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:19.490 --> 01:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
01:58:22.729 --> 01:58:22.739 align:start position:0%
chairman I have a question on this um in
 
01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill there's a section
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
one that is the title and this is
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
actually section two
 
01:58:32.089 --> 01:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
um so it's it has section two
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to section one so it's
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
inserting it and correcting it in the
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
wrong one I'm sorry I just looked at
 
01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
that when I was trying to do my homework
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
on the bill and make sure what we had
 
01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
was correct let me pull up the bill and
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
see if I can answer that
 
01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:51.169 align:start position:0%
see if I can answer that
um

01:58:51.169 --> 01:58:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:53.629 --> 01:58:53.639 align:start position:0%
although to provide commentary we did
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
learn during House Bill 430 last year
 
01:58:57.770 --> 01:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
that there is some ability to do
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
something like just change that it'll be
 
01:59:01.129 --> 01:59:01.139 align:start position:0%
section two and then we can just confirm
 
01:59:03.229 --> 01:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
that were we to change that wording to
 
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill that we would be
 
01:59:13.570 --> 01:59:13.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:16.609 --> 01:59:16.619 align:start position:0%
yes so when you look at the amendment it
 
01:59:19.729 --> 01:59:19.739 align:start position:0%
says amend the RSA as inserted by
 
01:59:21.589 --> 01:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill by replacing it
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
with the following so what that does um
 
01:59:25.370 --> 01:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
just technically looking at the bill
 
01:59:27.550 --> 01:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
that would take lines
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
it's intended to take lines five through
 
01:59:32.330 --> 01:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
fifteen and replace them with this
 
01:59:34.609 --> 01:59:34.619 align:start position:0%
section the problem is that's actually
 
01:59:37.490 --> 01:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
section two not section one that's one
 
01:59:38.689 --> 01:59:38.699 align:start position:0%
of those things that was easy to
 
01:59:40.669 --> 01:59:40.679 align:start position:0%
overlook but we want to make sure that
 
01:59:43.010 --> 01:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
it is in fact correct
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
um I think we I think that's something
 
01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
where we would be able to correct that
 
01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:49.550 align:start position:0%
where we would be able to correct that
or

01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to get that actually
 
01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:52.850 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to get that actually
correct

01:59:52.850 --> 01:59:52.860 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:59:55.070 --> 01:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
if it's the pleasure of the committee I
 
01:59:57.229 --> 01:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
would be perfectly happy to go back to
 
01:59:57.239 --> 01:59:58.370 align:start position:0%
would be perfectly happy to go back to
OLS

01:59:58.370 --> 01:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
OLS
 
01:59:58.380 --> 01:59:59.050 align:start position:0%
OLS
um

01:59:59.050 --> 01:59:59.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
I thought I was handing them a very
 
02:00:02.159 --> 02:00:03.490 align:start position:0%
I thought I was handing them a very
simple

02:00:03.490 --> 02:00:03.500 align:start position:0%
simple
 
02:00:06.530 --> 02:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
Amendment one of the more simple
 
02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon and I thought that
 
02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
was giving them a great deal of time and
 
02:00:15.530 --> 02:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
leeway and I was looked at with horror
 
02:00:17.330 --> 02:00:17.340 align:start position:0%
when I was told that it had to be done
 
02:00:20.510 --> 02:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
by one o'clock today so
 
02:00:23.089 --> 02:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
um I'd be more than happy to take it
 
02:00:25.729 --> 02:00:25.739 align:start position:0%
back and check it with them just to be
 
02:00:27.169 --> 02:00:27.179 align:start position:0%
sure we've got
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
our ducks in a row
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:36.770 --> 02:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
because I would love to be able to say
 
02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
gee this is the sort of thing we can fix
 
02:00:41.089 --> 02:00:41.099 align:start position:0%
between now and the floor but I'd rather
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
not have to do it as a floor Amendment
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
and all the rest of it
 
02:00:46.729 --> 02:00:46.739 align:start position:0%
so you'd would it be a pleasure
 
02:00:48.770 --> 02:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
representative that we recess this bill
 
02:00:52.129 --> 02:00:52.139 align:start position:0%
also or I'll withdraw my motion and if
 
02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
you would put it on again for next week
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
that would be grand okay
 
02:01:00.649 --> 02:01:00.659 align:start position:0%
all right so we will be recessing HB 565
 
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
along continuing that along with the
 
02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:06.530 align:start position:0%
along continuing that along with the
others

02:01:06.530 --> 02:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:09.300 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry uh representative Nutter
 
02:01:11.450 --> 02:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
Upham would you join me in
 
02:01:14.510 --> 02:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay so we will continue that uh to next
 
02:01:20.570 --> 02:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
week also and this brings us to what I
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
believe was our last build for
 
02:01:24.589 --> 02:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
consideration this afternoon which is HP
 
02:01:29.030 --> 02:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
580. and um representative Merchant you
 
02:01:33.310 --> 02:01:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:35.810 --> 02:01:35.820 align:start position:0%
yes I'd like to make a motion to retain
 
02:01:37.250 --> 02:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
the bill please
 
02:01:38.890 --> 02:01:38.900 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
02:01:43.609 --> 02:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on the motion or
 
02:01:46.490 --> 02:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
02:01:48.589 --> 02:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
02:01:50.209 --> 02:01:50.219 align:start position:0%
Mr chair that was seconded by
 
02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer oh I'm sorry okay
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
I had you down representative McLean
 
02:01:56.149 --> 02:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm putting my hand in his in his
 
02:01:58.010 --> 02:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
representative space representative
 
02:01:59.689 --> 02:01:59.699 align:start position:0%
Fishman is out of the womb she'll be
 
02:02:01.330 --> 02:02:01.340 align:start position:0%
right back she got some maternal
 
02:02:04.070 --> 02:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to fulfill
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
but but certainly representative
 
02:02:07.070 --> 02:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
Merchant if you want to speak to you
 
02:02:10.070 --> 02:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
mostly sure thank you but I I totally
 
02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
support the intent of this bill
 
02:02:15.050 --> 02:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
um what I am struggling with though is
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that were raised by
 
02:02:20.510 --> 02:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
some of the folks regarding the bill
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
and part of this is looking for is the
 
02:02:24.830 --> 02:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
basic screening
 
02:02:27.050 --> 02:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
what I'm reading into this is that it
 
02:02:28.850 --> 02:02:28.860 align:start position:0%
appears to be a reimbursement issue
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
about the screening Itself by licensed
 
02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:32.629 align:start position:0%
about the screening Itself by licensed
providers

02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
providers
 
02:02:35.209 --> 02:02:35.219 align:start position:0%
and I don't think I was per se maybe the
 
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
intent of it but I'd like to retain this
 
02:02:38.089 --> 02:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
to have a little more discussion with
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
the ophthalmologist and the optometrist
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
and other people including School nurses
 
02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
to find out what can and cannot be done
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
if the school nurses or schools are
 
02:02:48.530 --> 02:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
actually doing a lot of the screening
 
02:02:51.470 --> 02:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
maybe this is redundancy so I'd like to
 
02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
have that kind of a conversation with
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders and have a little more
 
02:02:57.290 --> 02:02:57.300 align:start position:0%
robust understanding of what's going on
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
and bring it back to the committee with
 
02:03:00.770 --> 02:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
the recommendation
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh
 
02:03:05.149 --> 02:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
02:03:05.159 --> 02:03:05.990 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
um

02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
my concern with the more the discussion
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
than the actual bill was
 
02:03:14.589 --> 02:03:14.599 align:start position:0%
we're really not focusing on school
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're fo and that's why I tried to bring
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
up the point of points of access
 
02:03:21.050 --> 02:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
you want to hit a lot of these visual
 
02:03:23.870 --> 02:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
things from zero to three not five and
 
02:03:25.609 --> 02:03:25.619 align:start position:0%
Beyond when they're actually in school
 
02:03:28.729 --> 02:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
and I I was really concerned that the
 
02:03:30.649 --> 02:03:30.659 align:start position:0%
focus on the bill was getting at school
 
02:03:32.089 --> 02:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
nurses and this and that and the other
 
02:03:33.890 --> 02:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
people you really need to be focusing on
 
02:03:36.050 --> 02:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
well baby checks early Child Development
 
02:03:38.030 --> 02:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
things like that and I really think
 
02:03:39.890 --> 02:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
that's what needs to be emphasized in
 
02:03:41.330 --> 02:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
representative nego I agree with you 100
 
02:03:45.770 --> 02:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
the other thing which I brought up
 
02:03:48.290 --> 02:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
during the testimony this really does
 
02:03:50.209 --> 02:03:50.219 align:start position:0%
what deals with a subset of the
 
02:03:52.490 --> 02:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
population which is Medicaid and I like
 
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
to look at it more broadly because the
 
02:03:56.810 --> 02:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
disease itself is unlimited to Medicaid
 
02:03:58.910 --> 02:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
children so I think we need to look at
 
02:04:01.609 --> 02:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
it holistically and look at it broadly
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
oh the discussion
 
02:04:06.239 --> 02:04:08.209 align:start position:0%
oh the discussion
representative

02:04:08.209 --> 02:04:08.219 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
this is really just I just wondered um
 
02:04:12.890 --> 02:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
some of you were parents that had
 
02:04:15.290 --> 02:04:15.300 align:start position:0%
children in public school systems did
 
02:04:16.810 --> 02:04:16.820 align:start position:0%
your children get
 
02:04:20.030 --> 02:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
vision screening I live in the city of
 
02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
Nashua we have a strong Lions Club I
 
02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
helped raise money for their machines
 
02:04:27.290 --> 02:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
and things and and one of my children
 
02:04:30.290 --> 02:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
who I took yearly to their all of my
 
02:04:31.550 --> 02:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
children I took yearly to their
 
02:04:34.669 --> 02:04:34.679 align:start position:0%
physicals daughter number two failed her
 
02:04:36.169 --> 02:04:36.179 align:start position:0%
eye exam and I'm like well how about
 
02:04:37.609 --> 02:04:37.619 align:start position:0%
that I'm glad they had the school
 
02:04:40.010 --> 02:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
screening and took her and she wears
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
glasses so I just wondered what other
 
02:04:44.930 --> 02:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
people's experience with their kids were
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
like really briefly and I agree with a
 
02:04:50.209 --> 02:04:50.219 align:start position:0%
further look and to get the younger kids
 
02:04:53.629 --> 02:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
in as we heard from testimony
 
02:04:55.250 --> 02:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
another discussion
 
02:04:57.169 --> 02:04:57.179 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
02:04:59.870 --> 02:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
I think there was also some
 
02:05:02.570 --> 02:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
testimony that I read that wasn't
 
02:05:04.550 --> 02:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
presented the other day from
 
02:05:06.530 --> 02:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
Ophthalmology and Optometry and they
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
have concerns about actual inappropriate
 
02:05:11.689 --> 02:05:11.699 align:start position:0%
referrals so they were work their
 
02:05:14.450 --> 02:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
concern was worrying that they all of a
 
02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
sudden we're going to get flooded with
 
02:05:19.490 --> 02:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
requests to have more comprehensive
 
02:05:21.050 --> 02:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
exams and they would like to make sure
 
02:05:24.050 --> 02:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
that that whatever Bill gets crafted
 
02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that they that the referrals
 
02:05:28.010 --> 02:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
are appropriate
 
02:05:29.810 --> 02:05:29.820 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
02:05:31.850 --> 02:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um I can speak
 
02:05:33.830 --> 02:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
partly from the point of a parent of
 
02:05:34.970 --> 02:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
young children
 
02:05:36.830 --> 02:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
um we actually did the we take care of
 
02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
all of this stuff through our own
 
02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:39.530 align:start position:0%
all of this stuff through our own
routine

02:05:39.530 --> 02:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
routine
 
02:05:40.850 --> 02:05:40.860 align:start position:0%
um care it's not something where we're
 
02:05:42.589 --> 02:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
looking to any screening programs and we
 
02:05:43.790 --> 02:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
haven't been caught up in these
 
02:05:45.169 --> 02:05:45.179 align:start position:0%
screening programs but we also
 
02:05:49.609 --> 02:05:49.619 align:start position:0%
homeschool so um that's that's one where
 
02:05:53.290 --> 02:05:53.300 align:start position:0%
no we do it's nurse mom
 
02:05:56.089 --> 02:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
but that's also in in those situations
 
02:05:58.129 --> 02:05:58.139 align:start position:0%
you you are noticing that if there is
 
02:06:00.229 --> 02:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
something with where they're looking at
 
02:06:02.450 --> 02:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
it funny you see that because you're
 
02:06:04.910 --> 02:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
watching that whole development and it's
 
02:06:06.290 --> 02:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
not to say that other parents aren't
 
02:06:08.089 --> 02:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
necessarily looking for that but when
 
02:06:09.970 --> 02:06:09.980 align:start position:0%
you've taken on that responsibility
 
02:06:12.649 --> 02:06:12.659 align:start position:0%
you're you're looking at if they're
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
moving their hand in a particular way
 
02:06:16.250 --> 02:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
you're you're over analyzing your
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
children without letting them know so
 
02:06:20.450 --> 02:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
there is that Focus to it and then also
 
02:06:22.970 --> 02:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
looking to the issue of specificity and
 
02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
sensitivity of the diagnostic test
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
there's that problem if you catch too
 
02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
many false positives it's worse than no
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
test so I I think that our attention is
 
02:06:34.430 --> 02:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
is wonderful for this
 
02:06:37.729 --> 02:06:37.739 align:start position:0%
okay representative Nagel one of the I
 
02:06:39.649 --> 02:06:39.659 align:start position:0%
didn't want this to get lost in all the
 
02:06:40.970 --> 02:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
discussion but there was written
 
02:06:42.770 --> 02:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
testimony that was given that was not
 
02:06:44.689 --> 02:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
stated there but this so probably 40
 
02:06:46.669 --> 02:06:46.679 align:start position:0%
percent of children
 
02:06:49.490 --> 02:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
do not have a visual screen before age
 
02:06:52.370 --> 02:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
four and and that was really concerning
 
02:06:53.930 --> 02:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I want to point out
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
too is that there are models of care out
 
02:06:57.830 --> 02:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
there and head injury which is my other
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
big interest I mean we have most people
 
02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
doing post-concussive screens are not
 
02:07:04.729 --> 02:07:04.739 align:start position:0%
doctors they're doing it on young
 
02:07:06.530 --> 02:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
athletes things like that you can use
 
02:07:08.810 --> 02:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
that same model to avoid what you're
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
talking about representative Palm or
 
02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
these inappropriate referrals these
 
02:07:14.089 --> 02:07:14.099 align:start position:0%
screens don't need you don't need a lot
 
02:07:15.890 --> 02:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
of Education to do them
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that was me pontificating of
 
02:07:20.570 --> 02:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
the discussion
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative that's right yeah
 
02:07:26.510 --> 02:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so uh
 
02:07:28.609 --> 02:07:28.619 align:start position:0%
a couple things one is I guess when I
 
02:07:30.589 --> 02:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
originally uh when we were hearing about
 
02:07:33.350 --> 02:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
it I envisioned the you take your child
 
02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
to the world child check the medical
 
02:07:37.609 --> 02:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
assistant has them stand 20 feet away
 
02:07:39.709 --> 02:07:39.719 align:start position:0%
from the chart on the door and that's
 
02:07:40.850 --> 02:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
the kind of screening we're talking
 
02:07:43.729 --> 02:07:43.739 align:start position:0%
about this does include vision screening
 
02:07:45.709 --> 02:07:45.719 align:start position:0%
of pupils
 
02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
um and so you know
 
02:07:49.790 --> 02:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it actually intends to
 
02:07:51.470 --> 02:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
be more than just someone looks in the
 
02:07:54.830 --> 02:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
eye with an ophthalmoscope and then
 
02:07:56.810 --> 02:07:56.820 align:start position:0%
additional vision screening and then I I
 
02:07:59.209 --> 02:07:59.219 align:start position:0%
also I think what this is tickling for
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
me is something analogous to the program
 
02:08:04.370 --> 02:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
I raised yesterday which is there is
 
02:08:07.010 --> 02:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
universal screening of all babies
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
um and a whole system set up uh you know
 
02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:13.679 align:start position:0%
at a national and and state levels to
 
02:08:15.770 --> 02:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
try to identify hearing loss in children
 
02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
which is a significant problem you know
 
02:08:21.169 --> 02:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
early enough that they can be intervened
 
02:08:25.010 --> 02:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
in a timely fashion and so I agree that
 
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
there's some you know if we really want
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure that all children are being
 
02:08:31.010 --> 02:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
screened appropriately then it shouldn't
 
02:08:33.649 --> 02:08:33.659 align:start position:0%
just be limited to Medicaid
 
02:08:35.510 --> 02:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
um and so whatever it's raising a lot of
 
02:08:37.550 --> 02:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
different issues for me
 
02:08:39.770 --> 02:08:39.780 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
I see no other hands up am I missing
 
02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:47.930 align:start position:0%
I see no other hands up am I missing
anyone

02:08:47.930 --> 02:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
02:08:49.910 --> 02:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay I'll ask the collector column
 
02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
motion is to retain on high school I'm
 
02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:53.450 align:start position:0%
motion is to retain on high school I'm
sorry

02:08:53.450 --> 02:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:08:55.550 --> 02:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
point of order am I yes am I allowed to
 
02:08:57.709 --> 02:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
vote on this okay thank you
 
02:08:59.209 --> 02:08:59.219 align:start position:0%
yeah so if you were here when the
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
question was put so just so everybody
 
02:09:06.350 --> 02:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
knows until he says the question is you
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to be here for all of the all
 
02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:10.619 align:start position:0%
of the discussion and there will not be
 
02:09:12.770 --> 02:09:12.780 align:start position:0%
a quiz afterwards
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's just if if we start if if he had
 
02:09:17.149 --> 02:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
already started and the clerk had
 
02:09:19.609 --> 02:09:19.619 align:start position:0%
started to call the role you can't then
 
02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
come in and say oh by the way
 
02:09:24.169 --> 02:09:24.179 align:start position:0%

I would like to work with some of my
 
02:11:15.890 --> 02:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
peers on this committee
 
02:11:18.589 --> 02:11:18.599 align:start position:0%
to talk about what we could do to
 
02:11:20.750 --> 02:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
correct the bill to make it
 
02:11:23.629 --> 02:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
more palatable to all as many of the
 
02:11:25.189 --> 02:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
people in the committee as possible so
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%

and a wonderful role model
 
02:12:58.430 --> 02:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant just the point
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
of clarification in regards to this had
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
hot group on rep on House Bill 397.
 
02:13:07.310 --> 02:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
is it permissible to do this via Zoom or
 
02:13:08.810 --> 02:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
do we have to schedule it or have a
 
02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
public hearing with it can we just meet
 
02:13:12.530 --> 02:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves via Zoom
 
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
but thank you just it's like an ad hoc
 
02:13:17.629 --> 02:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
group right so it's it is not an
 
02:13:19.790 --> 02:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
official subcommittee if it was an
 
02:13:22.010 --> 02:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
official subcommittee appointed by the
 
02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:22.970 align:start position:0%
official subcommittee appointed by the
chair

02:13:22.970 --> 02:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:13:26.330 --> 02:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
which would be preferable but
 
02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
time is what time is
 
02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:30.890 align:start position:0%
time is what time is
uh

02:13:30.890 --> 02:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:33.169 --> 02:13:33.179 align:start position:0%
then it would have to be noticed in the
 
02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
calendar it would have to be in person
 
02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
it would have to be here if it is not a
 
02:13:40.669 --> 02:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
quorum of the committee
 
02:13:43.970 --> 02:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
or of a subcommittee then you can talk
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
to whoever you want to and you can meet
 
02:13:47.450 --> 02:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
wherever you want to there is no
 
02:13:49.569 --> 02:13:49.579 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so
 
02:13:52.970 --> 02:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
up to 11 people can meet
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
under any circumstances that they want
 
02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
to talk to each other about without
 
02:13:56.760 --> 02:13:58.310 align:start position:0%
to talk to each other about without
creating

02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
creating
 
02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
but 11 people can't so 10 or under it's
 
02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
an informal group in other words so in
 
02:14:06.350 --> 02:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
saying that if I could meet with
 
02:14:08.750 --> 02:14:08.760 align:start position:0%

02:14:10.490 --> 02:14:10.500 align:start position:0%

02:14:12.589 --> 02:14:12.599 align:start position:0%
