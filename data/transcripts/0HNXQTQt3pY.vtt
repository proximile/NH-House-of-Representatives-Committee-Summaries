solid waste site evaluation committee
 
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
and I'd like the committee to take some
 
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 align:start position:0%
time to review this so that we can
 
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 align:start position:0%

electronically um and you may have
 
00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 align:start position:0%
reviewed it already but I did want to
 
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that everybody got a hard copy
 
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to pass that around each
 
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
go um and it's going to be important for
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
us to discuss this as a committee
 
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
because I know that Finance where the
 
00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 align:start position:0%
hb2 trailer bill is right now will be
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
looking for our input as to our
 
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh regarding uh this
 
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
language that's in
 
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
there and I also know that uh some of
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
and so this goes from page
 
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
14 to page 24 I
 
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
believe yes um so that that particular
 
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
section I'd like us to uh pay particular
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
attention to I know that some of this
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
what what they're proposing may already
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
be in some some shape or way shape or
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
form uh in bills that we are have
 
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 align:start position:0%

today uh and we can uh
 
00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
certainly um you know at some point
 
00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 align:start position:0%
there may be a committee conference to
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%

when we come back from school vacation
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%

00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%

sorry so on our uh full committee work
session

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
sheet the first item that I wanted to
 
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
discuss with you all was
 
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
hb150 and I believe representative ktoa
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
has an amendment to that that she'd like
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
to explain to
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
us thank thank you madam chair um during
 
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
the presentation it came to our
 
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
attention that we didn't use the word
 
00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959 align:start position:0%
sanitize and that was extremely
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
important in making sure uh that anytime
 
00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:13.959 align:start position:0%
we're processing food we're sanitizing
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
equipment so uh the change was instead
 
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
of saying uh washed and rinsed is uh was
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
changed to to be cleaned and sanitized
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
in the processing area it's just a a
 
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
real simple change uh and everybody I
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
put this in front on everyone's desk so
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
they could uh take a look at that
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
otherwi that was the only change that
 
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.389 align:start position:0%
otherwi that was the only change that
was

00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
made okay represent vix um I think this
 
00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:40.519 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense I think it's a a
 
00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
lot is both more consistent with food
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
safety practice and um I think that uh
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
yes so I think that it makes more sense
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of how people would actually do
 
00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
things okay yeah I uh I absolutely think
 
00:09:59.470 --> 00:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
this is an improvement and I have no
 
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
problem with this amendment and I will
 
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
be looking forward to supporting it when
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
we go into exec session uh to get this
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
uh bill passed
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
hb150 any other questions or comments
 
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.750 align:start position:0%
hb150 any other questions or comments
regarding

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
hb150 okay thank you um moving along we
 
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
have HB 307 relative to food production
 
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
area for Homestead
 
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
food um I know that we when after we
 
00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:32.839 align:start position:0%
heard the
 
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
bill uh we had some thoughts that we
 
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
might execute right away but I know that
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
representative King had some reservation
 
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh look at some of the
 
00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:46.519 align:start position:0%
statutes that it was referring to um but
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
I think um there was also some thought
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
about making some amendment to it
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby do you yes so um uh so
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
um Addie whose last name I'm blanking on
 
00:11:08.629 --> 00:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
right now but it's probably on the sheet
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
here uh leader zavos yes um uh um sent a
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
sent uh a I'm not sure if she sent it to
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
the full committee or just to me but a
 
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
uh a proposed um some proposed amendment
 
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
language and uh I think that a lot of it
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
makes sense so um I think that uh this
 
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
is one that we should take a little time
 
00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:36.279 align:start position:0%
to um look over and um and do an
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
amendment for uh our next uh session uh
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
as opposed to um executing it today so
 
00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:49.870 align:start position:0%
uh and
the

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
um what the what her language
 
00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
essentially does is it uh lays out some
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
clearer uh um requirements for what that
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
second what a secondary food production
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
area would need to be able to uh what
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
would what would qualify an area for
 
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
that and uh so um accessibility to
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
handwashing which is really key for any
 
00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:22.519 align:start position:0%
sort of food production um and equipment
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
and food storage so um making sure the
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
area has to uh allow for
 
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
uh sanitary um uh storage of food
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
equipment and utensils uh the area needs
 
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
to have food um have Food Services food
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
contact surfaces that are
 
00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
sanitizable uh
 
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
and uh which is really key for
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
maintaining proper sanitation in uh in a
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
food production area uh and uh it also
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
has to be the whole area needs to be
 
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
uh maintain maintainable in a clean and
 
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:06.839 align:start position:0%
S sanitary uh condition free from PES
 
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
and environmental contaminants and it
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
needs to allow for pet
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
exclusion uh and I think that's um
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
that's also an important uh aspect of it
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
and I think it might that might imp fact
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
make the area better than the average
 
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
home kitchen because uh sometimes pet
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
exclusion is a little challenging for
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
home kitchen
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh but uh although that is in fact
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
required under current uh rules for you
 
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:37.160 align:start position:0%
when you are working in your home
 
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
kitchen you need to exclude pets um so I
 
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
think all of those elements of of the uh
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
of what she's suggesting makes sense uh
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
I'm she's also suggested uh changing the
 
00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:53.759 align:start position:0%
word poten potentially hazardous food
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
for time temperature control safe
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
control for safety food for food safety
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh and that
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
um the uh I'm cons a little bit
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
concerned about that because there are
 
00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:10.839 align:start position:0%
some potentially ha hazardous foods
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
where the issue is not the time temp
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
temperature control uh and I think
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
partic particularly of uh canned items
 
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
uh low acid canned items are not uh an
 
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
time uh time temperature control is not
 
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
the issue with low acid items uh it is
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
in fact you know that it's just that if
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
you don't uh use a pressure caner with
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
those and have your pressure caner
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
properly properly calibrated uh it can
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
allow for uh the introduction of
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
botulism which is an incredibly
 
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
poisonous back um contaminant so um I
 
00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
think that the we probably want to stick
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
with the potentially hazardous food
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
since that is reasonably well defined
 
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
already in
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
um in uh in our food safety
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
laws okay thank you um and I I
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely appreciate um these comments
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
that were submitted to the committee wi
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
with regard to proposed revisions for
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
hp37 I think they really are
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and take into account a
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
lot of the open issues that were that
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
were voiced when we had the hearing uh
 
00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:29.959 align:start position:0%
well done thank you so much for that
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa thank you madam
 
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
chair uh representative Bixby will you
 
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
be bringing forth the amendment yes I'll
 
00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
uh get it drafted for our next for our
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
um the executive session that happens
 
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:44.759 align:start position:0%
after school break so I think that's the
 
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
March 4th March 4th yes so um this
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
afternoon because it's on our exec list

479 um we we had wanted to execute right
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
away and we didn't have we wanted to itl
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
the bill and uh representative Penza was
 
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
going to draft a letter to the solid
 
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:29.480 align:start position:0%

schedule this morning and uh hopefully
 
00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:45.079 align:start position:0%
we can uh exec the bill uh later this
 
00:16:48.189 --> 00:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
morning um representative Penza did you
 
00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:51.399 align:start position:0%

you're looking for help we're looking
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
that yep but um so we the plan is then
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
to um itl that study committee bill
 
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
um in our exec session or later this
 
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
morning okay moving to
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
hb77 requiring the Department of
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services to establish a
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
site specific setback distance for
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
proposed new
 
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
landfills and I believe representative
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
Penza you were working on an amendment
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
to that I don't believe that amendment
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
is ready for today no no no it's not
 
00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
it's um it's very close though so I
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
could probably I don't I don't have a
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
draft from OS but I could give you like
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
my draft if we wanted to do that I could
 
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
send it up to have printed um I have
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
that on the list of exec bills on March
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
4th okay so and we will have a a chance
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh to further discuss that um tomorrow
 
00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:21.799 align:start position:0%
um or if you want to further discuss
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
that today um we could definitely
 
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
further discuss it tomorrow um I'll have
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
I'll have a draft of what um but not
 
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
from OS but a draft of the changes that
 
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
we've discussed or like in open in the
 
00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
hearing and stuff for everyone so they
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
can super representative Bixby yeah so I
 
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you had um uh worked on
 
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
including language for that um in terms
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
handled I have not touched anything with
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
Le okay so um so that that um uh I I
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
don't think that we need to so one of
 
00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
the an issue came up or uh in our
 
00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
discussion of the leech a bill last week
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know whether uh whether
 
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
the area at a um at a landfill where
 
00:19:18.149 --> 00:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
lee8 is stored and
 
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:20.919 align:start position:0%
transferred uh is required to be
 
00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:24.919 align:start position:0%
under uh to to have a uh double whining
 
00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
underneath it to catch any potential
 
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
spills and
 
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh the answer from that we got from
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh Mike whims at did say that he did
 
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
say that that is part of the you know
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
assessing the uh the area where leate is
 
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
handled and stored is part of the review
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
process but he but he did not say that
 
00:19:50.149 --> 00:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
it is that there is a double lining
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
required underneath that and um that
 
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
might be something that we want to add
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
to the set to to 707 uh in order to make
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
sure that we do in fact have you know
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
every potential spillage um area covered
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
by the bill yeah I think it's a
 
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
fantastic idea I just
 
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
um can that be implemented in in such a
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
way that because this is basically
 
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
updating rules you know the 800 rules so
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
can that be implemented in my bill in
 
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
such a way that um it could be just you
 
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
know four or five lines and not like
 
00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:33.799 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying to get into a
 
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
real big long explanation that's what I
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
think that's the only piece that I was
 
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.310 align:start position:0%
think that's the only piece that I was
concerned

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
with representative germana thank you
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh yeah I'm I'm hap very
 
00:20:48.669 --> 00:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
happy to work with repr representative
 
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
pateno we had a preliminary conversation
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
because we had decided that 77 was
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
probably more appropriate because it's
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
about operations as opposed to 2115
 
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:00.919 align:start position:0%
which is about about the plan uh and I
 
00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
do think it's something we could
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
probably do in three lines so I'm very
 
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
happy to work with representative prends
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
on that language yep that sounds like a
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
really good plan
 
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.830 align:start position:0%
really good plan
yep

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh let me just make my
 
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:17.860 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh let me just make my
note

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:17.870 align:start position:0%
note
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:25.190 align:start position:0%
note
[Music]

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
all right uh now moving on to any other
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
questions or comments about that one 707
 
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
no okay thank you for that um moving on
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
hr10 which is uh recognizing the
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
fundamental right to have clean air
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
clean water and a healthy environment as
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
a house resolution um I did present an
 
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the committee uh last
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
week and I hope that you reviewed it and
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
and um I plan to move that um when we do
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
exec session this morning representative
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah I think that I'm um I I still
 
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
prefer the language that uses rights but
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
uh I'm but in terms of you know the
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
final disposition of the bill coming out
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
of committee I'm uh I think that uh
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's amended I think it
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
makes sense just um to pass to pass it
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
so um I think that uh we'll we'll see
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
that we we'll deal with that when it
 
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
comes to the executive session okay
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate that all right any
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments regarding
 
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
that okay HB
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
2115 requiring a landfill permit
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
applicant to submit a report listing
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
potential harms and benefits of the
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
project that is an early Bill we really
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
should um have that done today so um I
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
believe representative gero was working
 
00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
on that and as I see we have an
 
00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.909 align:start position:0%
on that and as I see we have an
amendment

00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:00.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
amendment I would thank you very much
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
Madam chair so this uh is uh a
 
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
combination of discussions that uh
 
00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
ongoing discussions that I have had with
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
director whim sad and also from work
 
00:23:18.669 --> 00:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
session and our Solid Waste subcommittee
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh and so uh one note that I would make
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
is that the amendment that you're
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
looking at here replaces section one in
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
the bill as introduced
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
sections two through
 
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
five remain as they are in the
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
introduced version this is just how OS
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
prints out the amendment they don't
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
replace the whole bill um but this
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
section was the one where we spelled out
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
some of the details around the defining
 
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
n public benefit and a process for
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
determining for example how an
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
independent third party would be
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
contracted and so uh as you can see
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
originally a b and c
 
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
are already in
 
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
statute the original Bill had just one
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
more provision that was D but working
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
with director whims we have fleshed out
 
00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
in section d uh for example how the
 
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
third party would be contracted in this
 
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
case U an applicant would submit a list
 
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.310 align:start position:0%
case U an applicant would submit a list
of

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559 align:start position:0%
third-party uh reviewers to Dees Dees
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
would review that list would work with
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
the applic and the host Community to try
 
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
to identify a mutually acceptable third
 
00:24:37.149 --> 00:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
party if Dees doesn't feel that they
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
have been given adequate if they feel
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
that the list the applicant gave them is
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
really not adequate they can ask for
 
00:24:47.389 --> 00:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
more uh and if uh a mutually um agreed
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
upon party is not found within 60 days
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
the commissioner shall choose based upon
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh the list that they
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
have then section e this is something I
 
00:24:59.549 --> 00:24:59.559 align:start position:0%
I talked to the committee about already
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
uh I think this is a really good
 
00:25:05.389 --> 00:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
addition it uh expands actually the list
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
of potential benefits that can be
 
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
considered to include uh economic
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
potential economic benefits and
 
00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
improvements to infrastructure and the
 
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
purpose here uh and again this came from
 
00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:18.919 align:start position:0%
my conversations with the director uh is
 
00:25:20.909 --> 00:25:20.919 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this is genuinely
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
about finding what that balance is so if
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
we're looking for potential harms to
 
00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:29.799 align:start position:0%
tourism to uh you know the local economy
 
00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
to property values Etc we're also
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
looking at potential benefits so it's
 
00:25:38.389 --> 00:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
creating hopefully a much more balanced
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh list of things on both sides that we
 
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
are are looking at uh and I think that's
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
something actually that
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
industry will appreciate because
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
according to the director they have for
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
years argued that benefits should go
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
beyond simply capacity need so as I said
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
I think this provides a more balanced uh
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
approach to um benefits and and
 
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
potential harms you know one of the
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
concerns that's been raised about some
 
00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
of our bills is the idea that it's about
 
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
saying that nobody can ever site a
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
landfill in the state again and that's
 
00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:11.559 align:start position:0%
not not the case and I think that this
 
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph is a good example of trying to
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
find a place where we are genuinely
 
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
trying to conclude what the ultimate net
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
benefit uh would be to the community and
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
then sections f and g again clarify more
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
regarding the thirdparty assess
 
00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:30.430 align:start position:0%
regarding the thirdparty assess
assessment

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
um section
 
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
F gives Dees the ability to coordinate
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Transportation
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Business and economic
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
Affairs and the Department of Natural
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
and cultural resources to help provide
 
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
expertise in the evaluation of the third
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
party report and that's an initial kind
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
of screening phase uh that is explained
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
in uh section g so uh one of the
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
differences uh actually quite a bit of
 
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
the language from this bill I think is
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
is reflected in the governor's proposal
 
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
on on
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
hb2 the difference here uh and this
 
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
again came out of discussions with the
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
director is that in this bill it is done
 
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
in the beginning there's an initial
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
screening phase for public benefit the
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
idea of the site evaluation committee
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
would actually come toward the end of
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
that process so that's a difference
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
between this bill and that bill um but
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
in this B as section g points out it
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
will be a preliminary stage and only if
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
there is a determination of net public
 
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
benefit would an application then go on
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
to uh further
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
review okay thank you representative
 
00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:46.039 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair and uh thank
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
you representative germana for all the
 
00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:49.519 align:start position:0%
work you put into this uh quick question
 
00:27:49.519 --> 00:27:50.750 align:start position:0%
work you put into this uh quick question
about

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
um uh subsection D um you're talking
 
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
about the um the contractors who are
 
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
going to help the third parties there um
 
00:28:03.389 --> 00:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
what kind of contractors are you
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
thinking of I'm you know originally I
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
was thinking of sort of like NOS or some
 
00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:10.519 align:start position:0%
sort of like um you know sort of public
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
community service kind of organization
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
but when you mean contractors what what
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
is meant by that can you just explain
 
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:19.240 align:start position:0%
who these who these contractors will be
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
what they'll do yes thank you very much
 
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
and that's something that the the
 
00:28:25.389 --> 00:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
director said that they would have to
 
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
kind of familiarize themselves with the
 
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
world he said offand you know there
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
weren't specific say firms that he had
 
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
in mind but they would be uh you know
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
environmental impact statements both at
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
the federal and state level are very
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
very common 16 states have systems that
 
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
require environmental impacts as does
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
the federal government and so there are
 
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
uh organizations they are Environ
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes environmental engineering
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
firms for example who regularly engage
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
in the work of um evaluations for
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
environmental impact statements so uh
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid I can't give you you know the
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
names of specific firms but uh there are
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh environmental engineering firms that
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
do this regularly at the state and
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
federal level okay followup followup
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so it's not necessarily local
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
organizations in that Community it could
 
00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:15.559 align:start position:0%
be larger organizations that are outside
 
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:17.480 align:start position:0%
that Community yes that is correct and I
 
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
and I think that the point of having a
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
list submitted by the applicant and and
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
then Dees is going to review it and you
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
know the purpose is to find a variety
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
right so you know there may be one
 
00:29:30.909 --> 00:29:30.919 align:start position:0%
locally there may be one regionally but
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
it is to provide several different
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
options for everyone involved to
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
consider represent Bixby yeah so um so
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
Adam fle who has been uh many of us are
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
on the committee are familiar with him
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
he's done a lot of uh uh given us a lot
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
of help in terms of figuring out what
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
makes sense in terms of setback
 
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
requirements and a number of other
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
things uh he worked in uh in benefit and
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh cost benefit analysis for the federal
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
government for decades uh and has also
 
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:05.720 align:start position:0%
taught that at the uh at the University
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
level and uh he uh he commented that
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
this is because the federal government
 
00:30:15.389 --> 00:30:15.399 align:start position:0%
uses and a number of states use this
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
sort of service a lot there are many
 
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
firms out there that uh whose business
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
is is working on
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
this okay good representative
 
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
ktoa uh yes thank you thank you madam
 
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.950 align:start position:0%
ktoa uh yes thank you thank you madam
chair

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
um just a quick question on
 
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
the what would disqualify or make the
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
department decide that one of the
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
contractors on the list is not
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
acceptable and what is the criteria for
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
that thank you for that question uh and
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
I would have to follow up with the
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
director he's the one who suggested that
 
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
um that be put in there uh but he didn't
 
00:30:59.310 --> 00:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
tell me what would constitute a
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
disqualification so I can I can make an
 
00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
inquiry about that mam sure yeah because
 
00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:08.519 align:start position:0%
if someone's giving a list then they
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
know um kind of what the criteria is
 
00:31:15.629 --> 00:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
that the Department's looking for in a
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
contractor um you know and make sure
 
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
that you know someone's not wasting
 
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.070 align:start position:0%
that you know someone's not wasting
their

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
time so thank
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
you represent Penza I'm sorry
 
00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:30.559 align:start position:0%
representative ger you had a reply thank
 
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
you yes and I think that's an excellent
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
point I can follow up with the director
 
00:31:37.149 --> 00:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
I will say as as uh Amy maneli said when
 
00:31:39.629 --> 00:31:39.639 align:start position:0%
she testified before the committee that
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
this process is always a negotiation
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
right so that that kind of communication
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
between the applicant and the department
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
would would be regular to try to Define
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
what those parameters are but I will
 
00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
definitely try to to get more
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
clarification from the
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
Department representative Penza and then
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
H Haskins yeah I agree with
 
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative gerana great question
 
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
though representative ktoa um I think
 
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's just there's so many people from
 
00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:09.559 align:start position:0%
the research that U we've done in this
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
whole um net public benefit it it's been
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
going on for a very very long time um
 
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
there's there's agencies that are
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
actually already most of the contractors
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
or the let's say um the industry is
 
00:32:27.149 --> 00:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
already using this on their own so
 
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
before they're even even if a state's
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
not requiring it they have to know that
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
because they still have to put forward
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
their project so environmental Engineers
 
00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:39.799 align:start position:0%
um hydrogeologists that are that are
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
looking at impact um and then they also
 
00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
get the other side of it which is like
 
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
truly just the pure business side of it
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
as well so um this is something that I
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
guess is is very familiar I don't have a
 
00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:56.519 align:start position:0%
problem in a sense with um with Dees
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
determining if they
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
are um you know kind of like a qualified
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
contractor I think to me it would be
 
00:33:06.509 --> 00:33:06.519 align:start position:0%
someone that is doing that work so you
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
know um if they're not doing that work
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
and they're maybe on what I just said
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
one side versus the other they need to
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
have somebody that's really balanced and
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
I think that's the reason why that's in
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
there I'm okay with that but maybe for
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
it to have some sort of qualifier is
 
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
okay too so um but I don't think we can
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
be very specific in this legislation it
 
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
has to be a little bit open so um but um
 
00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
I'm really happy with the amendment
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for all your work yeah
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins thank you madam
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
chair I too am um grateful for the work
 
00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:42.519 align:start position:0%
that's gone into this it's very
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
comprehensive I think it's going to help
 
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
us a lot I'm concerned about the pre
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
when the preliminary review is done is
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
the legislature and perhaps the solid
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
waste subcommittee is somebody going to
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
be brought up to date on where things
 
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
stand and notified if there's a problem
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
with the preliminary review
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative germana uh I not more so
 
00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:12.919 align:start position:0%
than we already have right so if
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
somebody puts in an application and for
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
whatever reason it fails so for example
 
00:34:19.869 --> 00:34:19.879 align:start position:0%
you know cassella has already put in a
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
number of of permit applications and
 
00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
there have been issues with those uh and
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
have been returned to Cella and we don't
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
get informed every time that happen
 
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
happen so um no there would not be more
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
of a formal notification process than we
 
00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
already have when permit applications
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
are returned to applicants
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins followup thank
 
00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
you so if you're content with that that
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
we would um in the the work that the
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee has done and perhaps would
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
continue to do that we wouldn't know
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
exactly how the permitting process is
 
00:34:59.550 --> 00:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
going or how that preliminary review
 
00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:02.599 align:start position:0%
part of the process is
 
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
going I I I am comfortable with it the
 
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
way it is I don't think we need to build
 
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
in a formal notification process I mean
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
we can those of us who are interested
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
and there a lot of us can always make
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
inquiries and that information will be
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
made available so I'm comfortable with
 
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
the way it is okay representative Bixby
 
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
yeah uh I have most I mainly have
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
another another sort of observation
 
00:35:26.349 --> 00:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
question but I just wanted to say that
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
um our departments do a vast number of
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
permit applications we do not want to be
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
informed of the proc of of every step of
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
the process of every permit application
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
going on um it would make the email from
 
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
trivial okay so um but my uh my
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
observation SL question is so in section
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
e where you're talking about potential
 
00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.470 align:start position:0%
e where you're talking about potential
benefits

00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
um you all you end on uh page two line
 
00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:05.720 align:start position:0%
five uh and other factors identify as
 
00:36:08.589 --> 00:36:08.599 align:start position:0%
identified by the contractor uh which I
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
think uh is a we can't anticipate all of
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
the potential benefits that someone
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
might come up with so I think that makes
 
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
sense but I just want to clarify that we
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
do still have at a later section in the
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
bill that any potential benefit or harm
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
has to be Rel related to the specific
 
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
site and it so it can't that that other
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
Factor can't be something in another
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
part of the state right right yes thank
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
you very much that's an excellent point
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
one of the other sections in the bill
 
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
which is not included in this amendment
 
00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
says that it's it is a onetoone right
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
you can make a claim for benefits at one
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
location not bundling multiple locations
 
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
yes correct I I was under that
 
00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
understanding as
 
00:36:56.349 --> 00:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
guber thank thank you madam chair um I'm
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
very supportive of how this has evolved
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
and I think we've addressed the uh the
 
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
comments we've had through many uh
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
feedback on the public hearings uh just
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
just want to make a note that as a
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
professional engineer um sending out
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
statements of qualifications there's a
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
protocol experience background
 
00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
references uh it's a very common
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
practice that I reviewed from
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
Consultants I think it could be done
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
well by what's laid out here for what
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
the statement qualification should cover
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right any other represent
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
Penza um I just I know that we're going
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
to talk about this at another time I
 
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
just um just because it's in reference
 
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
to this I think that um where did you
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
just pass that out um here we
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
go okay so in the in HB I mean um
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
sb2 um the trailer Bill correct y I just
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
want everybody to make notice CU I think
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's really
 
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.190 align:start position:0%
it's really
important

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:06.359 --> 00:38:07.430 align:start position:0%
 
17

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
17
 
00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:15.030 align:start position:0%
17
[Music]

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.309 --> 00:38:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
applications not contain yes
 
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
so until it has in quotes until all
 
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
other state agency approvals have been
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
attained I just think
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
um it's really important I think our
 
00:38:40.829 --> 00:38:40.839 align:start position:0%
bill is very important because this is
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
this is the preliminary like you know
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
where we've been talking about like in a
 
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
sense if there was a you know phase one
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
and phase two process um having having a
 
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
company um go through you know five
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
years worth of work and then have
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
possibly a panel of five people say hey
 
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
sorry your project tuck didn't work that
 
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
that just doesn't you know that just
 
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't fly so I hope um I'm very
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
appreciative of all the work that the
 
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
governor is doing and getting involved
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
in in the solid waste discussions and I
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
think it's important but I also think
 
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
it's important that um the legislature
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
is clear like we've been kind of living
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
and breathing this for a long time and
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
in this process here to have that be at
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
the end would would provide such a
 
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
discern to um you know to the applicants
 
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
and all of that so and we will
 
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
know in the beginning that's the whole
 
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
point right if there if someone's
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
putting a proposal together of like the
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
worst you know it's the worst possible
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
location it's it you know there's no
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
clay it's in it's in poor sand all of
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff that we could rule
 
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
that out in the beginning um why would
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
EV you know why would we have this be
 
00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
right at the end of you know it could be
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
as much as a fiveyear process with a
 
00:39:59.710 --> 00:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
permit so I just wanted to put that
 
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
there because I have spent a little bit
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
of time on this and um but when we get
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
into the nitty-gritty of that you know
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
I'll bring up those types of things and
 
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
I hope you know that I don't know if we
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
could have that kind of open
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
conversation with the governor I think
 
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
that would be wonderful um we could do
 
00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
that as a committee to say hey thank you
 
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
so much um here are some things where
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
we're doing on the legislative side of
 
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
things we we hope you sign these bills
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
and it it might not be necessary to have
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
some of of these things in hb2 so just
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
my two cents yep um that's why I I do I
 
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:35.720 align:start position:0%
want I want to encourage everybody to
 
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
start marking this up and making notes
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
and saying well you know this is already
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
covered in something that we've passed
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
um it may be on its way to the Senate
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
who knows what the senate or the other
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
people across the wall whatever you want
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
to call them um yeah uh so whatever
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
whatever they decide to do with it but
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we do want all
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
this legisl that we've been working on
 
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
both on our side and the other side to
 
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:07.720 align:start position:0%
jive with what is policy in the budget
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
Bill if it's policy in the budget bill
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
is conflicting we have to make a
 
00:41:16.349 --> 00:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
decision where we're going with this and
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
I think that that may happen in a
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee conference it may happen on
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate side we on the other side
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
whatever um so but let's start marking
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
this up and and that
 
00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
way mostly because the FI house finance
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
is looking for direction from us as to
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not what this policy is
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's going into um hp2 makes any sense
 
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
at all representative
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
um the other piece of this is we have we
 
00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
have some committees councils already
 
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
set up right so are we going to now send
 
00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
set up another council is this going to
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
take away from one versus the other and
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
if it did one if it was fully you know
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
occupied actually is is um is a little
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
bit more representative for the public
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
and and for the environment as well as
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
the industry it's more balanced than
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
what this would be so there's there's
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
some conflicts in there which um you
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
know we setting up another another
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
entity just specifically when we already
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
have that like it yeah so there's some
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
confusion in there um just based upon
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
some of this you know the solid waste
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
Council and stuff like that so it's my
 
00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:38.839 align:start position:0%
intention uh for for us to set aside
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
some time to maybe do a work session on
 
00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:44.559 align:start position:0%
this policy that's in the budget Bill uh
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
a the week after we come back from uh
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
next week uh break because that'll give
 
00:42:52.549 --> 00:42:52.559 align:start position:0%
us some time to look it over review it
 
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
and with the mindset of uh you know the
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
the um the solid waste bills that we're
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
intending on passing later this morning
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
um which we've all been working on and
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
this is kind of what we've decided as
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
policy we want to have and uh if again
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
if that doesn't mesh with something
 
00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
that's in this budget bill then we have
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
to bring that out and and see if we can
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
make a tweak to what's in the budget
 
00:43:21.549 --> 00:43:21.559 align:start position:0%
bill or maybe we just say yeah no that's
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
not really a great idea maybe uh Finance
 
00:43:26.549 --> 00:43:26.559 align:start position:0%
needs to strike that whole section out
 
00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know that's that's a discussion
 
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
we have to have representative Bixby
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
yeah uh I just like to say I that I
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
agree with representative patten's
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
concerns uh and I have some additional
 
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
ones on top of that uh I I see the I I
 
00:43:44.549 --> 00:43:44.559 align:start position:0%
think there are number of valuable
 
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
protective elements that the governor is
 
00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.430 align:start position:0%
protective elements that the governor is
s

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
s
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
suggesting uh I'm really concerned with
 
00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:52.839 align:start position:0%
having them all sort of evaluated at the
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
very end yeah and uh and I think that
 
00:43:59.470 --> 00:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of the legislation we're
 
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
working on uh what we're working on is
 
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
essentially a policy that is a house
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
position and uh so we don't need to pay
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
attention to the go what the governor is
 
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
saying in her uh in in her proposal for
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
hb2 in order to evaluate the uh the
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
merits of the policy and the bills that
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
we're looking at we need to pass we need
 
00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.150 align:start position:0%
we're looking at we need to pass we need
to

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
um work on those I and given that they
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
mostly seem pretty good with a little
 
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
bit of tweaking pass them with
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
amendments uh but uh that's that's what
 
00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
we need to do and then we can have
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
negotiations based on what we worked on
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
there of there are things that the
 
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
governor has noticed that need to be
 
00:44:53.309 --> 00:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
addressed that are not in um in one of
 
00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
our bills that's something that would be
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh something to be negotiated
 
00:44:57.839 --> 00:44:58.990 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh something to be negotiated
for

00:44:58.990 --> 00:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
hb2 agreed anyone
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
else okay um I just want to say I want
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
to uh again U uh Echo that um the work
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
that representative King and
 
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
representative gerana and representative
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
Penza all of us have put into this um HB
 
00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
215 and the amendment um I want to
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
congratulate you guys on on doing a
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
really good job and listening
 
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
to people who have testified what their
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
concerns and what their preferences are
 
00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
as well as working with department and
 
00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
department heads uh on on what is
 
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
workable and what makes sense um and I
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
think we've come out with um a really
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
good policy so thank you
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
all um moving on to HB 566 requiring
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
permit applications for new landfills to
 
00:45:59.950 --> 00:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
contain a detailed plan for leech 8
 
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
management and I have before me as well
 
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
um an amendment to that
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
bill oh we have yet a new one an amended
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment an amended Amendment okay so
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
let me put this
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
aside amended Amendment okay cool
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
passing this along to everybody and I
 
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
believe representative gerana wants to
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh talk to us about this amendment thank
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
you very much Madam chair and and and
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
the the most recent amended version
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
which is being passed out now there were
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
a couple of additions that
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh Scully and Gruber
 
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
recommended in our solid waste
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that have been incorporated
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
into this amendment so specifically uh
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
at line
 
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
um uh let's see here yes uh line 10 if
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
you go up actually to the beginning of
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
the sentence at line 8 the lee8
 
00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
management plan shall include at minimum
 
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
a description of how leech 8 will be
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
collected and stored on site and then
 
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
the following Clause was added um by
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation in the solid way
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee if and how it will be
 
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
treated on site so for example right now
 
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
TurnKey treats on site uh so we wanted
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
to include if someone is treating on
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
site that this plan would would include
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
their description of that process and
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
then down at line 13 and I think this
 
00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:29.079 align:start position:0%
was uh very good recommendation I
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
believe it was representative Scully uh
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
that the plan include details of all
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
contractual agreements between the
 
00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:39.559 align:start position:0%
applicant and at least two facilities
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
that will be engaged in the transport
 
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
and the processing of lee8 so that we
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
know that their plan includes backup
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
contingencies if their primary
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
contracted uh facility is unable to to
 
00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
meet their needs I spoke with director
 
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
whims about that he said that you know
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
they would actually they they like
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
having at least two in the statute in
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
rule they may say at least three they
 
00:48:08.829 --> 00:48:08.839 align:start position:0%
want that flexibility to require more
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
but he said at least two would be a good
 
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
addition to statute so I appreciate I
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
think it was representative Scully who
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
who um who proposed that so we had that
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
implemented so uh what this bill does is
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
lines five through about 14 talk about
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
the plan
 
00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
that you would submit with your uh
 
00:48:34.109 --> 00:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
application for lee8 management and then
 
00:48:38.109 --> 00:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
the remainder starting on 14 through 21
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
speak specifically to what has to be
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
included in contractual agreements and
 
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
the director said that he he sees this
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
as uh strengthening their rules and the
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
application of their rules he said that
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
currently uh these facilities have to
 
00:48:57.549 --> 00:48:57.559 align:start position:0%
operators have to have
 
00:48:59.950 --> 00:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
you know they tell Dees we have these
 
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
contracts but uh what this statute will
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
do is actually require more details from
 
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
those contracts be reported to Dees and
 
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
the director said that that would be
 
00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:12.799 align:start position:0%
very helpful for their managing
 
00:49:12.799 --> 00:49:14.349 align:start position:0%
very helpful for their managing
compliance

00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
okay very good any questions or
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
comments thank you for reviewing this
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
with us and thank you for putting it
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
together and again I appreciate the work

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
um due to some issues only uh two
 
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
committee members were able to be here
 
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
um however all stakeholders were here so
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
we had a representation from police
 
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
standards and training the state police
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
um the Chiefs
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
of police uh Farm Bureau Humane Society
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
and someone from the governor's
 
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
Commission on the Humane treatment of
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
animals um all were part of this
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on Friday um it was
 
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
discussed at Great length um
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
that this bill we've been working on a
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
similar bill was tried to be passed last
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
session but we really need to make sure
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
we get it right and we felt that forming
 
00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
a study committee would would be in the
 
00:50:59.309 --> 00:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
best interest
 
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh it would be the most productive way
 
00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
to get this done I'm not sure how to
 
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
handle this where we didn't actually
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
vote in our subcommittee um but we did
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
like I said with all the stakeholders
 
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
and um talked
 
00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.829 align:start position:0%
and um talked
about

00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
the uh turning it into a study committee
 
00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
so my recommendation is this and if
 
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
anyone has any suggestions or questions
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
on the amendment um basically as uh
 
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby knows I put down
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
three representatives and only one
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
Senator um only from past
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
experiences um and basically what the um
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
will be established a study committee
 
00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
adding a Statewide resource to assist
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
with the investigation training
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
prosecution and prompt response of
 
00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:52.630 align:start position:0%
prosecution and prompt response of
animal

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
animal
 
00:51:54.789 --> 00:51:54.799 align:start position:0%
cruelty it was suggested at our
 
00:51:57.789 --> 00:51:57.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting that it might be a
 
00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
volunteer group of law enforcement um
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
officers that would be willing to be
 
00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
resources for this um how that we would
 
00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
do that we're not sure we do know that
 
00:52:13.789 --> 00:52:13.799 align:start position:0%
um if law enforcement goes out uh there
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
would need to be some type of a
 
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement uh and is that from the
 
00:52:21.549 --> 00:52:21.559 align:start position:0%
municipality or however that does Works
 
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
um we need to look at existing training
 
00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
that is provided by the New Hampshire
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
police standards and training Council
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
and other courses that may be available
 
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
either in state or out of state um
 
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
um Education and Training throughout the
 
00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:43.799 align:start position:0%
us on this right now at the police
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
standards anyone going through the
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
academy gets a 2-hour crash course in
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
our animal cruelty laws um but there are
 
00:52:53.549 --> 00:52:53.559 align:start position:0%
resources online to help assist them in
 
00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
this but not everyone accesses that and
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
how do we get people to you know the old
 
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
adage was used you can bring a horse to
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
water but you can't make it drink um the
 
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
other thing was is to identify the best
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
way to train law enforcement and other
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders including prosecutors
 
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
because uh apparently a lot of these
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
cases end up at the county level and the
 
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
County Prosecutors really aren't aware
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
of these laws also uh so there might be
 
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
uh we may need to have some training
 
00:53:26.789 --> 00:53:26.799 align:start position:0%
there um
 
00:53:28.829 --> 00:53:28.839 align:start position:0%
obviously we want to identify the best
 
00:53:30.789 --> 00:53:30.799 align:start position:0%
way to form a group to be a resource for
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
others in New Hampshire uh we recognize
 
00:53:34.829 --> 00:53:34.839 align:start position:0%
that having a group to assist with
 
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
promptness of calls will be in the best
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
interest in of animals in distress so
 
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
you know how do we make sure that that
 
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
happens um we want to work with all the
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
agencies involved in the mission and
 
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
identify any other issues that may need
 
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
to be fil fulfill to fulfill the intent
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
of this committee um and that's it
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
basically and in that shat any question
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
purp in Bixby yeah I'd like to thank you
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
for putting this amendment together um I
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
think that um your description of Duties
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
is is um pretty covers the ground pretty
 
00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
well uh I and I think that one can think
 
00:54:14.589 --> 00:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
of all sorts of other things that one
 
00:54:16.789 --> 00:54:16.799 align:start position:0%
might put into it but that would I think
 
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
that those are things that the committee
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
should be you know that that's the work
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
of the committee to do that so and one
 
00:54:26.589 --> 00:54:26.599 align:start position:0%
of the things that I think that um is
 
00:54:28.829 --> 00:54:28.839 align:start position:0%
important does not need to be in the
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
amendment but I think it's important to
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
consider with the committee is how do we
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
deal with making sure that uh law
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement is up to dat on changes in
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
statute because uh there have been
 
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
changes in the last few years in terms
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
of due process which not everyone would
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
have gotten in their two two-hour crash
 
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
course uh no matter you know how well
 
00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
they remembered things so uh that that's
 
00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
something that I think when we get the
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
committee up and running that should be
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
considered representative K uh thank you
 
00:55:02.829 --> 00:55:02.839 align:start position:0%
representative bxby for that um in all
 
00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
of this came out I asked each of the
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders what they thought uh the
 
00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
mission of this committee should be and
 
00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
what was needed and I tried to
 
00:55:15.789 --> 00:55:15.799 align:start position:0%
incorporate uh a consensus of that so
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
that it covered all areas so thank you
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you no this this is uh really
 
00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
good and
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
um I think this is a
 
00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
you know involved an involved
 
00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.510 align:start position:0%
you know involved an involved
um

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
Mission um and not something that we
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
could just H hand to a subcommittee
 
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
right now to work on I think um this
 
00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
study committee will uh you know will
 
00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
need to take the time to to examine all
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
of these
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
points that being
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
said because
 
00:55:58.750 --> 00:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
of situation that have happened
 
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
whatever I would like to draft a letter
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
on behalf of this committee to give to
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
our commissioner in the department of
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
safety um
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
to direct them to please contact or um
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
get some information out to the
 
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's departments and police State
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
Police whatever all of the law
 
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement arms to please have their
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
members review the cruelty
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
statutes um and because it it was
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
evident even in the testimony that uh
 
00:56:40.349 --> 00:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
some of the law enforcement people just
 
00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:44.200 align:start position:0%
didn't even know what the law is and I
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
think it would at least do something
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
immediately to have uh the commissioner
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
be aware that um at the very least U
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
members of his la enforcement uh
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
Community really do need to review what
 
00:57:03.789 --> 00:57:03.799 align:start position:0%
current Law requires regarding due
 
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
process etc etc and rights of both the
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
animal owners and folks who are making
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
reports so uh representative kto and
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
then Penza thank you madam chair and and
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um during testimony
 
00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
um the person representing the Chiefs uh
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
presented there's a uh they have a it's
 
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
like a
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
5x7 card laminated both sides um for
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
certain uh area of law enforcement and
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
she suggested maybe having something
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
like that that they could actually carry
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
in their vehicles um I don't know if
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
that would be the job of the the study
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
committee or that it would be the job
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
once the study committee is done uh
 
00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:53.079 align:start position:0%
maybe having the governor's commission
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
work on that card um
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement to make sure that
 
00:58:03.789 --> 00:58:03.799 align:start position:0%
um that something that so they can
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
automatically know where to go for a
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
reference and it could be simple as a QR
 
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:11.240 align:start position:0%
code that gives them the updated law
 
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
certainly would be a helpful resource
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
for them representative Penza um thank
 
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I was GNA say exactly
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
not about a letter but just I think that
 
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
was the biggest thing that was um taken
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
from the testimony was um just the
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
unknown aspect of the laws that are
 
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
currently on the books especially with
 
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
having to um contact the veterinarian
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
piece that was um that was really
 
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
important too um that was seemed to be
 
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
unknown as well so I think just stating
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
what they are and I I mean I can
 
00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:47.319 align:start position:0%
understand it's just like here um
 
00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:48.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people that are
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
drinking from a fire hose and training
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
and that's one one day or half a day or
 
00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
whatever it was that they're currently
 
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
getting for that to all be remembered
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
but um I think that that reminder would
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
be really good um because part of it is
 
00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
some of the laws are great resources for
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
them that they might not be utilizing
 
00:59:08.029 --> 00:59:08.039 align:start position:0%
right now and they should be so I I
 
00:59:11.069 --> 00:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
think that's a letter and that reminder
 
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
however it can come out even through the
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
governor's commission that laminated
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
piece however it works I think there's a
 
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
lot of great ideas here that can help uh
 
00:59:21.069 --> 00:59:21.079 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in this process thank
 
00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:23.240 align:start position:0%
you anyone
 
00:59:27.789 --> 00:59:27.799 align:start position:0%
else okay representative Scully
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um I think this is a great
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
idea S I think we've Dem um established
 
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
there's a demonstrated need but rather
 
00:59:39.549 --> 00:59:39.559 align:start position:0%
in rushing into an approach that may
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
have unintended consequences I think
 
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
it's this is an excellent idea to study
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
this issue to make sure we we improve
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
upon um the current processes so we
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
don't have problems going forward um I
 
00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
also I just thinking this through in
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
terms of the Advent of Technology too
 
00:59:59.309 --> 00:59:59.319 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm wondering and of course this
 
01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:01.480 align:start position:0%
could be looked at by the committee
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
whether this might be a good application
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
for um tele medicine to to have um
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
veterinaries uh available so that they
 
01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
actually could be consulted in real time
 
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
if they couldn't necessarily be there to
 
01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
to help screen the initial screen
 
01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:18.799 align:start position:0%
process to make sure that there are less
 
01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:21.880 align:start position:0%
incidences of um again uh the wrong
 
01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
thing being done here so I think this
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
could also be looked at during the
 
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
committee process so I think this is an
 
01:00:28.829 --> 01:00:28.839 align:start position:0%
excellent idea I will definitely be
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
voting for this okay thank you all
 
01:00:35.309 --> 01:00:35.319 align:start position:0%
right okay I guess we can move along and
 
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
um I I will absolutely support this
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
amendment so thank you uh HB 171
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%

01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
chair um this amendment um uh was
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
written week ago there was uh from the
 
01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
uh from the sponsor and co-sponsors they
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
also suggested one additional Amendment
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
that's not on here which is changing the
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
date from 5year moratorium to a
 
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
three-year Mor torum and so that
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
therefore uh I will have that tomorrow a
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
second amendment with that one date
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
changed so this is the amendment without
 
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
that one date changed okay and so the so
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
the date on the original uh bill is uh
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
2030 that would change to
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
2028 and make a three-year moror 8 so
 
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment uh uh just uh Mak uh
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
modifications as we discussed and I
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
think it's consistent with everywhere
 
01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
um so in that we are expecting a CH an
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
amendment a different
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment um that would only change the
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
date that came um we would then recess
 
01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
this we won't consider this for our exec
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
session this after uh this later this
 
01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:26.349 align:start position:0%
session this after uh this later this
morning

01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
but instead do that when we come back
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
from vacation week uh yes or or if
 
01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:32.559 align:start position:0%
tomorrow if you wish you we'll have it
 
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
we won't be executing any bills the next
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
thank sorry for the delay it was the
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
holiday yeah no I get it um certainly a
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
lot of amendments are are not going to
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
be ready because of uh yesterday's uh
 
01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
day off representative
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
germana thank you madam chair I I wanted
 
01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:51.799 align:start position:0%
to point a chest because it has been so
 
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
long since we've talked about this that
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh one of the tweaks that was made that
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
people may recall is a change to lines s
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
and 8 uh originally the the introduced
 
01:03:05.789 --> 01:03:05.799 align:start position:0%
version said that uh the department
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
would not receive applications uh during
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
this moratorium this was changed to say
 
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
the department May accept applications
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
evaluate them for completeness and
 
01:03:17.789 --> 01:03:17.799 align:start position:0%
request more information uh to make an
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%
application complete so that was The
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
Tweak the original Bill said no
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
acceptance this amendment says they can
 
01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
accept it and evaluate it only for
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
completeness that way at the end of a
 
01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
moratorium period if there's an
 
01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
application it's a complete application
 
01:03:36.029 --> 01:03:36.039 align:start position:0%
that they can begin to uh evaluate so I
 
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
know we had discussed that I just wanted
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
to remind people because it feels like
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
it was a long time ago that we talked
 
01:03:43.269 --> 01:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
about that okay does
 
01:03:45.309 --> 01:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
um does the
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
moratorium also um include
 
01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
expansions landfill expansions uh no the
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
mor moratorium in the specific the this
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment does not refer to any
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
expansions of of existing land it's only
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
for well yeah and if I may it's very
 
01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
specifically excludes expansions in
 
01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
section two lines right right okay I
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
didn't read that far thank
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
you okay cool all right so we are going
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
to put this one aside and um wait for uh
 
01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the amendment for next
 
01:04:23.309 --> 01:04:23.319 align:start position:0%
time okay so let me uh that'll be
 
01:04:23.319 --> 01:04:26.190 align:start position:0%
time okay so let me uh that'll be

01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
worked on with representative King that
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
took it down to five
 
01:05:01.269 --> 01:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
whereases um and then changed the
 
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
language around what was resolved
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
basically changing it from encouraging
 
01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
these offices to use all legal Avenues
 
01:05:11.549 --> 01:05:11.559 align:start position:0%
changed it to just resolved it as the
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
position of the house that there should
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
not be a uh okay a landfill I spoke uh
 
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%

whereases and uh we I I have agreed that
 
01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
uh we'll take that one out it's the
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
first one so we'll be down to four

not necessary it doesn't it's not
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be studied we'd
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
already have um a very active Solid
 
01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
Waste working group that will take this
 
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
under consideration and if there needs
 
01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
to be any further legislation or um
 
01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:22.120 align:start position:0%

chair I had a number of constituents
 
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
reach out to me about this because
 
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
they're concerned with the microplastics
 
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
that come from plastic bags um I just
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
want to say to them I share those
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
concerns it's just we don't need a study
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
committee in order to get that done
 
01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
there's a number of ways to move forward
 
01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
with plastic bags and dealing with the
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
microplastics problem without uh a study
 
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
committee this issue has been studied
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
pretty thoroughly so I agree with
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative Penza and I'll be voting
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
to itl this bill thank you represent vix
 
01:23:59.070 --> 01:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I've uh had uh been read some
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
constituents have reached out to me
 
01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
about this and they uh really strongly
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
support legislation to uh limit plastic
 
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
bags uh because of the various you
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
problems ranging from micro
 
01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
microplastics to the interference with
 
01:24:18.189 --> 01:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
uh the recycling system uh and they felt
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
that the solution of having the solid
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
waste working group uh work on it was
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
actually a better solution thank you uh
 
01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
representative guber yeah I just want to
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
concur thank you uh Adam chair uh that
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
the um Plastics working group uh we had
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
dialogue too and this we all hope will
 
01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
be the best most effective way forward
 
01:24:41.229 --> 01:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
yep thank you and you know as a member
 
01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
of the solid waste working
 
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
group first of all you know it was it
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
was evident from uh testimony that there
 
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
are folks out there who have and and
 
01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
organizations who already have done an
 
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of research and I think
 
01:24:58.669 --> 01:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
all of that research can easily be
 
01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:01.639 align:start position:0%
brought to the attention of the solid
 
01:25:03.109 --> 01:25:03.119 align:start position:0%
waste working group where there are
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
legislators like representative eel and
 
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
myself and uh Senator Pearl uh who can
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
take that information and um put
 
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
together some proposed
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
legislation um that that the uh house
 
01:25:20.669 --> 01:25:20.679 align:start position:0%
can consider and the Senate can consider
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
another time so I I support this itl as
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
well I don't think that we have to uh

01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have it available to
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
you in a paper copy so I could have the
 
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
number to the amendment that was just
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
passed to hr10 uh yes I
 
01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
I'll give you mine
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
here you're you're just looking for the
 
01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.669 align:start position:0%
here you're you're just looking for the
number

01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
right consent calendar uh yeah I guess
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh we would put that on the consent
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
calendar unless I mean is that we can
 
01:32:13.709 --> 01:32:13.719 align:start position:0%
read that in in the house or it doesn't
 
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
matter I think I think that it's
 
01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
probably not a good use of time in the
 
01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%

come to a preliminary determination

about public benefits if they determine
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
that there is uh that potential benefits
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
outweigh potential harms then the

motion representative germana uh yes

thank you madam chair so I already spoke
 
01:35:41.470 --> 01:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
to uh the amendment which replaces
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
section one of the uh bill as introduced
 
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
and I would just point out two other
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
features of uh HB 215 that we've
 
01:35:53.229 --> 01:35:53.239 align:start position:0%
discussed as as benefits here one is to
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
say that that when we're determining
 
01:35:57.629 --> 01:35:57.639 align:start position:0%
benefit uh we are talking about one
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
location so an applicant cannot bundle
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
several locations and say well it's the
 
01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
benefit of two or three things it is one
 
01:36:09.550 --> 01:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
location that we'll be looking at uh and
 
01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
then also the
 
01:36:14.830 --> 01:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
bill defines a need more precisely the
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
state supreme court in late
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
2023 issued a ruling around how need was
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
defined and they said it's it's kind of
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
up to Dees to find under current statute
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
what this does uh is it kind of splits
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
the baby in half there were some folks
 
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
who said that uh an applicant would have
 
01:36:34.229 --> 01:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate that there was capacity
 
01:36:36.189 --> 01:36:36.199 align:start position:0%
need for every single day of the
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
lifetime of a facility folks in Industry
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
said no we should just have to
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
demonstrate need for a single day uh in
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
the proposed lifetime of a fa facility
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
this hopefully is the solomonian kind of
 
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
wisdom of uh splitting the uh splitting
 
01:36:56.109 --> 01:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
the lifetime of the landfill in half so
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
you have to demonstrate that there is
 
01:36:59.790 --> 01:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
Need for at least half of the permitted
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
lifetime of the facility
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions or comments
 
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%

it's been said but I just wanted to um
 
01:43:30.510 --> 01:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
recognize that this study CA committee
 
01:43:34.229 --> 01:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
came about due to a
 
01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
um an agreement a bunch through a lot of
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
different groups and that had a lot of
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
input into this and I think that this is
 
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
a great step forward in addressing a lot
 
01:43:48.990 --> 01:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
of issues where we have holes uh dealing
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
with animal
 
01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:52.400 align:start position:0%

glad that we got a lot of good feedback
 
01:44:11.550 --> 01:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
on it and from our stakeholders and from
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
that feedback we figured out what we
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
really need to do as a study committee
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%

01:47:01.229 --> 01:47:01.239 align:start position:0%
uh objection to putting that on consent
 
01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
consent sounds good okay good uh I
 
01:47:07.950 --> 01:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
should probably direct um this bill that
 
01:47:11.589 --> 01:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
it be vacated from um Finance I think it
 
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
was supposed to go to finance
 
01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
after or I don't know wherever it was
 
01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to go should probably be
 
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
vacated I yeah so my guess is it
 
01:47:20.910 --> 01:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
probably would have been going to
 
01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
criminal justice but but it can be
 
01:47:26.430 --> 01:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
I I think that it can be vacated because
 
01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
is that a discussion that you have with
 
01:47:30.589 --> 01:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
the chair of that
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
committee yeah I will I will follow up
 
01:47:36.589 --> 01:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
on that because they may not need to
 
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
hear that yeah okay cool does that mean
 
01:47:41.589 --> 01:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
consent calendar or a consent calendar
 
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
yeah but also I would have to follow up
 
01:47:46.589 --> 01:47:46.599 align:start position:0%
with where it was supposed to go next
 
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
since it's a study
 
01:47:50.709 --> 01:47:50.719 align:start position:0%
committee okay any other comment
 
01:47:55.629 --> 01:47:55.639 align:start position:0%

01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
HB
 
01:55:59.310 --> 01:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
152 yeah yeah yeah um and and I I did
 
01:56:01.629 --> 01:56:01.639 align:start position:0%
get your email representative H Haskins
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
regarding the committee uh researcher
 
01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
report on HB
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
152 regarding glue traps uh your comment
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
is um has been noted that
 
01:56:19.950 --> 01:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
um you felt that it was deficient in um
 
01:56:24.030 --> 01:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
certain points of um support for the
 
01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:27.109 align:start position:0%
certain points of um support for the
bill

01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:31.069 --> 01:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
um I am not uh requesting the committee
 
01:56:33.470 --> 01:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
researcher to make any amendments or
 
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
changes to that because it's kind of
 
01:56:39.790 --> 01:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
already too late to do it but
 
01:56:43.109 --> 01:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
um I I appreciate that you've made some
 
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
comments I don't know if you wanted to
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
say a few words about it well just for
 
01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
clarification um I was concerned that
 
01:56:54.589 --> 01:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
the um report that you forwarded to the
 
01:56:58.270 --> 01:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
committee was incomplete in that it did
 
01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
not uh say that our own fish and game
 
01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
department is opposed to these glut trap
 
01:57:09.069 --> 01:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
bills and that the bill is silent to the
 
01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
issue of insect mitigation so it
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't appear that it's being swept
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
up in the bill because rodents are the
 
01:57:24.910 --> 01:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:28.350 --> 01:57:28.360 align:start position:0%
okay that is duly noted and and uh I
 
01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
hope the
 
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
committee um understands your your
 
01:57:34.390 --> 01:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
position on that representative Miner

copy I know I sent it out electronically

but I also do have a hard copy of the uh
 
01:58:42.030 --> 01:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
the report uh that uh our committee
 
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%

01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
prepared regarding the the glue trap um
 
01:58:52.149 --> 01:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
bill so I'll pass it along and you can
 
01:58:55.790 --> 01:58:55.800 align:start position:0%

represent Penza yeah no just uh quick I
 
01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
I appreciate um you asking the committee
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
researcher for that information I think
 
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
it was helpful I did have a question and
 
01:59:07.229 --> 01:59:07.239 align:start position:0%
it might have been I've already
 
01:59:09.790 --> 01:59:09.800 align:start position:0%
previewed um that not readit you know
 
01:59:11.310 --> 01:59:11.320 align:start position:0%
cover to cover but I've spent a decent
 
01:59:13.470 --> 01:59:13.480 align:start position:0%
amount of time on the report I just
 
01:59:15.870 --> 01:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to understand is this the is this
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
the second time that this bills come
 
01:59:24.669 --> 01:59:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:28.709 --> 01:59:28.719 align:start position:0%
and then um my other question is I
 
01:59:31.470 --> 01:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
haven't reviewed is this the exact same
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
I haven't looked at you know last term
 
01:59:37.950 --> 01:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
in this term is is exactly the same bill
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
or has I don't know does anybody know
 
01:59:44.430 --> 01:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
that was it just a
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
refile Linda substantially the same a
 
01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
little bit of Cleanup in the language
 
01:59:53.629 --> 01:59:53.639 align:start position:0%
but the essence of the bill is quite
 
01:59:55.950 --> 01:59:55.960 align:start position:0%
similar to last session
 
01:59:59.310 --> 01:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
Bill okay okay thank you all right with
 
02:00:01.470 --> 02:00:01.480 align:start position:0%

02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
hour for lunch and uh we'll see you

morning if I could just stay here and
 
02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
manage my Pap that would be something
 
02:00:32.709 --> 02:00:32.719 align:start position:0%
but I need to go to to the break yes

in maram County district 6 as Madame
 
03:33:24.070 --> 03:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
chair has said this is House Bill 505 is
 
03:33:26.550 --> 03:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
to allow the sale of freeze-dried foods
 
03:33:28.950 --> 03:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
produced in Homestead operations the
 
03:33:31.070 --> 03:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
request for this bill came from Donna
 
03:33:33.269 --> 03:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
and Dave Bates of bog Mountain Retreat
 
03:33:35.429 --> 03:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
and Suites and wilmet who are sitting
 
03:33:37.870 --> 03:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
behind me back here they operate under
 
03:33:39.870 --> 03:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Homestead Cottage laws
 
03:33:42.590 --> 03:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
in producing freeze-dried candies they
 
03:33:44.870 --> 03:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
wish to expand their business operation
 
03:33:48.550 --> 03:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
by doing freeze dried ice cream thus
 
03:33:51.269 --> 03:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation the purpose of
 
03:33:52.870 --> 03:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation is to amend the
 
03:33:55.110 --> 03:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
homestead cottage law regulations within
 
03:33:56.990 --> 03:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of Health
 
03:34:00.030 --> 03:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
and Human Services for smallscale food
 
03:34:02.870 --> 03:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
businesses that produce both non
 
03:34:05.910 --> 03:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
perishable and perishable food products
 
03:34:07.990 --> 03:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
including freeze dried items in
 
03:34:10.710 --> 03:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
residential kitchens as you can see
 
03:34:14.670 --> 03:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
under Roman numeral one letter B lines
 
03:34:19.150 --> 03:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:23.469 --> 03:34:23.479 align:start position:0%
bill now I lost my place
 
03:34:26.150 --> 03:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh these are foods that are considered
 
03:34:28.870 --> 03:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous foods because they
 
03:34:31.910 --> 03:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
are temperature control for safety TCS
 
03:34:34.510 --> 03:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
Foods there's a list of which milk and
 
03:34:38.030 --> 03:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
dairy products are included but with
 
03:34:40.349 --> 03:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
specialized freeze-dried process these
 
03:34:43.510 --> 03:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
Foods under the TCS definition would
 
03:34:45.790 --> 03:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
become non-temperature control for
 
03:34:48.870 --> 03:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
safety as they can be safely kept at
 
03:34:52.269 --> 03:34:52.279 align:start position:0%
room temperature and do not require
 
03:34:54.830 --> 03:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
refrigeration thus the added statement
 
03:35:00.150 --> 03:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
amending RSA 143 capital a colon
 
03:35:00.160 --> 03:35:01.910 align:start position:0%
amending RSA 143 capital a colon
12

03:35:01.910 --> 03:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
12
 
03:35:05.550 --> 03:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
to be included under Roman numeral 1B
 
03:35:08.070 --> 03:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
food that is freeze dried shall not be
 
03:35:11.469 --> 03:35:11.479 align:start position:0%
considered potentially hazardous food
 
03:35:14.550 --> 03:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
and then under Roman numeral 4 that
 
03:35:16.429 --> 03:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
begins on page
 
03:35:19.950 --> 03:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:22.990 --> 03:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
26 and the sentences we're looking at
 
03:35:25.710 --> 03:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
are four and five the additional
 
03:35:27.510 --> 03:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
requirement for food safety standards
 
03:35:29.670 --> 03:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
regarding packaging of freeze dry foods
 
03:35:32.349 --> 03:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
that were once perishable and are now
 
03:35:34.670 --> 03:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
shelf stable must contain the
 
03:35:37.229 --> 03:35:37.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate oxygen absorbers for sale
 
03:35:39.670 --> 03:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
and shall contain the additional label
 
03:35:42.550 --> 03:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
not for purposes of rehydrating the
 
03:35:44.510 --> 03:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation establishes an
 
03:35:46.670 --> 03:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
amendment for the homestead license in
 
03:35:48.269 --> 03:35:48.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for freeze drying
 
03:35:50.750 --> 03:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
businesses allowing them to produce both
 
03:35:53.469 --> 03:35:53.479 align:start position:0%
perishable and non- perishable foods
 
03:35:56.349 --> 03:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
including freeze-dried items and dairy
 
03:35:58.750 --> 03:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
products like ice cream in residential
 
03:36:01.590 --> 03:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
kitchens the aim is to provide freeze
 
03:36:03.910 --> 03:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
drying business with flexibility to
 
03:36:05.550 --> 03:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
freeze dry perishable and non-
 
03:36:08.790 --> 03:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
perishable foods while ensuring consumer
 
03:36:11.150 --> 03:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
safety I do hope that the environment
 
03:36:12.830 --> 03:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
and agricultural committee will approve
 
03:36:15.389 --> 03:36:15.399 align:start position:0%
this amending of the present RSA so that
 
03:36:18.110 --> 03:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
it better represents this new freeze
 
03:36:21.070 --> 03:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
dried drying cottage industry that is
 
03:36:24.030 --> 03:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
providing an expansion of our state's
 
03:36:27.670 --> 03:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
economic base for more technical aspects
 
03:36:30.150 --> 03:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
of this freeze dried cottage industry I
 
03:36:32.349 --> 03:36:32.359 align:start position:0%
will defer to my constituents Donna and
 
03:36:35.189 --> 03:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
Dave Bates from Wilmont for answering
 
03:36:37.950 --> 03:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
any of your technical
 
03:36:40.790 --> 03:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
questions I deal with
 
03:36:43.990 --> 03:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
numbers thank
 
03:36:46.630 --> 03:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative shamberg we
 
03:36:49.269 --> 03:36:49.279 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that um representative
 
03:36:51.389 --> 03:36:51.399 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:36:54.550 --> 03:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
for uh testifying today so my
 
03:36:55.950 --> 03:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there's nowhere in
 
03:36:58.389 --> 03:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
statute that labels freeze-dried fruit
 
03:37:00.870 --> 03:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh food as hazardous it's in the rules
 
03:37:02.710 --> 03:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
right and that if we pass this then the
 
03:37:03.710 --> 03:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
Department's going to have to change
 
03:37:05.150 --> 03:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
their rules to better reflect that is
 
03:37:07.590 --> 03:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
that what happens yes it is
 
03:37:10.070 --> 03:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
represent thank you any other questions
 
03:37:12.349 --> 03:37:12.359 align:start position:0%

have a small please first just introduce
 
03:37:47.870 --> 03:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
yourself and where you from and and also
 
03:37:50.469 --> 03:37:50.479 align:start position:0%
I must also say that we are not allowed
 
03:37:54.309 --> 03:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
to use props in our presentations okay I
 
03:37:57.389 --> 03:37:57.399 align:start position:0%
mean you know we can explain a process
 
03:38:00.550 --> 03:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
or something but placards and props are
 
03:38:02.309 --> 03:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
not really supposed to be used in the
 
03:38:04.630 --> 03:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
committee room I'm sorry no that's fine
 
03:38:07.229 --> 03:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
um so I'm Donna Bates I'm from Wilmont
 
03:38:10.750 --> 03:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
and we have a small um freeze drying
 
03:38:13.309 --> 03:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
business did is everything okay oh I'm
 
03:38:13.319 --> 03:38:15.630 align:start position:0%
business did is everything okay oh I'm
sorry

03:38:15.630 --> 03:38:15.640 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:38:21.389 --> 03:38:21.399 align:start position:0%
go ahead I'm sorry go ahead um and we
 
03:38:24.030 --> 03:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
um sorry I got thrown
 
03:38:27.070 --> 03:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
off we U have come across some obstacles
 
03:38:29.469 --> 03:38:29.479 align:start position:0%
so we are allowed to do candy only at
 
03:38:31.910 --> 03:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
the moment any kind of candy that's not
 
03:38:35.030 --> 03:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
perishable um when you freeze dry food a
 
03:38:37.150 --> 03:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
temperature control food like ice cream
 
03:38:39.750 --> 03:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
which you all have in front of you um it
 
03:38:42.830 --> 03:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
turns it into a
 
03:38:45.750 --> 03:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
um a shelf stable food so all the
 
03:38:49.309 --> 03:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
bacteria 99.9% of it is taken out of
 
03:38:51.229 --> 03:38:51.239 align:start position:0%
that food with that moisture is taken
 
03:38:54.550 --> 03:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
out during the process um so it makes it
 
03:38:58.349 --> 03:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
safe um and we would just like to so at
 
03:39:00.870 --> 03:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
the moment we have our uh Homestead
 
03:39:03.349 --> 03:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
Cottage license which allows us to do
 
03:39:06.070 --> 03:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
the candy but if we'd like to expand
 
03:39:08.389 --> 03:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
which we really need to to ice cream and
 
03:39:11.590 --> 03:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
maybe to some other like yogurt for kids
 
03:39:13.429 --> 03:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
and things like that we would be
 
03:39:15.429 --> 03:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
required to do a commercial kitchen
 
03:39:17.510 --> 03:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
which requires us to do three sinks a
 
03:39:21.469 --> 03:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
mop syn a whole different protocol the
 
03:39:24.349 --> 03:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
trays that we use are very small um when
 
03:39:26.269 --> 03:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
we use parchment paper there's little to
 
03:39:28.790 --> 03:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
no residue left over at all um for
 
03:39:30.389 --> 03:39:30.399 align:start position:0%
bacteria's sake to be cleaned again we
 
03:39:32.469 --> 03:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
use new parchment paper there's a whole
 
03:39:35.469 --> 03:39:35.479 align:start position:0%
protocol that you can follow um which we
 
03:39:36.870 --> 03:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
had suggested that maybe there's a
 
03:39:38.349 --> 03:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
compromise that we could just present a
 
03:39:40.950 --> 03:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
protocol and be able to do different
 
03:39:46.189 --> 03:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
foods um singly uh it just felt like
 
03:39:48.790 --> 03:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
trying to do a commercial kitchen in our
 
03:39:51.309 --> 03:39:51.319 align:start position:0%
house just didn't really make sense with
 
03:39:53.269 --> 03:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
what we were trying to do it seemed a
 
03:39:56.830 --> 03:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
little bit extreme and costly um a lot
 
03:39:58.550 --> 03:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
of the candy manufacturers have now seen
 
03:40:00.830 --> 03:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
how successful we have been and they are
 
03:40:03.630 --> 03:40:03.640 align:start position:0%
now doing their own candy so Skittles
 
03:40:06.309 --> 03:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
for example is doing their own and it's
 
03:40:08.469 --> 03:40:08.479 align:start position:0%
it's causing a hit um but a lot of the
 
03:40:10.590 --> 03:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
larger companies won't do ice cream or
 
03:40:12.670 --> 03:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
yogurt or things like that so it would
 
03:40:14.710 --> 03:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
give us a chance to be able to expand
 
03:40:17.750 --> 03:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
Within the same cleanly kitchen that we
 
03:40:19.790 --> 03:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
already use for our candy the same
 
03:40:22.150 --> 03:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
systems apply um but we' be able to do
 
03:40:24.830 --> 03:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
more and not have to have that
 
03:40:27.590 --> 03:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
expense okay questions from the
 
03:40:29.830 --> 03:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
03:40:31.950 --> 03:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you Don and thank you for
 
03:40:33.950 --> 03:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
being here you did well it's not as
 
03:40:36.309 --> 03:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
nerve-wracking as it seems we're all
 
03:40:39.630 --> 03:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
regular people but I do just wanted
 
03:40:42.349 --> 03:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
to know more about the freeze drying
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
process and what it's like to freeze dry
 
03:40:46.830 --> 03:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
an item and then also say thank you for
 
03:40:48.229 --> 03:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
those freeze dried Skittles I've had
 
03:40:51.790 --> 03:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
them they're good so tell us more about
 
03:40:54.150 --> 03:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
freeze drying please okay so the process
 
03:40:57.429 --> 03:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
is pretty controlled um it's a machine
 
03:41:01.309 --> 03:41:01.319 align:start position:0%
that looks like a small beverage um dorm
 
03:41:04.030 --> 03:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
size refrigerator we have two of them um
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
and there's different trays different
 
03:41:07.910 --> 03:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
sizes but we just have medium ones so
 
03:41:11.630 --> 03:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
it's very small controlled um and the
 
03:41:13.550 --> 03:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
trays are about the size of a cookie
 
03:41:16.269 --> 03:41:16.279 align:start position:0%
sheet if I could show you one I would
 
03:41:19.510 --> 03:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
um but they're um very manageable and
 
03:41:21.349 --> 03:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
you put the food that you want to freeze
 
03:41:23.030 --> 03:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
dry or the candy in this case on the
 
03:41:26.149 --> 03:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
tray we wear gloves and masks and do we
 
03:41:28.590 --> 03:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
have certain um sanitizer we're required
 
03:41:31.550 --> 03:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
to use on all of our countertops um but
 
03:41:33.710 --> 03:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
you put the food into the freeze dryer
 
03:41:35.070 --> 03:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
there's certain settings for different
 
03:41:37.590 --> 03:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
things they make it really easy so we
 
03:41:38.950 --> 03:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
literally know that ice cream needs to
 
03:41:41.229 --> 03:41:41.239 align:start position:0%
be set at -20 for initial freeze time
 
03:41:43.070 --> 03:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
and it's already programmed for the
 
03:41:44.670 --> 03:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
amount of hours that you need you can
 
03:41:46.469 --> 03:41:46.479 align:start position:0%
add extra dry time to make sure that
 
03:41:49.229 --> 03:41:49.239 align:start position:0%
you're being really thorough um but it's
 
03:41:52.309 --> 03:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
all pretty much set up for you um from
 
03:41:53.870 --> 03:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
the companies with the freeze dryers
 
03:41:55.670 --> 03:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
that we use they're considered a
 
03:41:58.670 --> 03:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
professional grade within your home um
 
03:42:01.870 --> 03:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
so it's a vacuum chamber and what it
 
03:42:04.750 --> 03:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
does is it initially freezes the food
 
03:42:07.110 --> 03:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
then it vacuum seals it and then it
 
03:42:09.189 --> 03:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
Heats it up to whatever temperature is
 
03:42:11.070 --> 03:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
in the protocol that you've set so for
 
03:42:14.229 --> 03:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
example candy is 150 um food is usually
 
03:42:17.750 --> 03:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
125 for the heat draws out all of the
 
03:42:20.830 --> 03:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
moisture so all that's left once we
 
03:42:23.149 --> 03:42:23.159 align:start position:0%
defrost the machine is like this much
 
03:42:26.550 --> 03:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
water in the bottom of a five gallon tub
 
03:42:28.710 --> 03:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
that goes through a hose and the food
 
03:42:31.030 --> 03:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
comes out crunchy like you'll see the
 
03:42:33.429 --> 03:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
ice cream so it's taken out all of the
 
03:42:35.630 --> 03:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
moisture from the food or
 
03:42:38.309 --> 03:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
99.99% of the moisture as long as you
 
03:42:40.870 --> 03:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
keep it sealed in a myar bag with an
 
03:42:44.189 --> 03:42:44.199 align:start position:0%
oxygen absorber um it will stay in the
 
03:42:46.790 --> 03:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
state that it's intended to stay
 
03:42:50.950 --> 03:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
in traditionally you can freeze dry food
 
03:42:53.830 --> 03:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
I mean it's been done since the 1900s um
 
03:42:54.950 --> 03:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
and you might have heard of Patriots
 
03:42:57.389 --> 03:42:57.399 align:start position:0%
Foods or astronaut ice cream NASA sent
 
03:42:59.590 --> 03:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
this up um because it's lightweight and
 
03:43:01.870 --> 03:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
they're able to eat it and still have
 
03:43:04.349 --> 03:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
that kind of taste of different foods we
 
03:43:06.670 --> 03:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
freeze Dr for our own sake you know
 
03:43:09.229 --> 03:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
different everyday foods to eat at
 
03:43:12.950 --> 03:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
snacks um and it just it's just a it's
 
03:43:14.349 --> 03:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
just a different way of preserving food
 
03:43:15.670 --> 03:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
but it's been done for a really long
 
03:43:15.680 --> 03:43:17.070 align:start position:0%
but it's been done for a really long
time

03:43:17.070 --> 03:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:43:17.080 --> 03:43:18.870 align:start position:0%
time
safely

03:43:18.870 --> 03:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
safely
 
03:43:22.110 --> 03:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
okay represent representative germana
 
03:43:24.149 --> 03:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
did you have a question uh
 
03:43:25.790 --> 03:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler asking so thank
 
03:43:28.070 --> 03:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
03:43:31.710 --> 03:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
fine okay uh representative kto thank
 
03:43:33.469 --> 03:43:33.479 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you very much
 
03:43:35.790 --> 03:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
for bring being here and bringing this
 
03:43:38.750 --> 03:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
important issue to uh the Forefront just
 
03:43:43.269 --> 03:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
a quick question for you um now freeze
 
03:43:45.830 --> 03:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
drying doesn't have to be done
 
03:43:47.830 --> 03:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
just in a freeze-dried piece of
 
03:43:49.590 --> 03:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
equipment it could be done other ways is
 
03:43:49.600 --> 03:43:50.910 align:start position:0%
equipment it could be done other ways is
that

03:43:50.910 --> 03:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:43:53.269 --> 03:43:53.279 align:start position:0%
correct using the equipment is the only
 
03:43:55.550 --> 03:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
way I know about doing it safely with
 
03:43:57.830 --> 03:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
certain protocols and so that that's the
 
03:44:00.429 --> 03:44:00.439 align:start position:0%
only way I know of follow follow up yeah
 
03:44:03.630 --> 03:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm I'm I'm just going to air
 
03:44:06.590 --> 03:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
on the side of um looking at public
 
03:44:09.070 --> 03:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
health and I understand that a
 
03:44:11.790 --> 03:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried machine is really measures
 
03:44:14.750 --> 03:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
the the content of the humidity and the
 
03:44:17.670 --> 03:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
moisture and everything like that but if
 
03:44:19.710 --> 03:44:19.720 align:start position:0%
we just put in that you can freeze dry
 
03:44:22.510 --> 03:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
Foods at home then you could actually
 
03:44:25.070 --> 03:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
use your oven or some other means of
 
03:44:27.070 --> 03:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
doing that I believe I'm just looking
 
03:44:30.110 --> 03:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
here online uh that people can use other
 
03:44:31.950 --> 03:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
methods do you think it should say that
 
03:44:34.429 --> 03:44:34.439 align:start position:0%
it must be done with appropriate
 
03:44:36.389 --> 03:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
equipment that is a great idea
 
03:44:37.950 --> 03:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank
 
03:44:42.269 --> 03:44:42.279 align:start position:0%
you okay I have a question about so the
 
03:44:44.229 --> 03:44:44.239 align:start position:0%
types of food that you've been doing is
 
03:44:46.750 --> 03:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
pretty much candy ice cream yogurt that
 
03:44:49.349 --> 03:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
kind of thing I'm allowed to sell candy
 
03:44:52.070 --> 03:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
I do ice cream and food for family and
 
03:44:54.790 --> 03:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
friends if I'm not selling it um or as
 
03:44:56.790 --> 03:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you presents the teachers at my
 
03:44:58.790 --> 03:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
kids school love it so I can do it as
 
03:45:01.189 --> 03:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank yous but I can't sell it right um
 
03:45:04.510 --> 03:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
so yes so what about um freeze-dried
 
03:45:07.510 --> 03:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
fruit freeze dried Meats I would love to
 
03:45:08.870 --> 03:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
be able to do freeze-dried fruit but
 
03:45:11.590 --> 03:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
there's also in the law a whole protocol
 
03:45:14.149 --> 03:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
where you have to take it and write down
 
03:45:16.030 --> 03:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
a protocol and and send it to Cornell
 
03:45:18.510 --> 03:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
for testing um because there's not
 
03:45:21.070 --> 03:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
anything that can be done um in New
 
03:45:22.790 --> 03:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's just a very very
 
03:45:24.750 --> 03:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
lengthy process so we haven't pursued
 
03:45:27.710 --> 03:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
that yet um but there is a process that
 
03:45:29.710 --> 03:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
you could do to apply for it is that
 
03:45:34.510 --> 03:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
part of the um recipe review thing or is
 
03:45:36.269 --> 03:45:36.279 align:start position:0%
this is something different it's
 
03:45:37.950 --> 03:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
something different that we wish as
 
03:45:40.070 --> 03:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
freeze dryers in our home business we
 
03:45:41.670 --> 03:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
wish we could just freeze dry bananas
 
03:45:43.110 --> 03:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
and strawberries because we're taking
 
03:45:45.110 --> 03:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
the moisture out and therefore
 
03:45:47.830 --> 03:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
eliminating the threat of the bacteria
 
03:45:49.269 --> 03:45:49.279 align:start position:0%
and as long as you put not for the
 
03:45:51.389 --> 03:45:51.399 align:start position:0%
purposes of rehydrating you're not
 
03:45:53.710 --> 03:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
introducing any threats back into it so
 
03:45:56.269 --> 03:45:56.279 align:start position:0%
we should be able to do it just like
 
03:45:58.389 --> 03:45:58.399 align:start position:0%
we're doing Candy our our kitchens are
 
03:45:59.910 --> 03:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
clean they're inspected we have certain
 
03:46:02.030 --> 03:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
protocol we have to follow it's no
 
03:46:04.469 --> 03:46:04.479 align:start position:0%
different whether it's a tray of
 
03:46:06.750 --> 03:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
Skittles or Taffy or whether it's a tray
 
03:46:08.670 --> 03:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
of strawberries you're still taking the
 
03:46:11.110 --> 03:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
same moisture out your trays still have
 
03:46:13.030 --> 03:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
the same residue on them you still
 
03:46:15.189 --> 03:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
follow the same protocols that's what's
 
03:46:18.269 --> 03:46:18.279 align:start position:0%
frustrating is that just by having us go
 
03:46:19.950 --> 03:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
through all the Hoops of a commercial
 
03:46:22.510 --> 03:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
kitchen that requires so much I mean
 
03:46:24.550 --> 03:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
you're talking a food processing plant
 
03:46:26.710 --> 03:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
is what they're asking us to do for what
 
03:46:30.269 --> 03:46:30.279 align:start position:0%
we just want to do on little trays if
 
03:46:32.550 --> 03:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
that makes sense and so you've been
 
03:46:35.790 --> 03:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
making these items the ones that is not
 
03:46:39.590 --> 03:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
legal uh for family and friends as gifts
 
03:46:42.550 --> 03:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
has anybody been sick from that no and
 
03:46:45.229 --> 03:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
um so we originally during covid um
 
03:46:47.790 --> 03:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
looked into different freeze-dried foods
 
03:46:50.830 --> 03:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
that we purchased from Patriots food um
 
03:46:52.670 --> 03:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
but I have a lot of food allergies and
 
03:46:54.870 --> 03:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
so while the family could have them and
 
03:46:57.269 --> 03:46:57.279 align:start position:0%
it be safe um there was nothing I could
 
03:46:59.389 --> 03:46:59.399 align:start position:0%
eat and so we looked into freeze dryers
 
03:47:01.269 --> 03:47:01.279 align:start position:0%
so that I could actually freeze dry food
 
03:47:03.630 --> 03:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
that would be safe for me to eat uh and
 
03:47:06.269 --> 03:47:06.279 align:start position:0%
so we've been freeze drying since 2020
 
03:47:08.590 --> 03:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
um we just opened up a package of turkey
 
03:47:10.269 --> 03:47:10.279 align:start position:0%
from two years ago and turned it into
 
03:47:12.469 --> 03:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
turkey salad and it was an amazing lunch
 
03:47:14.389 --> 03:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
um we have lots of relatives that do it
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
in Utah and we have other friends that
 
03:47:18.309 --> 03:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
have since bought freeze dryers and they
 
03:47:19.950 --> 03:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
make freeze-dried food for themselves
 
03:47:23.229 --> 03:47:23.239 align:start position:0%
now and no one's ever gotten sick again
 
03:47:25.110 --> 03:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
you're you're using the same protocol
 
03:47:26.590 --> 03:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
that you would use if you were cooking
 
03:47:28.309 --> 03:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
for yourself
 
03:47:30.510 --> 03:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
or if you were going to eat ice cream
 
03:47:31.990 --> 03:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
out of a bowl and then go sit on the
 
03:47:34.510 --> 03:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
couch it literally takes me less time to
 
03:47:36.269 --> 03:47:36.279 align:start position:0%
take it from the freezer to the tray to
 
03:47:39.149 --> 03:47:39.159 align:start position:0%
a cold Frozen machine than it what than
 
03:47:40.550 --> 03:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
it would be for you watching your ice
 
03:47:42.550 --> 03:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
cream sitting on your coffee table so
 
03:47:44.469 --> 03:47:44.479 align:start position:0%
all the same protocols for safety are
 
03:47:45.950 --> 03:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
there you're just putting it in a
 
03:47:48.309 --> 03:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
machine and it's taking out the moisture
 
03:47:51.229 --> 03:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
which has the potential to have bacteria
 
03:47:53.830 --> 03:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
in it so and I have one last question
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
and then if anybody else has a questions
 
03:47:59.950 --> 03:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to be hogging the time but
 
03:48:04.070 --> 03:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
um if you were to be able to sell these
 
03:48:07.630 --> 03:48:07.640 align:start position:0%
other items that you're seeking to make
 
03:48:10.630 --> 03:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
legal um how much do you think that
 
03:48:13.309 --> 03:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
would increase your income for your
 
03:48:16.070 --> 03:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
business lifechanging honestly we're
 
03:48:17.910 --> 03:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
really really at a standstill when we
 
03:48:20.469 --> 03:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
first started this a year ago and we
 
03:48:22.510 --> 03:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
were looking into how popular the ice
 
03:48:25.790 --> 03:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
cream was we had over 150 emails asking
 
03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
me if I could sell them the ice cream
 
03:48:28.469 --> 03:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
when we said we were thinking about
 
03:48:30.469 --> 03:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
doing it and I had to say no to every
 
03:48:31.950 --> 03:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
single one of them and direct them to
 
03:48:33.790 --> 03:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
other people online from different
 
03:48:36.429 --> 03:48:36.439 align:start position:0%
states that can sell it so there's I I
 
03:48:39.070 --> 03:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
still get requests every day every week
 
03:48:40.429 --> 03:48:40.439 align:start position:0%
for people wanting to know if I could
 
03:48:43.990 --> 03:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
sell the ice cream and I can't unless I
 
03:48:45.870 --> 03:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
go through the all the Hoops of a
 
03:48:47.590 --> 03:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen and honestly I would
 
03:48:50.149 --> 03:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
never use three sinks to wash one little
 
03:48:52.189 --> 03:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
tray it just it doesn't make sense for
 
03:48:55.070 --> 03:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
the flow okay thank you representative
 
03:48:57.269 --> 03:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:48:57.279 --> 03:48:58.670 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair thank you for
taking

03:48:58.670 --> 03:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
taking
 
03:49:02.510 --> 03:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
questions if you have any kind of food
 
03:49:06.630 --> 03:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
that um is left out to rot um and then
 
03:49:09.110 --> 03:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily the that bacteria
 
03:49:11.110 --> 03:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
you'd be worried about I would imagine
 
03:49:13.510 --> 03:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
it would be the toxins left behind by
 
03:49:15.309 --> 03:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
the bacteria if you if you were to
 
03:49:17.750 --> 03:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
freeze dried if you were to freeze dry
 
03:49:21.389 --> 03:49:21.399 align:start position:0%
food that already had toxic buildup in
 
03:49:24.229 --> 03:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
it I mean would it then be safe or would
 
03:49:26.349 --> 03:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
it it it would then be so how how does
 
03:49:28.790 --> 03:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
how do you how do you maintain the
 
03:49:31.550 --> 03:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
safety of freeze-dried food just like
 
03:49:33.469 --> 03:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
you do with freeze-dried candy I'm not
 
03:49:36.510 --> 03:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
going to have you know I wouldn't spray
 
03:49:38.469 --> 03:49:38.479 align:start position:0%
my Skittles with toxic cleaner and then
 
03:49:39.750 --> 03:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
put them in the freeze dryer and sell
 
03:49:41.590 --> 03:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
them to people I'm not going to take ice
 
03:49:42.870 --> 03:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
cream that's been sitting out on the
 
03:49:45.269 --> 03:49:45.279 align:start position:0%
counter for an hour and then freeze dry
 
03:49:46.910 --> 03:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
it it's the common sense protocol of
 
03:49:49.309 --> 03:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
what would you do and whether I had a
 
03:49:50.710 --> 03:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen or my residential
 
03:49:52.149 --> 03:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
kitchen the protocol is still going to
 
03:49:54.630 --> 03:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
be the same I'm still going to take
 
03:49:58.830 --> 03:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
caution and prepare everything as if I
 
03:50:01.990 --> 03:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
were serving it to my own child so that
 
03:50:03.510 --> 03:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
if there's bacteria on it just like if
 
03:50:04.630 --> 03:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
you were to go to a restaurant and
 
03:50:06.469 --> 03:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
somebody sneezes on the food or bacteria
 
03:50:07.830 --> 03:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
gets into it and you eat it you're still
 
03:50:10.189 --> 03:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
going to get sick you can only prevent
 
03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
so much but the process of freeze drying
 
03:50:15.149 --> 03:50:15.159 align:start position:0%
between either a residential k or a
 
03:50:17.750 --> 03:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen is the exact same
 
03:50:20.710 --> 03:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
process does that make sense I think so
 
03:50:22.070 --> 03:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
I have to think about that thank you
 
03:50:23.990 --> 03:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative Miner thank you
 
03:50:25.149 --> 03:50:25.159 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking
 
03:50:27.910 --> 03:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
questions let me ask you a question are
 
03:50:28.950 --> 03:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
are you an
 
03:50:31.870 --> 03:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
LLC um no we're just to DBA uh do you
 
03:50:34.110 --> 03:50:34.120 align:start position:0%
have insurance for we do we have a lot
 
03:50:36.910 --> 03:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
of insurance perfect thank you which we
 
03:50:38.710 --> 03:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
could also require of people that wanted
 
03:50:40.429 --> 03:50:40.439 align:start position:0%
to sell it if that needed to be in there
 
03:50:41.510 --> 03:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
I absolutely think that would be a
 
03:50:43.590 --> 03:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
requirement most um companies that
 
03:50:45.349 --> 03:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
freeze dry even with can candy it's
 
03:50:47.349 --> 03:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
recommended and a lot of the stores
 
03:50:49.229 --> 03:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
won't want you to sell it unless you
 
03:50:51.389 --> 03:50:51.399 align:start position:0%
have insurance oh that's very true so
 
03:50:52.590 --> 03:50:52.600 align:start position:0%
it's one of the very first things that
 
03:50:54.710 --> 03:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
we did and it doubled our insurance so
 
03:50:56.309 --> 03:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
being able to expand what we can sell
 
03:50:57.990 --> 03:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
would be really helpful right
 
03:51:00.030 --> 03:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
now representative
 
03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
Scully thank you Madame chair do you
 
03:51:04.750 --> 03:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
make your own ice cream is is this a a
 
03:51:06.349 --> 03:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
process you do all the way or you buy it
 
03:51:09.149 --> 03:51:09.159 align:start position:0%
from other people no I buy a tmook
 
03:51:10.950 --> 03:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
usually is the one that I buy it's one
 
03:51:12.309 --> 03:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
that's the most recommended it's what
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
everyone has today it has really more
 
03:51:17.309 --> 03:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
natural clean ingredients and not a lot
 
03:51:21.670 --> 03:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
of the extra synthetic stuff in it um I
 
03:51:23.269 --> 03:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
don't want to make my own ice cream
 
03:51:24.469 --> 03:51:24.479 align:start position:0%
because that would just open up a whole
 
03:51:26.750 --> 03:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
another can of worms and put more strain
 
03:51:28.590 --> 03:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
on systems which we're trying not to do
 
03:51:30.550 --> 03:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
we're trying to keep it really really
 
03:51:31.750 --> 03:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
simple which is why we even use
 
03:51:33.710 --> 03:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
parchment paper during our process so
 
03:51:35.790 --> 03:51:35.800 align:start position:0%
that we don't have any extra fat or
 
03:51:37.870 --> 03:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
anything else going into our
 
03:51:40.750 --> 03:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
system a followup please followup y all
 
03:51:42.469 --> 03:51:42.479 align:start position:0%
right so then when you make your
 
03:51:45.149 --> 03:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried ice cream are you carrying
 
03:51:47.710 --> 03:51:47.720 align:start position:0%
over the list of ingredients that are in
 
03:51:49.710 --> 03:51:49.720 align:start position:0%
the original ice cream putting that
 
03:51:50.790 --> 03:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
that's what's on the back of your
 
03:51:53.590 --> 03:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
package right straightly from the telok
 
03:51:57.750 --> 03:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
website okay thank you anyone else have
 
03:51:59.950 --> 03:51:59.960 align:start position:0%

03:53:01.229 --> 03:53:01.239 align:start position:0%
administrator within the division of
 
03:53:02.990 --> 03:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services and we'll be
 
03:53:05.550 --> 03:53:05.560 align:start position:0%
providing the testimony
 
03:53:07.670 --> 03:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
today thank you members of the committee
 
03:53:09.070 --> 03:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to speak today on
 
03:53:10.309 --> 03:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:53:13.189 --> 03:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
505 um so this bill would amend the
 
03:53:14.870 --> 03:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
definition of potentially hazardous
 
03:53:17.429 --> 03:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
foods um to state that F freeze-dried
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
foods would not be considered
 
03:53:19.439 --> 03:53:20.630 align:start position:0%
foods would not be considered
potentially

03:53:20.630 --> 03:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
03:53:22.870 --> 03:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
hazardous currently the department does
 
03:53:26.110 --> 03:53:26.120 align:start position:0%
not allow for I need you to speak up a
 
03:53:29.229 --> 03:53:29.239 align:start position:0%
little bit y currently the department
 
03:53:31.070 --> 03:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
does not allow for freeze died Foods in
 
03:53:33.389 --> 03:53:33.399 align:start position:0%
a homestead food operation and those are
 
03:53:35.630 --> 03:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried non or potentially
 
03:53:37.830 --> 03:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
hazardous foods we do allow non-
 
03:53:39.110 --> 03:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous foods to be
 
03:53:41.229 --> 03:53:41.239 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried in a homestead food
 
03:53:43.790 --> 03:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
operation freeze drying is a specialized
 
03:53:45.910 --> 03:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
process whereby by the water activity of
 
03:53:47.910 --> 03:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
the product is reduced to a point where
 
03:53:50.510 --> 03:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
it does not allow harmful micro
 
03:53:53.269 --> 03:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
organisms to grow freeze drying
 
03:53:56.910 --> 03:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:59.030 --> 03:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
products I'm
 
03:54:02.030 --> 03:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
sorry um takes a product through a
 
03:54:04.110 --> 03:54:04.120 align:start position:0%
drying process to bring the water
 
03:54:05.830 --> 03:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
activity low enough again so that
 
03:54:07.910 --> 03:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
there's no no room for growth of harm
 
03:54:07.920 --> 03:54:08.790 align:start position:0%
there's no no room for growth of harm
from

03:54:08.790 --> 03:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:54:10.950 --> 03:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
microorganisms if the process is not
 
03:54:13.670 --> 03:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
done properly it can leave a product
 
03:54:18.830 --> 03:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:21.510 --> 03:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
grow due to safety concerns of this
 
03:54:23.950 --> 03:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
process it is important that the product
 
03:54:27.229 --> 03:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
is evaluated by a processing authority
 
03:54:29.710 --> 03:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
to set the parameters by which the
 
03:54:31.309 --> 03:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
process can be done
 
03:54:33.990 --> 03:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
safely it also should be conducted in a
 
03:54:36.349 --> 03:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
commercial facility using commercial
 
03:54:39.269 --> 03:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
equipment Homestead food operations
 
03:54:41.790 --> 03:54:41.800 align:start position:0%
operations are not required to use
 
03:54:44.030 --> 03:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
commercial equipment and by expanding
 
03:54:45.670 --> 03:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
these types of potentially hazardous
 
03:54:47.269 --> 03:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
foods to be allowed in a homestead
 
03:54:49.349 --> 03:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
kitchen there is concern that the
 
03:54:52.389 --> 03:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
equipment may not be adequate to produce
 
03:54:54.830 --> 03:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
a consistent and safe
 
03:54:57.070 --> 03:54:57.080 align:start position:0%
product the bill would also require that
 
03:54:58.950 --> 03:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried foods contain the
 
03:55:01.710 --> 03:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate oxid oxygen absorber when
 
03:55:04.269 --> 03:55:04.279 align:start position:0%
packaged these parameters are not set by
 
03:55:08.189 --> 03:55:08.199 align:start position:0%
the department these are generally laid
 
03:55:10.349 --> 03:55:10.359 align:start position:0%
out by a processing processing Authority
 
03:55:12.630 --> 03:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
who has looked at the process and the
 
03:55:14.670 --> 03:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
product that wants that is is being
 
03:55:16.670 --> 03:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
produced to evaluate the safety
 
03:55:18.710 --> 03:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
parameters that need to be met to create
 
03:55:20.990 --> 03:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
a safe
 
03:55:23.550 --> 03:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
product the department would like to
 
03:55:27.349 --> 03:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
also share that in 2013 we did have a
 
03:55:30.830 --> 03:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
outbreak associated with dried meat
 
03:55:33.349 --> 03:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
products it was a dehydrated meat
 
03:55:35.550 --> 03:55:35.560 align:start position:0%
product but the process of dehydration
 
03:55:37.349 --> 03:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
and the process of freeze drying are
 
03:55:39.990 --> 03:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
similar by where why whereby you're
 
03:55:41.910 --> 03:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
reducing the water activity create to
 
03:55:45.309 --> 03:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
create a safe product
 
03:55:48.149 --> 03:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
there were 43 people who became ill with
 
03:55:50.670 --> 03:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
salmonella um from chicken jerky pet
 
03:55:53.750 --> 03:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
treats um that were sold and produced
 
03:55:56.469 --> 03:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
from a home
 
03:55:58.710 --> 03:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
kitchen thank you and I'm happy to
 
03:56:00.710 --> 03:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
03:56:03.189 --> 03:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
questions and I'll just add that we did
 
03:56:05.429 --> 03:56:05.439 align:start position:0%
provide you with the case information so
 
03:56:07.750 --> 03:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
you should have our testimony and then
 
03:56:11.149 --> 03:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
um a a summary of the case information
 
03:56:17.149 --> 03:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:20.790 --> 03:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
2013 okay um representative King thank
 
03:56:23.030 --> 03:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
you madam chair uh two Qui questions you
 
03:56:27.429 --> 03:56:27.439 align:start position:0%
said um it was people that got sick from
 
03:56:30.630 --> 03:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
chicken jerky pet treats so they were
 
03:56:33.590 --> 03:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
eating dog food or I don't know they
 
03:56:36.710 --> 03:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
were handling they handled pet treats oh
 
03:56:38.550 --> 03:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
they okay so the people that made the
 
03:56:40.670 --> 03:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
chicken jerky were also handling pet
 
03:56:43.429 --> 03:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
treats and that's how so the the chicken
 
03:56:45.710 --> 03:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
jerky was a pet treat okay so they were
 
03:56:48.429 --> 03:56:48.439 align:start position:0%
creating pet treats out of chicken okay
 
03:56:51.070 --> 03:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
so they dehydrated it and it was
 
03:56:53.269 --> 03:56:53.279 align:start position:0%
dehydrated improperly so it allowed for
 
03:56:55.910 --> 03:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
the grow of growth of salmonella in
 
03:56:58.070 --> 03:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
which the handling of the treat then
 
03:57:00.429 --> 03:57:00.439 align:start position:0%
spread food born elness wow okay thank
 
03:57:02.590 --> 03:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
you and then my other uh quick question
 
03:57:04.710 --> 03:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
is are is the department neutral on this
 
03:57:07.910 --> 03:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
bill or is it against it is there a
 
03:57:10.590 --> 03:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
stance so we're neutral but we wanted to
 
03:57:12.550 --> 03:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
present our serious concerns with
 
03:57:14.670 --> 03:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
respect to this okay thank you this
 
03:57:18.030 --> 03:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
spell representative H Haskins thank you
 
03:57:18.040 --> 03:57:18.870 align:start position:0%
spell representative H Haskins thank you
madam

03:57:18.870 --> 03:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
madam
 
03:57:22.950 --> 03:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
chair would you entertain the thought
 
03:57:27.030 --> 03:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
that if a step towards allowing people
 
03:57:29.710 --> 03:57:29.720 align:start position:0%
who have been safely producing food in
 
03:57:32.510 --> 03:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
their home kitchen to expand to
 
03:57:35.469 --> 03:57:35.479 align:start position:0%
something like yogurt and ice
 
03:57:40.030 --> 03:57:40.040 align:start position:0%
cream as a step forward perhaps in time
 
03:57:43.550 --> 03:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
other freeze dried foods could be
 
03:57:47.590 --> 03:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
entered in into the statute would you be
 
03:57:50.590 --> 03:57:50.600 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with
 
03:57:54.189 --> 03:57:54.199 align:start position:0%
that so the
 
03:57:56.389 --> 03:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
concern I know we we talked a lot about
 
03:57:57.630 --> 03:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
ice cream and
 
03:57:57.640 --> 03:57:59.189 align:start position:0%
ice cream and
yogurt

03:57:59.189 --> 03:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
yogurt
 
03:58:01.590 --> 03:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
um we're not the ones that determine
 
03:58:02.670 --> 03:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
those safety
 
03:58:05.590 --> 03:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
parameters um we really rely on science
 
03:58:07.630 --> 03:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
we really rely on these food processing
 
03:58:09.229 --> 03:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
authorities who can give us the
 
03:58:12.510 --> 03:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
parameters so the food processors
 
03:58:14.830 --> 03:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
processing authorities will look at all
 
03:58:18.870 --> 03:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
steps of the process and the product so
 
03:58:19.990 --> 03:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to look at it from start
 
03:58:21.309 --> 03:58:21.319 align:start position:0%
to finish they're going to look at the
 
03:58:22.590 --> 03:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
recipe they're going to look at the
 
03:58:24.269 --> 03:58:24.279 align:start position:0%
process and then they're going to look
 
03:58:26.429 --> 03:58:26.439 align:start position:0%
at the final process uh product I'm
 
03:58:28.429 --> 03:58:28.439 align:start position:0%
sorry to make sure that they've hit each
 
03:58:29.910 --> 03:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
of these
 
03:58:32.630 --> 03:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
parameters to to give a blanket
 
03:58:34.510 --> 03:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
statement that that these products are
 
03:58:36.510 --> 03:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
okay but these products aren't it's hard
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
for it's not something that we can
 
03:58:39.990 --> 03:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
determine okay we really rely on that
 
03:58:42.030 --> 03:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
processing authority to give us those
 
03:58:45.830 --> 03:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
details quick followup if I may sir so
 
03:58:48.070 --> 03:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass this bill and it
 
03:58:51.870 --> 03:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
became law um people who have been
 
03:58:54.710 --> 03:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
safely producing food in their home
 
03:58:58.149 --> 03:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
kitchen like candy um would have the
 
03:59:01.990 --> 03:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to expand and there would be
 
03:59:04.990 --> 03:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
an inspection all the kinds of protocols
 
03:59:07.229 --> 03:59:07.239 align:start position:0%
that they've sub been subject to all
 
03:59:11.590 --> 03:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
along and we would have data um to
 
03:59:14.710 --> 03:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
inform future decisions about
 
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:26.189 --> 03:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
not we would for for those specific
 
03:59:30.110 --> 03:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
items however this gives the opening the
 
03:59:32.469 --> 03:59:32.479 align:start position:0%
definition to non or to potentially
 
03:59:35.189 --> 03:59:35.199 align:start position:0%
hazardous products opens the door to not
 
03:59:40.189 --> 03:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
just dairy or milk products or yogurt
 
03:59:42.070 --> 03:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
unless we amended the bill correct it
 
03:59:43.469 --> 03:59:43.479 align:start position:0%
would open it up to any non-p
 
03:59:44.990 --> 03:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
potentially ha products so you're
 
03:59:47.469 --> 03:59:47.479 align:start position:0%
talking meat products
 
03:59:51.309 --> 03:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
um any any food product really um that
 
03:59:53.469 --> 03:59:53.479 align:start position:0%
is potentially hazardous could be
 
03:59:55.990 --> 03:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried in the homestead
 
03:59:58.910 --> 03:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
kitchen thank you represent Bixby and
 
04:00:00.910 --> 04:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
then we're going to go over to Miner
 
04:00:04.070 --> 04:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so um we heard testimony that uh
 
04:00:06.830 --> 04:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
freeze drying of fruits would not be
 
04:00:10.790 --> 04:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
allowed uh and I'm are fruits
 
04:00:14.790 --> 04:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
potentially H hazardous um food when
 
04:00:18.189 --> 04:00:18.199 align:start position:0%
they're just you know if you like pick
 
04:00:19.990 --> 04:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
an apple from your tree is that a
 
04:00:22.950 --> 04:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous fruit uh food they
 
04:00:25.149 --> 04:00:25.159 align:start position:0%
can be it depends on the the ph and
 
04:00:28.830 --> 04:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
water activity of the product
 
04:00:31.110 --> 04:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
so depending
 
04:00:34.429 --> 04:00:34.439 align:start position:0%
on it depends on the product okay so I
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just going so so would would I
 
04:00:38.520 --> 04:00:40.429 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just going so so would would I
be

04:00:40.429 --> 04:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:00:40.439 --> 04:00:42.590 align:start position:0%
be
would

04:00:42.590 --> 04:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:00:46.030 --> 04:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
uh are you
 
04:00:48.510 --> 04:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
would root that is just picked off from
 
04:00:52.790 --> 04:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
a tree be allowed to be S sold under our
 
04:00:52.800 --> 04:00:55.349 align:start position:0%
a tree be allowed to be S sold under our
current

04:00:55.349 --> 04:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:57.710 --> 04:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
statutes just picked off a tree yes
 
04:01:00.070 --> 04:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's it's whole produce okay so whole
 
04:01:02.070 --> 04:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
produce that hasn't been processed any
 
04:01:04.389 --> 04:01:04.399 align:start position:0%
further is allowed to be sold as is as
 
04:01:08.110 --> 04:01:08.120 align:start position:0%
soon as you take um a a whole produce
 
04:01:09.870 --> 04:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
and you continue to process it by
 
04:01:13.910 --> 04:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
cutting it then it becomes it falls to
 
04:01:15.030 --> 04:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
to food
 
04:01:18.550 --> 04:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
protection okay so so uh actually
 
04:01:21.309 --> 04:01:21.319 align:start position:0%
selling cut apples would not be allowed
 
04:01:24.870 --> 04:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
under current law under Homestead no
 
04:01:26.590 --> 04:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
okay so you need to have a commercial
 
04:01:29.110 --> 04:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
kitchen to do that correct okay thank
 
04:01:32.110 --> 04:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
you representative Miner thank you madam
 
04:01:34.389 --> 04:01:34.399 align:start position:0%
chair the case study that you refer to
 
04:01:40.510 --> 04:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
is 2013 that as uh chairman um Aaron is
 
04:01:42.790 --> 04:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
indicated it's well over 13 years ago
 
04:01:44.790 --> 04:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
would you agree that standards have
 
04:01:46.229 --> 04:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
changed and Equipment has changed the
 
04:01:49.389 --> 04:01:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:52.110 --> 04:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
changed I I don't know that I can speak
 
04:01:54.229 --> 04:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
to that yes I I'm sure things have come
 
04:01:57.550 --> 04:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
a long way since then so would you Al
 
04:01:59.269 --> 04:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
followup followup so would you also
 
04:02:02.229 --> 04:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
agree that probably back in 2013 the
 
04:02:04.110 --> 04:02:04.120 align:start position:0%
equipment that was used is probably not
 
04:02:05.870 --> 04:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
as um good as
 
04:02:08.030 --> 04:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
today I don't know that I can speak to
 
04:02:10.110 --> 04:02:10.120 align:start position:0%
that but there is a difference um there
 
04:02:13.349 --> 04:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
are differences between um commercial
 
04:02:15.550 --> 04:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
equipment and non commercial equipment
 
04:02:18.389 --> 04:02:18.399 align:start position:0%
and the concern would be that if they're
 
04:02:20.070 --> 04:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
not using commercial equipment it may
 
04:02:22.550 --> 04:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
not produce a
 
04:02:26.030 --> 04:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
consistently um dried product thank you
 
04:02:28.590 --> 04:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
representive kalk thank you madam chair
 
04:02:30.229 --> 04:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here and
 
04:02:33.149 --> 04:02:33.159 align:start position:0%
testifying just a quick look at this
 
04:02:36.389 --> 04:02:36.399 align:start position:0%
case study that where uh individuals
 
04:02:40.149 --> 04:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
were harmed from semilla I noticed that
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
it has to do with a
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
dehydrator we're talking about and there
 
04:02:48.070 --> 04:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
is a difference between a dehydrator in
 
04:02:51.229 --> 04:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
a freeze-dried machine for Freez drying
 
04:02:56.030 --> 04:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
Foods um So based on
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
that did was this actually using a
 
04:03:02.030 --> 04:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
freeze dryer or just a dehydrator thank
 
04:03:05.309 --> 04:03:05.319 align:start position:0%
you for the question it it was a
 
04:03:07.389 --> 04:03:07.399 align:start position:0%
dehydrator there is a difference between
 
04:03:10.349 --> 04:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
freeze drying and dehydrating however
 
04:03:12.189 --> 04:03:12.199 align:start position:0%
the safety parameters is reducing the
 
04:03:13.910 --> 04:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
water activity they're just doing it in
 
04:03:15.790 --> 04:03:15.800 align:start position:0%
two different ways one's using heat and
 
04:03:18.670 --> 04:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
one's doing using freeze drying follow
 
04:03:20.710 --> 04:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
up thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:03:23.349 --> 04:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question but because
 
04:03:27.309 --> 04:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
a freeze dried machine not a dehydrator
 
04:03:30.349 --> 04:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
actually monitors moisture content
 
04:03:33.149 --> 04:03:33.159 align:start position:0%
vacuum seals and other things I think
 
04:03:35.550 --> 04:03:35.560 align:start position:0%
it's a very specific piece of equipment
 
04:03:37.309 --> 04:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it can be compared to
 
04:03:40.550 --> 04:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
a dehydrator and I think from that point
 
04:03:43.189 --> 04:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
of view this is how we have to look at
 
04:03:44.830 --> 04:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation because we're
 
04:03:46.990 --> 04:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
looking at and making sure and if we add
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
in that they're using the proper machine
 
04:03:50.910 --> 04:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
a freeze-dried machine and not a
 
04:03:53.830 --> 04:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
dehydrator or an oven I think would make
 
04:03:56.030 --> 04:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
it much
 
04:03:59.030 --> 04:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
safer okay representative
 
04:04:01.950 --> 04:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
King oh did you want to reply to that I
 
04:04:04.149 --> 04:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
was just going to mention that um these
 
04:04:05.910 --> 04:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
types of processes whether it's freeze
 
04:04:08.670 --> 04:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
drying or uh dehydration these are
 
04:04:11.030 --> 04:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
specialty processes and really a
 
04:04:13.870 --> 04:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
processing Authority is is is necessary
 
04:04:15.910 --> 04:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the equipment is
 
04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate that the process is used and
 
04:04:21.870 --> 04:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
and um the you know looks at the entire
 
04:04:24.110 --> 04:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
process so these are not something that
 
04:04:26.990 --> 04:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
is generally we can set General
 
04:04:29.030 --> 04:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
Provisions for this is done through a
 
04:04:31.389 --> 04:04:31.399 align:start position:0%
scientific review such as a process
 
04:04:34.030 --> 04:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
Authority at Cornell um or other
 
04:04:36.189 --> 04:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
processes process authorities at I think
 
04:04:38.349 --> 04:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
there's one in Maine as well so this is
 
04:04:41.229 --> 04:04:41.239 align:start position:0%
a you know not a just because it's a
 
04:04:43.149 --> 04:04:43.159 align:start position:0%
piece of equipment doesn't mean that
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
this isn't a specialty process and could
 
04:04:49.070 --> 04:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
um by not following proper procedures
 
04:04:52.030 --> 04:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
could introduce some foodborn illness
 
04:04:54.870 --> 04:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you representative King
 
04:04:56.910 --> 04:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
you had a question yeah thank you again
 
04:04:58.990 --> 04:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
Madam chair um I'm just trying to wrap
 
04:05:01.429 --> 04:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
my head around the concern
 
04:05:05.830 --> 04:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
here for hazardous foods there for
 
04:05:07.550 --> 04:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
homesteaders making hazardous foods and
 
04:05:09.349 --> 04:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
selling hazardous foods there's a
 
04:05:12.590 --> 04:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
there's a higher standard for the
 
04:05:15.110 --> 04:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
processing right so for example you know
 
04:05:16.870 --> 04:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're butchering meat or
 
04:05:19.269 --> 04:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
something you're going to need you're
 
04:05:20.550 --> 04:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
going to need to meet a much higher
 
04:05:23.790 --> 04:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
standard and the concern is that people
 
04:05:26.309 --> 04:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
who don't meet that higher standard for
 
04:05:29.110 --> 04:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
say butchering meat out of their home
 
04:05:30.710 --> 04:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to sort of get
 
04:05:33.429 --> 04:05:33.439 align:start position:0%
around that standard by just saying okay
 
04:05:35.229 --> 04:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
well I can't sell it as fresh meat but
 
04:05:37.349 --> 04:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
I'll just sell it as freeze-dried meat
 
04:05:39.309 --> 04:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
and so you might have people you know
 
04:05:42.309 --> 04:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
butchering meat in their in their uh in
 
04:05:44.750 --> 04:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
their garage and the garage can't be the
 
04:05:46.309 --> 04:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
the walls and the ceilings can't be
 
04:05:48.070 --> 04:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
washed and so you've got this kind of
 
04:05:51.309 --> 04:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
Chop Shop of like filth and but they can
 
04:05:54.790 --> 04:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
get around it by Fe freeze drying it and
 
04:05:55.990 --> 04:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
I think there's a little bit of a
 
04:05:57.750 --> 04:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
confusion here because the process of
 
04:06:01.670 --> 04:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
freeze drying um in and of itself may be
 
04:06:04.750 --> 04:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
safe but if if the food was contaminated
 
04:06:06.950 --> 04:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
before you even freeze dry it you've
 
04:06:08.990 --> 04:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
still got a problem with the toxins that
 
04:06:10.710 --> 04:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
have built up the freeze drying might
 
04:06:12.790 --> 04:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
kill the bacteria but it's not going to
 
04:06:14.469 --> 04:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
it's not going to neutr uze the toxins
 
04:06:16.510 --> 04:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
that are in there so am I understanding
 
04:06:19.189 --> 04:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
this correctly is that your
 
04:06:21.830 --> 04:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
concern thank you for the question so
 
04:06:24.389 --> 04:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
yes there are concerns because you're
 
04:06:27.309 --> 04:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
taking a potentially hazardous product
 
04:06:31.189 --> 04:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
and through the process of freeze drying
 
04:06:34.870 --> 04:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
you're turning it into a non-
 
04:06:36.910 --> 04:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous product which is
 
04:06:39.429 --> 04:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
the same thing you would do in a retail
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
facility the cooking um chicken you cook
 
04:06:44.269 --> 04:06:44.279 align:start position:0%
it to 165
 
04:06:47.189 --> 04:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it's safe for
 
04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
consumption this specialized
 
04:06:52.349 --> 04:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
process isn't measured by just
 
04:06:54.510 --> 04:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
temperature it's time it's temperature
 
04:06:58.790 --> 04:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's equipment it's how um how you cut
 
04:07:00.750 --> 04:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
and process the product that's going
 
04:07:02.870 --> 04:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
into the freeze dryer so if you don't
 
04:07:05.389 --> 04:07:05.399 align:start position:0%
meet those steps in between you can
 
04:07:07.030 --> 04:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
leave the end product which you're
 
04:07:11.469 --> 04:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
assuming is a non-tcs product or a non
 
04:07:14.070 --> 04:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous product and you
 
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
may have missed reducing the water
 
04:07:19.750 --> 04:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
activity enough in the process to allow
 
04:07:23.590 --> 04:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
it to be safe in the end followup follow
 
04:07:25.510 --> 04:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
up okay but my my specific concern isn't
 
04:07:27.710 --> 04:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
so much about the water content and
 
04:07:29.950 --> 04:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not whether or not that will
 
04:07:32.510 --> 04:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
inhibit bacterial growth my my concern
 
04:07:34.750 --> 04:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
really is that this idea that there
 
04:07:38.790 --> 04:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
might be people that are doing something
 
04:07:41.269 --> 04:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
unsanitary before even the freeze-dried
 
04:07:42.950 --> 04:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
process starts the food gets
 
04:07:45.710 --> 04:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
contaminated with toxins and then it
 
04:07:47.510 --> 04:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
just get freeze dried and the toxins are
 
04:07:48.990 --> 04:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
still there that's my concern is that
 
04:07:51.309 --> 04:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
your concern as well
 
04:07:54.750 --> 04:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
so it's it's the pro it's in the process
 
04:07:55.230 --> 04:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
so if
 
04:07:55.240 --> 04:07:56.349 align:start position:0%
so if
[Music]

04:07:56.349 --> 04:07:56.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
we I if you if you missed step on water
 
04:08:05.309 --> 04:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
activity yes there can be room for micro
 
04:08:08.990 --> 04:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
organisms to grow once it's been
 
04:08:11.870 --> 04:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried representative Bixby
 
04:08:15.469 --> 04:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
representative com um I'm so I'm trying
 
04:08:18.510 --> 04:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
to figure out where where the line is
 
04:08:20.349 --> 04:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
where something goes from unaccept
 
04:08:21.550 --> 04:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
acceptable to
 
04:08:23.630 --> 04:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
unacceptable uh
 
04:08:26.070 --> 04:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
so if
 
04:08:29.950 --> 04:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh so is it the case that if you start
 
04:08:38.510 --> 04:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
out with a uh a a food that is non uh um
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
non-hazardous and you freeze dry it that
 
04:08:44.670 --> 04:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
is just okay
 
04:08:49.429 --> 04:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
so uh for example if I made blueberry
 
04:08:52.710 --> 04:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
jam and I freeze DED it then that would
 
04:08:53.870 --> 04:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
be just
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
fine uh but if I did say
 
04:09:01.030 --> 04:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
blueberry yogurt that would be
 
04:09:03.149 --> 04:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
problematic is that Thea is that the
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
case yes than because the yogurt part is
 
04:09:09.429 --> 04:09:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
food if I may follow up on
 
04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative King's question so so um
 
04:09:18.229 --> 04:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
if there were particular toxins in a
 
04:09:20.870 --> 04:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
product um that you're referring to that
 
04:09:22.750 --> 04:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
the the act of freeze drying certainly
 
04:09:25.389 --> 04:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't remove any tox toxins from the
 
04:09:28.229 --> 04:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
product they would remain in there if
 
04:09:29.670 --> 04:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
that helps your if that helps answer
 
04:09:31.830 --> 04:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
your question okay representative ktoa
 
04:09:34.750 --> 04:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
and then Miner thank you madam chair and
 
04:09:37.790 --> 04:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you so as I'm listening here
 
04:09:40.550 --> 04:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
and as I listened to uh testimony
 
04:09:44.269 --> 04:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
earlier it seems like what they're doing
 
04:09:46.910 --> 04:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
is they're buying already food that is
 
04:09:48.750 --> 04:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
processed and
 
04:09:51.070 --> 04:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
acceptable and then they're taking that
 
04:09:54.950 --> 04:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
and freeze drying it so if we put in
 
04:09:57.990 --> 04:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
there that it's already processed food
 
04:09:59.149 --> 04:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
then it should be allowed to be
 
04:10:01.910 --> 04:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried in a freeze-dried machine
 
04:10:05.349 --> 04:10:05.359 align:start position:0%
not a dehydrator I think um we're
 
04:10:07.030 --> 04:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
getting in the weeds when we're talking
 
04:10:10.149 --> 04:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
about you know chicken that's uncooked
 
04:10:11.790 --> 04:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
they're we're actually talking about
 
04:10:14.030 --> 04:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
food that is readily
 
04:10:16.429 --> 04:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
already there on the shelf and they're
 
04:10:20.030 --> 04:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
just bringing it into the home and
 
04:10:23.030 --> 04:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
freeze drying it um so
 
04:10:23.040 --> 04:10:24.950 align:start position:0%
freeze drying it um so
please

04:10:24.950 --> 04:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:10:27.550 --> 04:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
so and thank you for for it's not a
 
04:10:30.550 --> 04:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
question but thank you for that um uh
 
04:10:33.309 --> 04:10:33.319 align:start position:0%
statement I I would I would add that the
 
04:10:36.469 --> 04:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
act of freeze drying can introduce if
 
04:10:40.510 --> 04:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
it's not done correctly it can introduce
 
04:10:43.469 --> 04:10:43.479 align:start position:0%
um microorganisms into the products so
 
04:10:45.750 --> 04:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
even though the product may not have
 
04:10:47.670 --> 04:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
microorganisms and you can correct me if
 
04:10:50.389 --> 04:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong um may not have
 
04:10:52.630 --> 04:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
microorganisms at the start the ACT if
 
04:10:55.630 --> 04:10:55.640 align:start position:0%
it's not done correctly then and and
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
determined by a process Authority that
 
04:10:58.830 --> 04:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
is not the Department of Health and
 
04:11:00.790 --> 04:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
Human Services that does that or nor has
 
04:11:03.109 --> 04:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
the expertise to do that then it can
 
04:11:05.510 --> 04:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
render the product there could be um
 
04:11:07.750 --> 04:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
toxins and it's exactly what happened in
 
04:11:09.510 --> 04:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
the case that we
 
04:11:11.870 --> 04:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
presented you know we shared with you is
 
04:11:15.389 --> 04:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
that the product had allowed for growth
 
04:11:17.349 --> 04:11:17.359 align:start position:0%
of Sal Manila and then sickened people
 
04:11:19.910 --> 04:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
who became exposed to it so that's the
 
04:11:22.269 --> 04:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
Department's concern is it's the actual
 
04:11:24.750 --> 04:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
act act of the process that if not done
 
04:11:28.510 --> 04:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
correctly could introduce um you know
 
04:11:31.070 --> 04:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
concerns okay representative
 
04:11:33.910 --> 04:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
Miner representative ger thank you madam
 
04:11:35.229 --> 04:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
chairman wouldn't you would don't you
 
04:11:37.710 --> 04:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
agree that the iron speaks loud here
 
04:11:41.550 --> 04:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
where uh Kil and Tyson and uh
 
04:11:44.309 --> 04:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
SBA a month doesn't go by when when
 
04:11:45.870 --> 04:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
their food isn't recalled for some sort
 
04:11:48.269 --> 04:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
of botulism or some sort of salmonella
 
04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a small Homestead
 
04:11:52.469 --> 04:11:52.479 align:start position:0%
operation here I think we're I think
 
04:11:54.189 --> 04:11:54.199 align:start position:0%
we're really looking at over over
 
04:11:57.070 --> 04:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
regulating this do you
 
04:12:00.990 --> 04:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
agree no I I don't just because the the
 
04:12:02.870 --> 04:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
the process itself the active freeze
 
04:12:05.630 --> 04:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
drying is if not done correctly can add
 
04:12:07.790 --> 04:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh can introduce forood born
 
04:12:10.429 --> 04:12:10.439 align:start position:0%
illness quick
 
04:12:13.469 --> 04:12:13.479 align:start position:0%
followup I asked earlier um um the
 
04:12:15.030 --> 04:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
people that own the homestead and I'm
 
04:12:16.630 --> 04:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
sorry I can't remember I don't recall
 
04:12:18.269 --> 04:12:18.279 align:start position:0%
her name that owns the store they have
 
04:12:20.149 --> 04:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
insurance they have saf guards in place
 
04:12:23.550 --> 04:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
in case of uh an accidental
 
04:12:26.790 --> 04:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
um poisoning let's
 
04:12:29.990 --> 04:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
say so the question is do you agree that
 
04:12:32.870 --> 04:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
that would be enough um safeguard for
 
04:12:34.189 --> 04:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
this type of
 
04:12:37.750 --> 04:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
operation thank you for that um our
 
04:12:39.710 --> 04:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
concern in public health is to prevent
 
04:12:42.750 --> 04:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
foodborn illness so we're not looking at
 
04:12:45.109 --> 04:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
a reactive approach to this we're trying
 
04:12:48.630 --> 04:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
to take a proactive approach um in in
 
04:12:50.630 --> 04:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
limiting what's being
 
04:12:53.229 --> 04:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
done what products are being done in
 
04:12:56.070 --> 04:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
with this specialized product process to
 
04:12:57.550 --> 04:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that there is no food born
 
04:12:59.070 --> 04:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
illness so we we really want to take
 
04:13:01.389 --> 04:13:01.399 align:start position:0%
that um proactive approach
 
04:13:03.670 --> 04:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative germana thank you madam
 
04:13:04.870 --> 04:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:13:06.469 --> 04:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
so the phrase I've heard you say a
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
number of times which seems to me key in
 
04:13:11.109 --> 04:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
all of this is if not done correctly and
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
so could you speak to the difference
 
04:13:15.710 --> 04:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
between the type of equipment that might
 
04:13:18.229 --> 04:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
be used in a commercial facility as
 
04:13:20.750 --> 04:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to the kind of equipment that
 
04:13:23.910 --> 04:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
one might buy for a home operation and
 
04:13:27.309 --> 04:13:27.319 align:start position:0%
how the difference between those might
 
04:13:28.830 --> 04:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
account for something not being done
 
04:13:30.990 --> 04:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
correctly because I can see a situation
 
04:13:32.910 --> 04:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
where if you're buying a piece of
 
04:13:35.349 --> 04:13:35.359 align:start position:0%
equipment to do this in your home and it
 
04:13:37.590 --> 04:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
is on kind of the lower end of of
 
04:13:39.950 --> 04:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
expense it's not a commercial grade
 
04:13:42.710 --> 04:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
freeze dryer that it may not hit the
 
04:13:44.349 --> 04:13:44.359 align:start position:0%
target it might tell you that it hits
 
04:13:46.910 --> 04:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
the target that it has removed all of
 
04:13:49.389 --> 04:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
the moisture that needs to be removed
 
04:13:51.950 --> 04:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
but presumably the kinds that are used
 
04:13:54.790 --> 04:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
in commercial operations are more
 
04:13:56.630 --> 04:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
accurate when it comes to being able to
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
to to measure that so could you speak to
 
04:13:59.910 --> 04:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
the difference between the kinds of
 
04:14:02.429 --> 04:14:02.439 align:start position:0%
equipment used in commercial operations
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
versus other kinds that may not be as
 
04:14:08.910 --> 04:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
good at verifying that the process has
 
04:14:10.750 --> 04:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
been done
 
04:14:12.830 --> 04:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
correctly yes thank you for that I will
 
04:14:16.030 --> 04:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
I will will do my best um
 
04:14:19.469 --> 04:14:19.479 align:start position:0%
so the difference would be the intent so
 
04:14:22.870 --> 04:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
for home residential equipment the
 
04:14:26.630 --> 04:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
intent is for um production on a on a
 
04:14:30.389 --> 04:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
smaller scale for you know home home
 
04:14:33.870 --> 04:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
production when you are looking to sell
 
04:14:36.590 --> 04:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
at retail they
 
04:14:39.630 --> 04:14:39.640 align:start position:0%
they're the intent is
 
04:14:45.030 --> 04:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
that commercial um the size so the and
 
04:14:48.990 --> 04:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
the intent of the sale so we there are
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
standards that commercial equipment need
 
04:14:54.269 --> 04:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
to to meet to make sure that um the
 
04:14:58.070 --> 04:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
intent of um the use of
 
04:15:00.870 --> 04:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
the commercial equipment
 
04:15:00.880 --> 04:15:03.670 align:start position:0%
the commercial equipment
is

04:15:03.670 --> 04:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:15:08.070 --> 04:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
proper um Can can I add to that um so
 
04:15:09.750 --> 04:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
yes I think I think the equipment
 
04:15:12.189 --> 04:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
differs in terms of its capabilities and
 
04:15:14.550 --> 04:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
the other part which I I I can't stress
 
04:15:17.149 --> 04:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
enough is the process itself is unique
 
04:15:19.990 --> 04:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
for each food product so understanding
 
04:15:21.990 --> 04:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
how long how long you keep it in there
 
04:15:25.189 --> 04:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
what the temperature is or you know the
 
04:15:27.229 --> 04:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
the entire looking at the entire process
 
04:15:30.109 --> 04:15:30.119 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the food is processed
 
04:15:31.990 --> 04:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately that really needs to go
 
04:15:33.750 --> 04:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
through a process Authority that the
 
04:15:36.030 --> 04:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
department does not have the expertise
 
04:15:37.630 --> 04:15:37.640 align:start position:0%
to look at every whether you're freeze
 
04:15:39.469 --> 04:15:39.479 align:start position:0%
drying a piece of fruit or freeze drying
 
04:15:41.550 --> 04:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
a piece of meat or freeze drying you
 
04:15:43.309 --> 04:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
know whatever the product is those are
 
04:15:45.950 --> 04:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
not uniform so we can't set uniform
 
04:15:48.590 --> 04:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
standards in rule or law that looks at
 
04:15:51.349 --> 04:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
each every and and applies it evenly
 
04:15:54.710 --> 04:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
across across the board to say it's safe
 
04:15:57.349 --> 04:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
it really is dependent on the product at
 
04:15:59.469 --> 04:15:59.479 align:start position:0%
hand that you're trying to produce and
 
04:16:02.070 --> 04:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
the experts need to weigh in on that and
 
04:16:04.550 --> 04:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
and and then we can understand what the
 
04:16:07.030 --> 04:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
what the parameters are to making sure
 
04:16:09.469 --> 04:16:09.479 align:start position:0%
that that food is produced safely thank
 
04:16:11.389 --> 04:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
you U representative Scully and then
 
04:16:14.349 --> 04:16:14.359 align:start position:0%
representative uh wheeler and then Bixby
 
04:16:17.990 --> 04:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so is it um legal
 
04:16:20.550 --> 04:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
to make and sell freeze-dried ice cream
 
04:16:22.830 --> 04:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire currently under the
 
04:16:27.109 --> 04:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
homestead um no just can anybody do it
 
04:16:28.590 --> 04:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
we we would require them to be in a
 
04:16:32.750 --> 04:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
commercial um facility yes okay so and
 
04:16:35.429 --> 04:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
have a license may I follow yes sure a a
 
04:16:37.870 --> 04:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
commercial facility can can do after
 
04:16:39.790 --> 04:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
your inspection so it's a requirement
 
04:16:42.070 --> 04:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
for inspection correct all right one
 
04:16:43.550 --> 04:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
want to follow up please
 
04:16:47.309 --> 04:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
so if um Can is it possible to inspect
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
Homestead operations or do they lose
 
04:16:51.830 --> 04:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
their status if you come in and look at
 
04:16:54.550 --> 04:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
those no we do we we license uh we do
 
04:16:56.790 --> 04:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
license and inspect homesteads uh there
 
04:16:58.469 --> 04:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
are categories of homesteads that are
 
04:17:00.189 --> 04:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
exempt that are exempt from licensing
 
04:17:01.830 --> 04:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
inspection but there are homesteads that
 
04:17:04.189 --> 04:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
we do license and inspect may ask one
 
04:17:06.349 --> 04:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
quite the quick question thank you um
 
04:17:08.389 --> 04:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
how how honorous is the inspection is it
 
04:17:10.349 --> 04:17:10.359 align:start position:0%
is there a great cost to the person
 
04:17:13.790 --> 04:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:15.990 --> 04:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
um does I'm sorry thank you for the
 
04:17:18.070 --> 04:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
question if I'm understanding correct
 
04:17:21.510 --> 04:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
are you asking if there's a cost to the
 
04:17:24.070 --> 04:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
producer for the inspection or for the
 
04:17:26.750 --> 04:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
license yeah does what costs were
 
04:17:29.149 --> 04:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
involved to the person who is trying to
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
provide that service or create that
 
04:17:33.950 --> 04:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
product it's the for paid to us would be
 
04:17:36.429 --> 04:17:36.439 align:start position:0%
the licensing
 
04:17:40.269 --> 04:17:40.279 align:start position:0%
fee um representative kto wanted to add
 
04:17:42.510 --> 04:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
to what you were saying uh thank you
 
04:17:45.550 --> 04:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair representative um Scully I
 
04:17:47.189 --> 04:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
believe that they're already licensed
 
04:17:50.189 --> 04:17:50.199 align:start position:0%
under the Homestead Act already The Next
 
04:17:52.469 --> 04:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
Step would be is the commercial kitchen
 
04:17:54.750 --> 04:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
which is extremely expensive it's the
 
04:17:57.790 --> 04:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of dollars um so just
 
04:18:00.349 --> 04:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
so you know there is the homestad food
 
04:18:02.670 --> 04:18:02.680 align:start position:0%
act so where there's exemptions but no
 
04:18:04.550 --> 04:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
inspection and then there's a next step
 
04:18:06.630 --> 04:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
up if you want to sell in retail places
 
04:18:08.830 --> 04:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
or whatever you have to be licensed and
 
04:18:11.469 --> 04:18:11.479 align:start position:0%
that's where DHHS comes in but there are
 
04:18:13.149 --> 04:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
certain foods that are Exempted under
 
04:18:17.830 --> 04:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:20.109 --> 04:18:20.119 align:start position:0%
correctly certain foods yes so non
 
04:18:22.070 --> 04:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
potentially haard food correct correct
 
04:18:25.070 --> 04:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
and then to do anything else it's a
 
04:18:26.429 --> 04:18:26.439 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen
 
04:18:28.870 --> 04:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
license all right so thank you so I
 
04:18:30.750 --> 04:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
guess we're trying to allow them to do
 
04:18:32.149 --> 04:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
this without becoming a commercial
 
04:18:34.750 --> 04:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
kitchen okay represent Bixby and then
 
04:18:37.070 --> 04:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
wheeler or or was
 
04:18:43.229 --> 04:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
it yeah so go ahead so if uh so
 
04:18:45.950 --> 04:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
I'm I gather that there are both sort of
 
04:18:49.550 --> 04:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
um hom grade and commercial grade
 
04:18:52.670 --> 04:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
dehydrators if someone were to have a
 
04:18:54.750 --> 04:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
freeze dryers freeze freeze not yeah
 
04:18:58.389 --> 04:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
freeze dryers um so if someone were to
 
04:19:02.550 --> 04:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
have a uh commercial grade freeze dryer
 
04:19:06.429 --> 04:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
and use recipes that were that were uh
 
04:19:09.429 --> 04:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
recommended by that freeze drying freeze
 
04:19:09.439 --> 04:19:10.710 align:start position:0%
recommended by that freeze drying freeze
dryers

04:19:10.710 --> 04:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
dryers
 
04:19:13.630 --> 04:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturer uh
 
04:19:20.910 --> 04:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:24.429 --> 04:19:24.439 align:start position:0%
safe I I guess I couldn't speak to that
 
04:19:27.710 --> 04:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know if they have
 
04:19:32.349 --> 04:19:32.359 align:start position:0%
recipes standard recipes for so so um I
 
04:19:35.269 --> 04:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
presumably if someone is in a commercial
 
04:19:37.510 --> 04:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
kitchen running a
 
04:19:40.990 --> 04:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
dehydrator then they are using uh would
 
04:19:43.950 --> 04:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
they be using recipes that had G
 
04:19:47.990 --> 04:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
undergone process review yes okay so if
 
04:19:51.910 --> 04:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
someone were to uh do the same thing but
 
04:19:54.510 --> 04:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
not in a commercial kitchen would what
 
04:19:59.790 --> 04:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:02.469 --> 04:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
safe so I don't know that we can fully
 
04:20:04.309 --> 04:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
answer that I mean one thing that a
 
04:20:06.429 --> 04:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
concern that comes to mind is whether
 
04:20:09.870 --> 04:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
the um process has gone under review
 
04:20:12.990 --> 04:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
including the space so I think you know
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
the in a commercial kitchen there are
 
04:20:18.189 --> 04:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
certain standards that have to be met
 
04:20:20.870 --> 04:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
and those standards wouldn't NE you know
 
04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
beyond just the freeze dryer I think
 
04:20:26.590 --> 04:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here freeze dryer
 
04:20:28.750 --> 04:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
there's other there's other standards in
 
04:20:31.590 --> 04:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
a commercial kitchen that protect you
 
04:20:33.349 --> 04:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
know that serve for food protection as
 
04:20:35.349 --> 04:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
well so I think I think we can't sit
 
04:20:37.030 --> 04:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
here and say yes absolutely it would be
 
04:20:39.070 --> 04:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
safe in that instance because there's
 
04:20:41.830 --> 04:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
still some concerns about whether
 
04:20:44.349 --> 04:20:44.359 align:start position:0%
there's potential for food uh food born
 
04:20:47.070 --> 04:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
illness as a result of the process okay
 
04:20:50.189 --> 04:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
um follow up follow up so with the level
 
04:20:50.199 --> 04:20:52.070 align:start position:0%
um follow up follow up so with the level
of

04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:20:56.910 --> 04:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
um of uh thoroughness for inspection of
 
04:20:59.309 --> 04:20:59.319 align:start position:0%
a commercial kitchen be higher than the
 
04:21:01.630 --> 04:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
level of thoroughness for in of
 
04:21:06.429 --> 04:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
inspection for a licensed Homestead food
 
04:21:09.990 --> 04:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
operation it it's not it would not the
 
04:21:12.269 --> 04:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
thoroughness I mean we're uh the
 
04:21:14.229 --> 04:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
department takes food safety seriously
 
04:21:16.269 --> 04:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
so you know we're th whether we're in a
 
04:21:19.910 --> 04:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
homestead or a commercial space
 
04:21:22.790 --> 04:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
however depending on the process and the
 
04:21:25.429 --> 04:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
product and the license class there are
 
04:21:27.990 --> 04:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
different standards that need to be met
 
04:21:31.229 --> 04:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
okay so I guess what I'm wondering
 
04:21:34.870 --> 04:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
is if someone had commercial if someone
 
04:21:36.830 --> 04:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
on a with a homestead license had a
 
04:21:40.030 --> 04:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
commercial freeze dryer would that be a
 
04:21:42.590 --> 04:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
viable possibility or would that just be
 
04:21:44.469 --> 04:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
outside the realm of what you would
 
04:21:48.630 --> 04:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
consider safe so it's not just about the
 
04:21:51.309 --> 04:21:51.319 align:start position:0%
equipment it really is about the product
 
04:21:53.429 --> 04:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
and the process and the evaluation of
 
04:21:57.229 --> 04:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
the product um and then um and then the
 
04:21:59.030 --> 04:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
inspection to to ensure that they're
 
04:22:01.030 --> 04:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
Meeting those safety parameters okay
 
04:22:04.550 --> 04:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you okay um down on this side who
 
04:22:06.389 --> 04:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
who wanted to go oh representative
 
04:22:08.550 --> 04:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
wheeler go ahead and then thank you
 
04:22:11.070 --> 04:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair can you tell us a little bit
 
04:22:13.990 --> 04:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
more about the process that DHHS uses to
 
04:22:15.670 --> 04:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not they support or
 
04:22:19.790 --> 04:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:21.790 --> 04:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
legislation so the department would
 
04:22:25.349 --> 04:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
evaluate the um St you know the the
 
04:22:27.710 --> 04:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
concerns I can speak to in terms of
 
04:22:29.189 --> 04:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
Public Health so we look at the public
 
04:22:31.550 --> 04:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
health risk and if we have concerns we
 
04:22:33.309 --> 04:22:33.319 align:start position:0%
would you know certainly bring those
 
04:22:34.950 --> 04:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
forward those are discussed internally
 
04:22:37.070 --> 04:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
at the department and we determine
 
04:22:39.229 --> 04:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not we would uh have a formal
 
04:22:41.550 --> 04:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
position as I said earlier we're neutral
 
04:22:43.189 --> 04:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
but we wanted to make sure we brought
 
04:22:45.070 --> 04:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
forward the concerns that we have
 
04:22:49.109 --> 04:22:49.119 align:start position:0%
relative um to freeze drying follow up
 
04:22:51.550 --> 04:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
followup this has been alluded to by
 
04:22:52.950 --> 04:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative Miner and representative
 
04:22:54.870 --> 04:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
Aaron but uh in the case study you
 
04:22:58.189 --> 04:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
brought forward to us was uh one case of
 
04:23:01.429 --> 04:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
this happening in 11 years or something
 
04:23:04.389 --> 04:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
along those lines wouldn't that indicate
 
04:23:07.149 --> 04:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
to you that this in fact is a safe
 
04:23:10.349 --> 04:23:10.359 align:start position:0%
procedure and people uh only one
 
04:23:13.349 --> 04:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
instance have somebody doing this in an
 
04:23:16.910 --> 04:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
unsafe way in the last 11 years seems to
 
04:23:19.109 --> 04:23:19.119 align:start position:0%
me you know accidents do happen we're
 
04:23:21.630 --> 04:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
not going to have zero of these cases so
 
04:23:23.990 --> 04:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
one in 11 years seems to me like this is
 
04:23:28.670 --> 04:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
working out pretty well and I I guess
 
04:23:31.750 --> 04:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
the I have a disconnect between the
 
04:23:33.269 --> 04:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
concern and the prevalence that I'm
 
04:23:35.109 --> 04:23:35.119 align:start position:0%
seeing of the accidents that happen in
 
04:23:37.710 --> 04:23:37.720 align:start position:0%
this case you Rectify
 
04:23:42.510 --> 04:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
that I so this you know expanding the
 
04:23:44.309 --> 04:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
visions that are currently allowed for
 
04:23:46.790 --> 04:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
right now do not include uh potentially
 
04:23:49.590 --> 04:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
hazardous foods and so that is a better
 
04:23:52.269 --> 04:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
practice best practice so by expanding
 
04:23:54.469 --> 04:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
that the the the the department has
 
04:23:56.910 --> 04:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
concerns about the way this legislation
 
04:23:59.030 --> 04:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
is written about expanding that to
 
04:24:01.630 --> 04:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
include non poent I'm sorry potentially
 
04:24:05.070 --> 04:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
hazardous foods that could introduce a
 
04:24:07.590 --> 04:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
greater risk moving forward if this
 
04:24:09.710 --> 04:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
legislation were enacted because it
 
04:24:12.030 --> 04:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
could could create concerns about
 
04:24:13.950 --> 04:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
addition food born
 
04:24:16.389 --> 04:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
illness and I I can just follow up on
 
04:24:20.109 --> 04:24:20.119 align:start position:0%
that um as as Michelle noted it's not
 
04:24:24.389 --> 04:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
currently allowed so this is not a um a
 
04:24:26.830 --> 04:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
current practice that
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
happens generally with food I would
 
04:24:31.429 --> 04:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
follow up but then it would be
 
04:24:33.910 --> 04:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
cross-examination and so I won't do that
 
04:24:35.910 --> 04:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
all right um we have we have we're
 
04:24:39.349 --> 04:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
really running late so I'm going to have
 
04:24:40.830 --> 04:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative Penza and then H
 
04:24:43.149 --> 04:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
Haskins and hopefully we can go on to
 
04:24:46.269 --> 04:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:49.750 --> 04:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
testify um thank you madam chair sorry I
 
04:24:51.429 --> 04:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
came in late so I just have a couple
 
04:24:52.790 --> 04:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
questions because I'm reading over the
 
04:24:54.590 --> 04:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
bill I've got freeze-dried ice cream in
 
04:24:57.630 --> 04:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
front of me I'm quite confused so let me
 
04:25:00.469 --> 04:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
just um and I ate some of it under the
 
04:25:03.030 --> 04:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
table and uh please don't arrest me all
 
04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
right so um I want to understand um so I
 
04:25:10.910 --> 04:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
see right here if this is the you know
 
04:25:13.109 --> 04:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
the dark line food that is free dried
 
04:25:14.870 --> 04:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried shall not be considered
 
04:25:17.469 --> 04:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous food but that
 
04:25:20.429 --> 04:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
means that obviously if they have a
 
04:25:22.870 --> 04:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
homestead food license they are not
 
04:25:25.269 --> 04:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
making ice cream so it would have to be
 
04:25:26.790 --> 04:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
and someone mentioned this earlier I'm
 
04:25:29.070 --> 04:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
just this is a clarifying question that
 
04:25:31.550 --> 04:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
they would be buying let's say you know
 
04:25:33.870 --> 04:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
organic ice cream or something like that
 
04:25:35.950 --> 04:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
taking that into their Homestead in
 
04:25:38.349 --> 04:25:38.359 align:start position:0%
freeze drying it or whatever else that
 
04:25:39.870 --> 04:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
could be considered potentially
 
04:25:42.990 --> 04:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
hazardous correct
 
04:25:45.469 --> 04:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
it correct that it would allow them to
 
04:25:48.030 --> 04:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
take potentially hazardous products but
 
04:25:50.070 --> 04:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
they're not making the potentially
 
04:25:52.590 --> 04:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
hazardous product they like they're not
 
04:25:55.309 --> 04:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
making ice cream or you know they're not
 
04:25:57.510 --> 04:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
um slicing up pig or anything like that
 
04:26:00.469 --> 04:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
they're literally grabbing that already
 
04:26:02.670 --> 04:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
which is okay so I just wanted to make
 
04:26:05.630 --> 04:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
that clear so your your only concern is
 
04:26:09.189 --> 04:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
in the your concern is in the processing
 
04:26:12.349 --> 04:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
part of that is your concern in them
 
04:26:14.750 --> 04:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
Gathering stuff that has already been
 
04:26:16.389 --> 04:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
made and licensed in a commercial
 
04:26:18.109 --> 04:26:18.119 align:start position:0%
kitchen you don't have any problem with
 
04:26:18.119 --> 04:26:20.030 align:start position:0%
kitchen you don't have any problem with
that

04:26:20.030 --> 04:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:26:22.750 --> 04:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
correct thank you for the question so it
 
04:26:24.189 --> 04:26:24.199 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily about that it's
 
04:26:26.229 --> 04:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
been made in a commercial kitchen it's
 
04:26:28.870 --> 04:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
about the initial state of the product
 
04:26:32.030 --> 04:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
so ice cream is considered um
 
04:26:33.990 --> 04:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous it needs requires
 
04:26:36.309 --> 04:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
refrigeration for safety so when you
 
04:26:38.510 --> 04:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
take a a product that requires ref
 
04:26:40.389 --> 04:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
Refrigeration for safety whether it's
 
04:26:42.630 --> 04:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
commercially prepared or not and you
 
04:26:44.269 --> 04:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
turn it into a non-p potentially
 
04:26:47.189 --> 04:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
hazardous product that process is is the
 
04:26:47.199 --> 04:26:48.670 align:start position:0%
hazardous product that process is is the
concern

04:26:48.670 --> 04:26:48.680 align:start position:0%
concern
 
04:26:52.070 --> 04:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay okay clear represent H
 
04:26:54.469 --> 04:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
Haskins chair and thank you for taking
 
04:26:56.309 --> 04:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
my question like everyone on this
 
04:26:58.990 --> 04:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
committee I would desperately like to
 
04:27:03.630 --> 04:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
understand where we're stuck um so the
 
04:27:05.830 --> 04:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
process of making
 
04:27:09.910 --> 04:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
candy is allowed under a homestead
 
04:27:13.510 --> 04:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
license correct why because it's a non-p
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous product it's not
 
04:27:17.109 --> 04:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
something that requires refrigeration
 
04:27:19.510 --> 04:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
from safe for safety and we're not
 
04:27:21.630 --> 04:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
concerned about the risk of food born
 
04:27:24.109 --> 04:27:24.119 align:start position:0%
illness these are lowrisk products that
 
04:27:26.590 --> 04:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
are basically shelf stable so if you're
 
04:27:29.990 --> 04:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
taking a a lowrisk shelf stable product
 
04:27:32.109 --> 04:27:32.119 align:start position:0%
and you're freeze drying it there
 
04:27:34.189 --> 04:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
there's no concern there however if
 
04:27:35.950 --> 04:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
you're taking a potentially hazardous
 
04:27:37.870 --> 04:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
product that requires refrigeration for
 
04:27:40.070 --> 04:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
safety and you're turning it into a
 
04:27:42.189 --> 04:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
product that can be stored on the Shelf
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that that process
 
04:27:47.469 --> 04:27:47.479 align:start position:0%
that that takes it from non I'm sorry
 
04:27:49.229 --> 04:27:49.239 align:start position:0%
from potentially hazardous to non-p
 
04:27:51.070 --> 04:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous to make sure that
 
04:27:53.590 --> 04:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's achieved the proper water
 
04:27:56.429 --> 04:27:56.439 align:start position:0%
activity to be safe on the shelf and
 
04:28:00.469 --> 04:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
quick followup so I mean I I take a risk
 
04:28:05.429 --> 04:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
every time I determine whether I cut the
 
04:28:07.790 --> 04:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
chicken with that knife and I'm now
 
04:28:10.309 --> 04:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
going to do the apple is the cutting
 
04:28:12.830 --> 04:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
board you know I mean in food prep and
 
04:28:16.109 --> 04:28:16.119 align:start position:0%
when I eat at a restaurant I take my
 
04:28:20.710 --> 04:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
chances right so um I thought at first
 
04:28:23.670 --> 04:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
that we could exempt certain foods that
 
04:28:26.030 --> 04:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful CU these folks
 
04:28:28.710 --> 04:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to do turkey and all the rest
 
04:28:31.269 --> 04:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
but you're now talking about process
 
04:28:33.790 --> 04:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
right couldn't they go Ary in the
 
04:28:38.109 --> 04:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
process of freeze drying their
 
04:28:40.710 --> 04:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
candy because it's an already an
 
04:28:43.590 --> 04:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
inherently safe product to Candy there's
 
04:28:45.950 --> 04:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
there's there's there's not really risk
 
04:28:48.309 --> 04:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
for foodborn illness in candy so you're
 
04:28:51.109 --> 04:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
taking a a safe product and you're just
 
04:28:53.790 --> 04:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
changing the you're freeze drying it to
 
04:28:58.070 --> 04:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
make it a a different texture or um it's
 
04:29:01.510 --> 04:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
crunchier or bigger or you know whereas
 
04:29:05.109 --> 04:29:05.119 align:start position:0%
you're T if you're taking a a a product
 
04:29:08.189 --> 04:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
that's refrigerated for safety a
 
04:29:09.630 --> 04:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous product and you're
 
04:29:11.790 --> 04:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
making it non-p potentially hazardous
 
04:29:13.990 --> 04:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
there it's again it's that process of
 
04:29:16.309 --> 04:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
making it safe that is our concern thank
 
04:29:18.830 --> 04:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you any other questions
 
04:29:19.750 --> 04:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:29:23.630 --> 04:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
committee okay thank you thank you um
 
04:29:25.550 --> 04:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call Chris
 
04:29:29.109 --> 04:29:29.119 align:start position:0%
Norton to uh
 
04:29:31.309 --> 04:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
testify and I don't have any other pink
 
04:29:33.630 --> 04:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
cards after that so
 
04:29:38.070 --> 04:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh just let you know we're running late
 
04:29:40.790 --> 04:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
here uh good afternoon uh Madam chair
 
04:29:42.790 --> 04:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee
 
04:29:45.349 --> 04:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
um so I I know we're a bit late so I'll
 
04:29:48.109 --> 04:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
do my I'll do my best to keep it concise
 
04:29:52.349 --> 04:29:52.359 align:start position:0%
uh I'm here basically uh to uh testify
 
04:29:56.389 --> 04:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
in support of uh Bill 505 um and I want
 
04:29:59.389 --> 04:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
to give you a perspective of somebody
 
04:30:01.670 --> 04:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
who attempted to start their own small
 
04:30:04.630 --> 04:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
scale uh freeze-dried produce business
 
04:30:08.830 --> 04:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
last year uh so uh as I as I kind of uh
 
04:30:11.389 --> 04:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
go over this please keep in mind that my
 
04:30:13.910 --> 04:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
goal was to ultimately sell at a farmers
 
04:30:17.349 --> 04:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
market in Milford um and what this
 
04:30:20.109 --> 04:30:20.119 align:start position:0%
really boiled down to was in the spring
 
04:30:24.469 --> 04:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
of Summer of last year uh I started uh I
 
04:30:27.109 --> 04:30:27.119 align:start position:0%
basically started
 
04:30:30.870 --> 04:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
um working on creating a kind of a
 
04:30:34.950 --> 04:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
smallscale uh uh uh freeze-dried produce
 
04:30:37.269 --> 04:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
business where I would Source everything
 
04:30:39.870 --> 04:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
from local farmers so during the spring
 
04:30:42.030 --> 04:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
and summer I used that time to establish
 
04:30:44.550 --> 04:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
relationships with uh some local farmers
 
04:30:47.550 --> 04:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
in our area uh I would buy bulk produce
 
04:30:49.950 --> 04:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
from them and then bring that home and
 
04:30:52.189 --> 04:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
process it to kind of work out my
 
04:30:55.550 --> 04:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
procedures my processing um as I started
 
04:30:57.630 --> 04:30:57.640 align:start position:0%
to realize that I had what to me seemed
 
04:31:00.030 --> 04:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
like a viable business model what I
 
04:31:01.870 --> 04:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
decided to do was then reach out to the
 
04:31:03.950 --> 04:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:31:06.550 --> 04:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
because as their website States this is
 
04:31:07.950 --> 04:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
not something that's covered under
 
04:31:11.950 --> 04:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
current Homestead guidance uh so I had a
 
04:31:14.990 --> 04:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
incredibly good conversation with uh a
 
04:31:18.950 --> 04:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
woman named royan BOS uh who was just
 
04:31:21.349 --> 04:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
incredibly helpful in laying out
 
04:31:23.830 --> 04:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
everything I had to had to accomplish
 
04:31:27.030 --> 04:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
including creating um creating a hazard
 
04:31:30.870 --> 04:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
analysis plan um sending any any items
 
04:31:33.030 --> 04:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
that I produced off to Cornell to be
 
04:31:36.630 --> 04:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
tested for active water um and through
 
04:31:39.070 --> 04:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
all of that while it did seem like a lot
 
04:31:42.070 --> 04:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
again I am a fan of a good process I'm a
 
04:31:45.870 --> 04:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
I just really enjoy testing so I took
 
04:31:49.349 --> 04:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
that I took that went away and started
 
04:31:52.990 --> 04:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
um basically working on basically
 
04:31:54.469 --> 04:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
working on my own procedures within
 
04:31:59.550 --> 04:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
those guidelines uh and I want to make
 
04:32:03.429 --> 04:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
sure right and also as part of that um I
 
04:32:05.189 --> 04:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
worked with the manager of the Milford
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
Farmers Market who was able to find me a
 
04:32:09.109 --> 04:32:09.119 align:start position:0%
commissary kitchen that I could work out
 
04:32:11.630 --> 04:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
of the major downside to doing that
 
04:32:14.349 --> 04:32:14.359 align:start position:0%
house ever would be in order for me to
 
04:32:16.870 --> 04:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
operate under current guidance I would
 
04:32:18.309 --> 04:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
need to take all of my equipment
 
04:32:21.349 --> 04:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
including our freeze dryer move it into
 
04:32:23.950 --> 04:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
a commissary kitchen uh and that's where
 
04:32:26.429 --> 04:32:26.439 align:start position:0%
it would kind of reside and then uh
 
04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
something that hasn't been mentioned but
 
04:32:29.950 --> 04:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
the the length of time that these
 
04:32:32.630 --> 04:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
processes take uh is quite significant
 
04:32:34.590 --> 04:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
um the machine that we have at the
 
04:32:37.510 --> 04:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
moment in certain instances can
 
04:32:40.990 --> 04:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
take uh 24 to 48 hours to do an entire
 
04:32:42.389 --> 04:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
batch of produce
 
04:32:44.750 --> 04:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
so um I it's something that you know I
 
04:32:46.510 --> 04:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
could leave it up and running but these
 
04:32:48.750 --> 04:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
machines have issues sometimes I would
 
04:32:50.030 --> 04:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
have to constantly be going back and
 
04:32:52.630 --> 04:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
forth from our house to a to the
 
04:32:56.349 --> 04:32:56.359 align:start position:0%
commissary um and then from a monetary
 
04:32:57.990 --> 04:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint what I was essentially
 
04:33:00.870 --> 04:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
looking at uh again to sell these things
 
04:33:03.950 --> 04:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
at a farmers's market uh I was looking
 
04:33:06.990 --> 04:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
at a licensing fee of around $350 to be
 
04:33:10.189 --> 04:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
considered a food processing plant uh
 
04:33:12.429 --> 04:33:12.439 align:start position:0%
the items that I wanted to sell uh
 
04:33:15.269 --> 04:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
initially were uh apple chips
 
04:33:18.189 --> 04:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
raspberries blueberries and cherries uh
 
04:33:21.510 --> 04:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
I'm forgetting one but uh with with the
 
04:33:23.709 --> 04:33:23.719 align:start position:0%
setup and the fees associated with the
 
04:33:26.551 --> 04:33:26.561 align:start position:0%
testing that was around another $600
 
04:33:28.551 --> 04:33:28.561 align:start position:0%
that I was looking at in terms of just
 
04:33:32.629 --> 04:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
testing uh any changes to my recipes or
 
04:33:35.109 --> 04:33:35.119 align:start position:0%
my processes would necessitate another
 
04:33:36.910 --> 04:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
round of testing so that would be an
 
04:33:40.029 --> 04:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
additional cost um my wife likes to use
 
04:33:41.949 --> 04:33:41.959 align:start position:0%
an example of well what if I want wanted
 
04:33:44.189 --> 04:33:44.199 align:start position:0%
to use a different ratio of cinnamon on
 
04:33:45.590 --> 04:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things I would just look at
 
04:33:47.310 --> 04:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
her and say yep that means we're going
 
04:33:49.230 --> 04:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
to have to send it back into testing and
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
you know it's kind of a joke in our
 
04:33:55.109 --> 04:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
household um but overall uh what ended
 
04:33:58.109 --> 04:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
up happening was with all of this with
 
04:33:59.990 --> 04:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
all the procedures and all the guidance
 
04:34:01.910 --> 04:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh I was doing my best to kind of Chunk
 
04:34:05.551 --> 04:34:05.561 align:start position:0%
through it on my own um and what
 
04:34:08.510 --> 04:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately made me stop was or put it on
 
04:34:13.230 --> 04:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
pause I should say is um when I had
 
04:34:15.990 --> 04:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
created what I thought was a appropriate
 
04:34:18.990 --> 04:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
Hazard analysis plan I did send it back
 
04:34:20.510 --> 04:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
to Department of Health and Human
 
04:34:23.070 --> 04:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
Services and just to get some feedback
 
04:34:26.070 --> 04:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
and uh it was the feedback was great the
 
04:34:27.750 --> 04:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
only thing was is I effectively had
 
04:34:31.670 --> 04:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
created an outline um so what I needed
 
04:34:33.590 --> 04:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
to do was go back and create additional
 
04:34:36.429 --> 04:34:36.439 align:start position:0%
flowcharts to kind of show you know the
 
04:34:38.551 --> 04:34:38.561 align:start position:0%
potential things I could run into how I
 
04:34:41.470 --> 04:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
would mitigate them things like that um
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
and then in addition uh I found out a
 
04:34:46.709 --> 04:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
about a more efficient
 
04:34:49.869 --> 04:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
machine uh that would have that would
 
04:34:51.869 --> 04:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
have made my life a little bit easier
 
04:34:53.869 --> 04:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
would have increased increased my
 
04:34:56.990 --> 04:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
productivity uh however because it would
 
04:34:58.349 --> 04:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
be a new machine there would be The
 
04:35:00.590 --> 04:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
Upfront cost of that and then I quickly
 
04:35:02.349 --> 04:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
realized that I would also have to go
 
04:35:05.230 --> 04:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
back and I would have to redo all of the
 
04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh the processes and procedures that I
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
had done based on the old machine so
 
04:35:12.949 --> 04:35:12.959 align:start position:0%
it's I am in no ways sitting here
 
04:35:14.590 --> 04:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
telling you that I am defeated or I'm
 
04:35:16.910 --> 04:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
not going to continue along these lines
 
04:35:19.230 --> 04:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
but um it's just something that I had to
 
04:35:22.109 --> 04:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
stop and say okay let's re-evaluate you
 
04:35:23.429 --> 04:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
know how do I actually do this
 
04:35:26.510 --> 04:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
realistically as an individual um so
 
04:35:28.750 --> 04:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
that's why I am here in support of this
 
04:35:31.709 --> 04:35:31.719 align:start position:0%
bill uh largely because uh for me
 
04:35:33.789 --> 04:35:33.799 align:start position:0%
personally starting my own business is a
 
04:35:36.750 --> 04:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
dream of mine and this would be a good
 
04:35:39.070 --> 04:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
way for me to at least prove it as a
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
proof of concept um if I were to go go
 
04:35:43.869 --> 04:35:43.879 align:start position:0%
to a larger scale where I intend to sell
 
04:35:46.750 --> 04:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
at retail or across state lines that is
 
04:35:48.709 --> 04:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
a whole host of other procedures that I
 
04:35:51.310 --> 04:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely would abide by but for now as
 
04:35:54.551 --> 04:35:54.561 align:start position:0%
somebody who basically wants to support
 
04:35:58.349 --> 04:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
local farmers um support local farmers I
 
04:36:00.750 --> 04:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
very much am big on reducing food waste
 
04:36:03.629 --> 04:36:03.639 align:start position:0%
and also just looking for ways to give
 
04:36:06.189 --> 04:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
back to my community this would be a
 
04:36:09.189 --> 04:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
really good opportunity for me um the
 
04:36:11.029 --> 04:36:11.039 align:start position:0%
one last thing to mention as far as
 
04:36:12.269 --> 04:36:12.279 align:start position:0%
giving back
 
04:36:14.670 --> 04:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
uh over the past you know over the past
 
04:36:17.109 --> 04:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
year I've had uh a number of friends who
 
04:36:19.070 --> 04:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
have been impacted by natural disasters
 
04:36:21.590 --> 04:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
they've had their pantries ruined um and
 
04:36:24.470 --> 04:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
I've been able to take a significant
 
04:36:27.349 --> 04:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
amount of food put it in a relatively
 
04:36:30.070 --> 04:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
small box um and send that off to
 
04:36:31.670 --> 04:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
somebody you know send that off to
 
04:36:33.949 --> 04:36:33.959 align:start position:0%
somebody who is in generally in need of
 
04:36:37.150 --> 04:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
restocking their Pantry or um just need
 
04:36:39.109 --> 04:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
something that you know is going to be a
 
04:36:40.709 --> 04:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
little bit stable for a longer amount of
 
04:36:44.510 --> 04:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
time so um my representative uh
 
04:36:47.230 --> 04:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
representative uh Barber has submitted
 
04:36:50.029 --> 04:36:50.039 align:start position:0%
uh a written testimony to all of you um
 
04:36:51.629 --> 04:36:51.639 align:start position:0%
and I do apologize I've kind of been
 
04:36:54.670 --> 04:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
jumping around uh but um I'm happy to
 
04:36:56.109 --> 04:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
take any questions I do understand that
 
04:36:59.150 --> 04:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
we're running late y thank you thank you
 
04:37:01.551 --> 04:37:01.561 align:start position:0%
I appreciate uh I appreciate your
 
04:37:03.709 --> 04:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
testimony um we have questions from the
 
04:37:06.189 --> 04:37:06.199 align:start position:0%
committee representative barar thank you
 
04:37:08.029 --> 04:37:08.039 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you Chris for coming
 
04:37:11.750 --> 04:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh before us today um I have a a
 
04:37:13.910 --> 04:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
question about the
 
04:37:17.670 --> 04:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
process sure processes that you
 
04:37:20.830 --> 04:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
um worked on in order to develop your
 
04:37:23.789 --> 04:37:23.799 align:start position:0%
recipes did you make those up or did you
 
04:37:26.349 --> 04:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
find that um there was a resource for
 
04:37:28.869 --> 04:37:28.879 align:start position:0%
you to actually get those processes and
 
04:37:30.510 --> 04:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
did was it
 
04:37:34.629 --> 04:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
determin did they deter did the type of
 
04:37:39.230 --> 04:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
fruit matter which process you used so I
 
04:37:43.709 --> 04:37:43.719 align:start position:0%
it's a mix uh so what I did was because
 
04:37:46.029 --> 04:37:46.039 align:start position:0%
I had because I had contacted Health and
 
04:37:49.029 --> 04:37:49.039 align:start position:0%
Human Services I had a rough framework
 
04:37:50.789 --> 04:37:50.799 align:start position:0%
of what I should be operating under in
 
04:37:53.470 --> 04:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
terms of food safety handling things of
 
04:37:57.189 --> 04:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
that nature um in terms of the
 
04:38:00.310 --> 04:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
actual developing the actual processes
 
04:38:02.109 --> 04:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you that my process for
 
04:38:03.789 --> 04:38:03.799 align:start position:0%
making apple chips is completely
 
04:38:05.830 --> 04:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
different than the way I handle peaches
 
04:38:07.269 --> 04:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
it is also completely different than the
 
04:38:10.070 --> 04:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
way I handle cherries um all of those
 
04:38:12.390 --> 04:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
take different amounts of time
 
04:38:15.990 --> 04:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh in in the same machine so I know in
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
the case of something like uh in the
 
04:38:20.949 --> 04:38:20.959 align:start position:0%
case of something like a cherry I know
 
04:38:23.590 --> 04:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
that I have to pit it and after I pit it
 
04:38:25.150 --> 04:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
I know that I have to slice it so that I
 
04:38:27.510 --> 04:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
have enough surface area exposed that I
 
04:38:29.869 --> 04:38:29.879 align:start position:0%
can lay them all out nicely and then put
 
04:38:31.310 --> 04:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
them in the freeze dryer and then
 
04:38:33.510 --> 04:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of time to a certain
 
04:38:37.109 --> 04:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
amount and then I can be fairly sure
 
04:38:38.789 --> 04:38:38.799 align:start position:0%
because it hasn't been tested I can be
 
04:38:41.429 --> 04:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
fairly certain that those are um
 
04:38:44.310 --> 04:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
sufficiently freeze-dried but um again
 
04:38:46.109 --> 04:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
that would be what I would have needed
 
04:38:48.510 --> 04:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
to send them off for testing for
 
04:38:48.520 --> 04:38:50.629 align:start position:0%
to send them off for testing for
followup

04:38:50.629 --> 04:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
followup
 
04:38:53.390 --> 04:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
so um I guess maybe I didn't ask my
 
04:38:55.109 --> 04:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
question correctly Sor is this
 
04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
information on how how you process the
 
04:39:03.349 --> 04:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
fruit Y how long you dehydrate what the
 
04:39:08.150 --> 04:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
um the um moisture content is is that
 
04:39:10.990 --> 04:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
something you created or did you have
 
04:39:11.000 --> 04:39:12.109 align:start position:0%
something you created or did you have
guidance

04:39:12.109 --> 04:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
04:39:14.789 --> 04:39:14.799 align:start position:0%
and where can someone find that guidance
 
04:39:18.429 --> 04:39:18.439 align:start position:0%
for that so typically typically if we if
 
04:39:20.470 --> 04:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
you're looking for a more official type
 
04:39:22.551 --> 04:39:22.561 align:start position:0%
of guidance there is a user manual that
 
04:39:24.629 --> 04:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
typically comes with all machines it
 
04:39:26.470 --> 04:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
does give you recommended settings for
 
04:39:29.390 --> 04:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
certain types of things that is usually
 
04:39:31.029 --> 04:39:31.039 align:start position:0%
or in my case that's what we use as a
 
04:39:33.590 --> 04:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
starting point and then the the devils
 
04:39:35.510 --> 04:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
in the details when you start you know
 
04:39:38.990 --> 04:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
expanding on that um for what it's worth
 
04:39:41.030 --> 04:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
there are online communities that you
 
04:39:45.030 --> 04:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
know to share knowledge but um you know
 
04:39:46.430 --> 04:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
that is something that everyone's
 
04:39:48.150 --> 04:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
experience is going to be different but
 
04:39:53.190 --> 04:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:56.670 --> 04:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
resource any other questions from the
 
04:39:59.990 --> 04:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
committee no seeing none thank you very
 
04:40:03.270 --> 04:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
much for your time um for all the folks
 
04:40:05.470 --> 04:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
who have come in uh and I guess you're
 
04:40:08.910 --> 04:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
looking to uh uh for the hearing for HB
 
04:40:10.910 --> 04:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
396 we are I just want to let you know
 
04:40:13.070 --> 04:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
we are running about a half hour
 
04:40:16.628 --> 04:40:16.638 align:start position:0%
late uh after we close out this hearing
 
04:40:18.708 --> 04:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
uh we have one more another hearing
 
04:40:21.948 --> 04:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
before uh HB 396 so I just want
 
04:40:24.030 --> 04:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
everybody to kind of know where we are

are there any other pink cards anyone
 
04:40:32.628 --> 04:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
else who wishes to speak on HB
 
04:40:35.670 --> 04:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
505 seeing none I'd like the blue sheet
 
04:40:39.310 --> 04:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
please for uh HB

opposition and zero people neutral on
 
04:40:56.708 --> 04:40:56.718 align:start position:0%

after thank you yes I I shall do that
 
04:42:32.070 --> 04:42:32.080 align:start position:0%

04:42:48.590 --> 04:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
have discussed
 
04:42:51.390 --> 04:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
for freeze-dried
 
04:42:55.230 --> 04:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
food I'm bringing forth this uh Bill
 
04:42:57.430 --> 04:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
allowing the sale of dehydrated meat
 
04:42:59.990 --> 04:43:00.000 align:start position:0%

license
 
04:43:05.590 --> 04:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today to introduce this
 
04:43:08.708 --> 04:43:08.718 align:start position:0%
bill I filed this bill in response to a
 
04:43:11.110 --> 04:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
constituent who raises beef and who
 
04:43:13.390 --> 04:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
would like to sell dehydrated meat that
 
04:43:15.470 --> 04:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
he already makes for his family and
 
04:43:17.868 --> 04:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
friends none of his family or friends
 
04:43:19.910 --> 04:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
have ever gotten ill from consuming his
 
04:43:19.920 --> 04:43:20.788 align:start position:0%
have ever gotten ill from consuming his
beef

04:43:20.788 --> 04:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
beef
 
04:43:24.510 --> 04:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
jerky the process of drying meat takes a
 
04:43:27.070 --> 04:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous food and makes it
 
04:43:30.310 --> 04:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
into a shelf stable product according to
 
04:43:34.628 --> 04:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
USDA publication which I have um passed
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:41.110 --> 04:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
everybody um dehydrated meat or as we
 
04:43:44.070 --> 04:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
commonly know it as jerky is a food
 
04:43:46.868 --> 04:43:46.878 align:start position:0%
known since at least ancient Egypt
 
04:43:48.910 --> 04:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
humans made jerky from animal meat that
 
04:43:51.470 --> 04:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
was too big to eat all at once such as
 
04:43:54.350 --> 04:43:54.360 align:start position:0%

countries how can drying meat make it
 
04:44:11.430 --> 04:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
safe drying is the world's oldest and
 
04:44:14.150 --> 04:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
most common method of food preservation
 
04:44:16.510 --> 04:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
canning technology is less than 200
 
04:44:18.830 --> 04:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
years old and freezing only became
 
04:44:20.990 --> 04:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
practical during this century when
 
04:44:22.990 --> 04:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
electricity became more available to
 
04:44:26.190 --> 04:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
people drying technology is both simple
 
04:44:28.070 --> 04:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
and readily available to most of the
 
04:44:28.080 --> 04:44:29.070 align:start position:0%
and readily available to most of the
world's

04:44:29.070 --> 04:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
world's
 
04:44:31.510 --> 04:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
culture the scientific principle of
 
04:44:34.030 --> 04:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
preserving preserving food by drying is
 
04:44:37.430 --> 04:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
that by removing moisture enzymes cannot
 
04:44:39.868 --> 04:44:39.878 align:start position:0%
efficiently contact or react with the
 
04:44:42.708 --> 04:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
food whether these enzymes are bacterial
 
04:44:45.390 --> 04:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
fungal or naturally occurring autolytic
 
04:44:47.788 --> 04:44:47.798 align:start position:0%
enzymes from raw food preventing this
 
04:44:50.270 --> 04:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
enzymatic action preserves the food from
 
04:44:53.070 --> 04:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
biological action in the interest of
 
04:44:55.430 --> 04:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
providing more WS for New Hampshire
 
04:44:58.110 --> 04:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
Farmers to offer more diverse food
 
04:45:00.670 --> 04:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
products to New Hampshire consumers I
 
04:45:02.150 --> 04:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
think this bill would be a welcome
 
04:45:04.110 --> 04:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
addition to what can be sold at Farm
 
04:45:06.948 --> 04:45:06.958 align:start position:0%
stands and farmers markets and it isn't
 
04:45:09.110 --> 04:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
necessary for producers to have
 
04:45:11.110 --> 04:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchens or licenser to
 
04:45:12.750 --> 04:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
produce this
 
04:45:15.430 --> 04:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
product I've produced this product in my
 
04:45:18.788 --> 04:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
in my home with my own dehydrator
 
04:45:21.230 --> 04:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
machines the bill sets standards for
 
04:45:23.350 --> 04:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
production and those standards can be
 
04:45:25.470 --> 04:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
reinforced by information provided on
 
04:45:27.788 --> 04:45:27.798 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Service website
 
04:45:29.708 --> 04:45:29.718 align:start position:0%
just as other guidelines are provided to
 
04:45:31.910 --> 04:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
producers thereby minimizing risk or
 
04:45:34.948 --> 04:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
foodborn illness we could require people
 
04:45:36.750 --> 04:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
who produce these foods to take a class
 
04:45:39.510 --> 04:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
on food safety it if that is the will of
 
04:45:41.868 --> 04:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:45:43.708 --> 04:45:43.718 align:start position:0%
in drafting this bill I know that there
 
04:45:46.190 --> 04:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
were some errors that need some fixing
 
04:45:48.470 --> 04:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm prepared to draft any amendment
 
04:45:50.190 --> 04:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
to make those
 
04:45:53.230 --> 04:45:53.240 align:start position:0%
adjustments one of which was on line
 
04:45:57.708 --> 04:45:57.718 align:start position:0%
five on page one which talks about um
 
04:46:00.628 --> 04:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
USDA USDA inspected meat that has been
 
04:46:02.830 --> 04:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried without a homestead food
 
04:46:06.030 --> 04:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
license um it should not be freeze-dried
 
04:46:09.910 --> 04:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
it should be um just un USDA inspected
 
04:46:13.550 --> 04:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
meat um um originally when I drafted
 
04:46:17.990 --> 04:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
this bill I made this bill to be
 
04:46:20.750 --> 04:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
allowing dehydrated meat as well as
 
04:46:24.628 --> 04:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried products and because
 
04:46:27.590 --> 04:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative shamberg had a bill
 
04:46:30.990 --> 04:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
coming in to OS with freeze-dried
 
04:46:34.030 --> 04:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
products mentioned OS contacted me and
 
04:46:35.910 --> 04:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
said uh we're we're not going to put
 
04:46:39.230 --> 04:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
your bill in and I said well then just
 
04:46:41.310 --> 04:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
strip out the freeze drying part and let
 
04:46:45.190 --> 04:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
his be an independent Bill and have mine
 
04:46:46.868 --> 04:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
and so that's kind of where we are but
 
04:46:48.670 --> 04:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
apparently the drafter didn't take out
 
04:46:50.948 --> 04:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
the freeze-dried part so we would have
 
04:46:55.510 --> 04:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
to amend the bill to fix that um the
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
other thing was that my intention was to
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
limit the amount of meat processed and
 
04:47:02.350 --> 04:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
sold within a time period which was left
 
04:47:04.868 --> 04:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
out of this bill draft too I had
 
04:47:06.910 --> 04:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
originally wanted to add that people
 
04:47:08.708 --> 04:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
can't sell more than 10 pounds of
 
04:47:10.430 --> 04:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
post-processed weight of their product
 
04:47:11.590 --> 04:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
in a week
 
04:47:13.190 --> 04:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
and may not produce more than three
 
04:47:16.190 --> 04:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
pounds of post produ processed meat in a
 
04:47:19.230 --> 04:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
in a day so I I put some limitations in
 
04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
there just because I felt that you know
 
04:47:24.830 --> 04:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
we don't want to have people be you know
 
04:47:28.470 --> 04:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
these hu a homestead become this huge
 
04:47:31.350 --> 04:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
business um a commercial you know big
 
04:47:33.910 --> 04:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
commercial kind of entity I wanted to
 
04:47:35.750 --> 04:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
kind of keep it small and also by
 
04:47:38.350 --> 04:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
keeping it small it's more
 
04:47:40.670 --> 04:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
controllable there's a little bit more
 
04:47:43.548 --> 04:47:43.558 align:start position:0%
um risk management that you can you can
 
04:47:46.390 --> 04:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
wrap your hands around so that's the
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
intention of this particular um Bill uh
 
04:47:53.270 --> 04:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
I mentioned in it um you know the
 
04:47:56.708 --> 04:47:56.718 align:start position:0%
process by which uh a person would be
 
04:48:01.030 --> 04:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
able to uh produce dehydrated meat I've
 
04:48:02.788 --> 04:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
taken that right from the
 
04:48:04.590 --> 04:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
USDA uh
 
04:48:08.350 --> 04:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
website um what they recommend um that
 
04:48:10.830 --> 04:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
you know how how the meat has to be
 
04:48:13.350 --> 04:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
refrigerated to a certain degrees uh
 
04:48:15.868 --> 04:48:15.878 align:start position:0%
meat would have to be steamed or roasted
 
04:48:17.590 --> 04:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
to certain degrees before it is
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
dehydrated in order to kill any kind of
 
04:48:23.750 --> 04:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
um you know bacteria or or
 
04:48:26.510 --> 04:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
organisms and
 
04:48:30.030 --> 04:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
um and that's basically it so um I'd be
 
04:48:32.948 --> 04:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
happy to entertain questions um I don't
 
04:48:35.830 --> 04:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
believe that my constituent is here who
 
04:48:38.470 --> 04:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
actually does this but I ran this bill
 
04:48:40.150 --> 04:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
by him and he says yeah this is what I
 
04:48:41.590 --> 04:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
do and
 
04:48:43.110 --> 04:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
um you know I've been able to make it
 
04:48:45.310 --> 04:48:45.320 align:start position:0%
very safe and I'd be happy to abide by
 
04:48:48.590 --> 04:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
these rules if they are made uh into law
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative Jama J thank
 
04:48:53.948 --> 04:48:53.958 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you
 
04:48:55.708 --> 04:48:55.718 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
04:48:56.990 --> 04:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
get to call you representative when
 
04:49:00.030 --> 04:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
you're sitting over there uh I've been
 
04:49:00.040 --> 04:49:01.590 align:start position:0%
you're sitting over there uh I've been
demoted

04:49:01.590 --> 04:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
demoted
 
04:49:05.030 --> 04:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
right only temporarily uh so if I have a
 
04:49:06.390 --> 04:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
question then if I'm permitted to follow
 
04:49:07.788 --> 04:49:07.798 align:start position:0%
up just for
 
04:49:10.750 --> 04:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
clarification uh uh at line nine page
 
04:49:13.110 --> 04:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
one line9 the the meat is refrigerated
 
04:49:17.190 --> 04:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
at 40° fah or slightly below I'm a
 
04:49:20.948 --> 04:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
little confused by what slightly means
 
04:49:22.788 --> 04:49:22.798 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering what the temperature range
 
04:49:24.670 --> 04:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
it's just a clarification question yeah
 
04:49:26.910 --> 04:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
sure well you know I just grabbed the
 
04:49:29.510 --> 04:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
the language verbatim from the USDA
 
04:49:31.910 --> 04:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
website so I mean you know if if we want
 
04:49:34.070 --> 04:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
to be a little bit more precise or
 
04:49:38.030 --> 04:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
strike that entirely or put a range of
 
04:49:41.270 --> 04:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
of uh degrees uh I'd be happy to
 
04:49:42.830 --> 04:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
especially since I know we're going to
 
04:49:45.390 --> 04:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
have to if we want to proceed with this
 
04:49:47.470 --> 04:49:47.480 align:start position:0%
um do some kind of amendments to the to
 
04:49:49.470 --> 04:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
the bill anyway because there's issues
 
04:49:52.548 --> 04:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
with it may I have followup followup
 
04:49:53.628 --> 04:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
thank you and I appreciate that because
 
04:49:55.030 --> 04:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if it might be a range
 
04:49:56.230 --> 04:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
because I literally don't know if
 
04:49:58.150 --> 04:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
slightly in this case is a degree or
 
04:49:59.670 --> 04:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
three right right right but so I
 
04:50:01.390 --> 04:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate that y uh and then just for
 
04:50:04.750 --> 04:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
my clarification at line four meet is is
 
04:50:06.750 --> 04:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
marinated only in the refrigerator I
 
04:50:09.750 --> 04:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
take that to mean that it is stored in a
 
04:50:12.270 --> 04:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
Refrigerated unit while it is marinating
 
04:50:13.750 --> 04:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
as opposed to being left out marinating
 
04:50:15.670 --> 04:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
at room temperature yes okay thank you
 
04:50:17.670 --> 04:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
very much that's the safe procedure
 
04:50:19.628 --> 04:50:19.638 align:start position:0%
protocol which is recommended y I
 
04:50:21.030 --> 04:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
thought just wanted the clarification
 
04:50:21.040 --> 04:50:22.708 align:start position:0%
thought just wanted the clarification
thank

04:50:22.708 --> 04:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:50:26.590 --> 04:50:26.600 align:start position:0%
you represent King thank you madam chair
 
04:50:28.868 --> 04:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
um I have a question that's a little bit
 
04:50:31.510 --> 04:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
more philosophical I I hope I hope I can
 
04:50:33.670 --> 04:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
ask this it's appropriate
 
04:50:36.510 --> 04:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
but we're getting a lot of bills similar
 
04:50:38.830 --> 04:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
to this vein
 
04:50:42.350 --> 04:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
and it's like for for a long time the
 
04:50:45.190 --> 04:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
food production industry has been
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
heavily corporatized
 
04:50:50.470 --> 04:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
centralized and these types of bills are
 
04:50:53.708 --> 04:50:53.718 align:start position:0%
really helping to decentralize that um
 
04:50:57.030 --> 04:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
democratize it if you will and I feel
 
04:50:59.310 --> 04:50:59.320 align:start position:0%
like with it being
 
04:51:02.390 --> 04:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
centralized um you know you're getting
 
04:51:03.590 --> 04:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
most of the time you're getting a
 
04:51:06.788 --> 04:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
standard product things seem to be safe
 
04:51:09.868 --> 04:51:09.878 align:start position:0%
but it really it really prevents the
 
04:51:11.990 --> 04:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
little guy from competing in that market
 
04:51:14.590 --> 04:51:14.600 align:start position:0%
unless they already have Deep Pockets
 
04:51:17.190 --> 04:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
and if we have bills like these come
 
04:51:19.350 --> 04:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
about it seems like it definitely gives
 
04:51:22.750 --> 04:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
the little guy a chance but do we do we
 
04:51:25.110 --> 04:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
lose something do you do we lose is
 
04:51:27.310 --> 04:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
there is there is there a risk that we
 
04:51:29.270 --> 04:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
previously didn't have that we would be
 
04:51:30.548 --> 04:51:30.558 align:start position:0%
having if we
 
04:51:33.510 --> 04:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
started allowing the little guy who
 
04:51:36.270 --> 04:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
maybe doesn't have as Deepa pocts uh
 
04:51:38.670 --> 04:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
pockets for lawsuits or whatever what do
 
04:51:41.110 --> 04:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
you think the downside is of
 
04:51:43.590 --> 04:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
letting the little guy get a a foot in
 
04:51:46.150 --> 04:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
the door in in this regard I actually
 
04:51:48.310 --> 04:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
don't think there is a downside I mean
 
04:51:51.830 --> 04:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
we saw uh during covid uh empty shelves
 
04:51:53.750 --> 04:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
in the supermarket where the
 
04:51:56.030 --> 04:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
corporations were the ones that could
 
04:51:59.430 --> 04:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
not provide food for us and and we had a
 
04:52:02.070 --> 04:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
lot of people who were seeking Foods
 
04:52:05.830 --> 04:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
locally from our local farmers and I I I
 
04:52:11.350 --> 04:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
think we sort of got this um Epiphany
 
04:52:14.750 --> 04:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
that we have people who are absolutely
 
04:52:17.590 --> 04:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
capable in our local communities to
 
04:52:20.830 --> 04:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
producing these things and um producing
 
04:52:24.510 --> 04:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
them even in in a very ethical and very
 
04:52:29.310 --> 04:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
um Common Sense way and carefully and
 
04:52:31.750 --> 04:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
mindfully because they live in these
 
04:52:34.948 --> 04:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
communities they deal with the the their
 
04:52:38.788 --> 04:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
neighbors their friends um I
 
04:52:43.750 --> 04:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:48.830 --> 04:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
um creating more opportunity for our
 
04:52:51.910 --> 04:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
Farmers is nothing but a win situation
 
04:52:54.670 --> 04:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
for everybody because there's more food
 
04:52:56.310 --> 04:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
in our system being
 
04:52:59.788 --> 04:52:59.798 align:start position:0%
produced um and there's more opportunity
 
04:53:03.590 --> 04:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
for smaller entrepreneurs to offer
 
04:53:09.628 --> 04:53:09.638 align:start position:0%
diverse product to uh to offer more
 
04:53:10.948 --> 04:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
things to more people
 
04:53:13.708 --> 04:53:13.718 align:start position:0%
people um and then you know to
 
04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative Miner's point before in
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony I mean we see these
 
04:53:22.110 --> 04:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
big corporations uh who are under great
 
04:53:25.070 --> 04:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
scrutiny and you know being inspected
 
04:53:28.190 --> 04:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
all the time there's recalls every day
 
04:53:31.270 --> 04:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
for you know Bor head baloney or
 
04:53:35.150 --> 04:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
whatever Smithfield's ribs or whatever
 
04:53:38.230 --> 04:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
and peanut butter anything um because
 
04:53:38.240 --> 04:53:39.430 align:start position:0%
and peanut butter anything um because
they're

04:53:39.430 --> 04:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:53:42.030 --> 04:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
not they're they're contaminated or
 
04:53:44.150 --> 04:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
tainted in one way or another or
 
04:53:47.430 --> 04:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
perceived as being tainted or whatever
 
04:53:49.708 --> 04:53:49.718 align:start position:0%
and I think you know there's a lot to be
 
04:53:52.868 --> 04:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
said for um a little bit more local
 
04:53:54.470 --> 04:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
control and
 
04:53:57.548 --> 04:53:57.558 align:start position:0%
local um involvement in the food that
 
04:53:57.558 --> 04:54:00.030 align:start position:0%
local um involvement in the food that
we're

04:54:00.030 --> 04:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:02.110 --> 04:54:02.120 align:start position:0%
consuming thank you representative for
 
04:54:05.070 --> 04:54:05.080 align:start position:0%
being here and bringing this bill forth
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
would you say that New Hampshire has a
 
04:54:10.708 --> 04:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
large cottage industry
 
04:54:12.670 --> 04:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
I would say we do and I'd like to
 
04:54:15.390 --> 04:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
encourage further growth of that okay
 
04:54:18.990 --> 04:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
and and because it's such a uh huge
 
04:54:22.110 --> 04:54:22.120 align:start position:0%
cottage industry State
 
04:54:25.708 --> 04:54:25.718 align:start position:0%
um the foot people finding out about bad
 
04:54:31.270 --> 04:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
products is pretty quick and uh tracking
 
04:54:32.868 --> 04:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
something where someone got sick is
 
04:54:36.230 --> 04:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
probably a lot quicker than uh a large
 
04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
National Corporation uh that
 
04:54:40.750 --> 04:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
disseminates tens of thousands of pounds
 
04:54:44.470 --> 04:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
of product at a time um would you say
 
04:54:46.990 --> 04:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
that being able to trace a product in
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or someone getting sick uh
 
04:54:51.310 --> 04:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
you would know exactly where it's uh
 
04:54:53.510 --> 04:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
coming from rather quickly and it could
 
04:54:56.788 --> 04:54:56.798 align:start position:0%
be eliminated um and if there was a bad
 
04:54:59.270 --> 04:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
actor would that spread quickly so that
 
04:55:00.868 --> 04:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
no one would then purchase from that
 
04:55:02.910 --> 04:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
person yes and I think we've seen that
 
04:55:05.110 --> 04:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
with our raw milk
 
04:55:09.310 --> 04:55:09.320 align:start position:0%
legislation um so yeah I mean I I think
 
04:55:11.470 --> 04:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
that uh you certainly Word of Mouth gets
 
04:55:13.270 --> 04:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
around pretty quick if you have somebody
 
04:55:15.948 --> 04:55:15.958 align:start position:0%
who's producing something that's subpar
 
04:55:17.670 --> 04:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be in business very
 
04:55:22.030 --> 04:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
long um I you know and I also made
 
04:55:25.110 --> 04:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
provision in this bill uh for labeling
 
04:55:27.390 --> 04:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
you know that that um you know you have
 
04:55:29.628 --> 04:55:29.638 align:start position:0%
to have certain information on your
 
04:55:33.628 --> 04:55:33.638 align:start position:0%
product label um and the there would
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
have to be signage where where the point
 
04:55:38.350 --> 04:55:38.360 align:start position:0%
of sale is uh regarding the name of the
 
04:55:40.750 --> 04:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
meat producers business
 
04:55:42.670 --> 04:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
the email address the phone number the
 
04:55:45.190 --> 04:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
name of the product and a statement to
 
04:55:46.990 --> 04:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
say that dehydrated meat and meat
 
04:55:48.708 --> 04:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
products from this meat producer
 
04:55:51.430 --> 04:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
distributor are made with USDA inspected
 
04:55:53.110 --> 04:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
meat and are exempt from New Hampshire
 
04:55:55.270 --> 04:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
licensing and inspection so there is an
 
04:55:57.350 --> 04:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
element of allowing and letting the
 
04:56:00.150 --> 04:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
customer know where this is coming from
 
04:56:01.670 --> 04:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
who's produced it where it's been
 
04:56:04.590 --> 04:56:04.600 align:start position:0%
produced and because they're buying it
 
04:56:06.110 --> 04:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
from their producer they can ask
 
04:56:08.750 --> 04:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
questions about the process they're
 
04:56:10.430 --> 04:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
actually right there with the people who
 
04:56:12.670 --> 04:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
are making the product and being able to
 
04:56:15.788 --> 04:56:15.798 align:start position:0%
say what is in this how did you make it
 
04:56:19.030 --> 04:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
so they can feel better or or more
 
04:56:21.910 --> 04:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
secure you you don't get to ask those
 
04:56:24.230 --> 04:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
questions when you know you're buying a
 
04:56:27.030 --> 04:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
package of Hillshire Farm bacon or
 
04:56:30.590 --> 04:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
whatever so uh I I I don't know I I just
 
04:56:33.190 --> 04:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
think um you know even as we are
 
04:56:35.548 --> 04:56:35.558 align:start position:0%
promoting eat local support our local
 
04:56:38.270 --> 04:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
farms this bill and some of the other
 
04:56:40.910 --> 04:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
food bills that we've been uh dealing
 
04:56:44.470 --> 04:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
with absolutely do do
 
04:56:47.230 --> 04:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
that any other questions from the
 
04:56:50.868 --> 04:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:54.990 --> 04:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:56:58.910 --> 04:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um just a did
 
04:57:00.470 --> 04:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
this bill comment is do you feel that
 
04:57:02.270 --> 04:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is like timely for everything
 
04:57:05.510 --> 04:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's kind of going on um you know on
 
04:57:06.990 --> 04:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
the federal government side in our
 
04:57:09.548 --> 04:57:09.558 align:start position:0%
country right now how we're trying to
 
04:57:12.990 --> 04:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
turn back to the local and small farmers
 
04:57:15.390 --> 04:57:15.400 align:start position:0%
because it seems as if um corporate
 
04:57:17.510 --> 04:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
Farmers have have taken over and it's
 
04:57:19.750 --> 04:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
been going on for a long time so we're
 
04:57:21.548 --> 04:57:21.558 align:start position:0%
definitely behind the eightball um do
 
04:57:23.230 --> 04:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
you think that this could help one New
 
04:57:27.990 --> 04:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is my first question and um do
 
04:57:29.350 --> 04:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
you believe that there's like further
 
04:57:31.430 --> 04:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
things that we could do in New Hampshire
 
04:57:34.910 --> 04:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
outside of um you know outside of this
 
04:57:38.270 --> 04:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
bill to be able to promote that that
 
04:57:41.910 --> 04:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
that local you know local Homestead food
 
04:57:46.270 --> 04:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
producing um that seems as if our new uh
 
04:57:49.430 --> 04:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
Secretary of HHS is is pushing towards
 
04:57:52.590 --> 04:57:52.600 align:start position:0%
as well um on the federal
 
04:57:54.470 --> 04:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
level well I don't know about the
 
04:57:56.750 --> 04:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
federal level but I certainly do think
 
04:57:59.470 --> 04:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
that you know this is this is a big uh
 
04:58:02.350 --> 04:58:02.360 align:start position:0%
Boon this would be a big Boon to our uh
 
04:58:04.990 --> 04:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
agricultural community in New Hampshire
 
04:58:06.788 --> 04:58:06.798 align:start position:0%
would help our local farmers it would
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
help them become more diverse in the
 
04:58:10.750 --> 04:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
products that they're able to to offer
 
04:58:12.230 --> 04:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
to their local
 
04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
customers and um I I just think that you
 
04:58:18.510 --> 04:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
know overall yeah uh and people do want
 
04:58:21.110 --> 04:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
to get back to I don't want to say you
 
04:58:23.510 --> 04:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
know the old ways of doing things but
 
04:58:25.548 --> 04:58:25.558 align:start position:0%
you know in the olden days yeah you went
 
04:58:28.670 --> 04:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
to your local Farmer for whatever cuts
 
04:58:35.310 --> 04:58:35.320 align:start position:0%
of meat or bacon or smoked smoked items
 
04:58:38.788 --> 04:58:38.798 align:start position:0%
um any any produce that they that they
 
04:58:41.510 --> 04:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
grew and you knew where where your food
 
04:58:44.430 --> 04:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
was being uh raised and you knew how it
 
04:58:47.190 --> 04:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
was being raised uh and I think that
 
04:58:51.788 --> 04:58:51.798 align:start position:0%
people really want to have that again um
 
04:58:54.910 --> 04:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm all for big corporate
 
04:58:57.150 --> 04:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
business and God bless them let them let
 
04:59:00.070 --> 04:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
them make whatever money and and produce
 
04:59:02.350 --> 04:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
their products but I think there's
 
04:59:02.360 --> 04:59:03.390 align:start position:0%
their products but I think there's
there's

04:59:03.390 --> 04:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:59:07.830 --> 04:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
also a part of us that wants to be close
 
04:59:11.150 --> 04:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
to where we live and and be comfortable
 
04:59:13.750 --> 04:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
with what our local farmers are doing
 
04:59:17.350 --> 04:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
and support them and uh this is another
 
04:59:19.070 --> 04:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
way in which we can do that with
 
04:59:20.350 --> 04:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
especially with the food bills that
 
04:59:22.868 --> 04:59:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:25.390 --> 04:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
considering seeing no other questions
 
04:59:27.310 --> 04:59:27.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'd like to call

04:59:51.270 --> 04:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
public health protection within the
 
04:59:53.110 --> 04:59:53.120 align:start position:0%

04:59:56.670 --> 04:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
Erica Davis and she's the food
 
04:59:58.868 --> 04:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
protection section administrator with
 
04:59:59.948 --> 04:59:59.958 align:start position:0%

Services and she's going to provide the
 
05:00:05.110 --> 05:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
testimony for us today good
 
05:00:08.830 --> 05:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon so House Bill 642 would create
 
05:00:12.548 --> 05:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
an exemption under our a 143 A5 to allow
 
05:00:15.590 --> 05:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
for dehydrated meat to be uh produced
 
05:00:17.670 --> 05:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
without a homestead license this
 
05:00:19.548 --> 05:00:19.558 align:start position:0%
testimony is going to be very similar to
 
05:00:22.628 --> 05:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
the free stride um food testimony as the
 
05:00:24.110 --> 05:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
processes are
 
05:00:27.190 --> 05:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
similar so we currently do not allow for
 
05:00:28.990 --> 05:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
dehydrated Meats to be preserved in a
 
05:00:31.670 --> 05:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
homestead food operation the only
 
05:00:33.430 --> 05:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
products that may be produced in a
 
05:00:35.430 --> 05:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
licensed or exempt Homestead food
 
05:00:37.110 --> 05:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
operation would be non potentially
 
05:00:40.070 --> 05:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
hazardous food products dehydration is a
 
05:00:42.110 --> 05:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
specialized process whereby the water
 
05:00:44.548 --> 05:00:44.558 align:start position:0%
activity is reduced in a product to
 
05:00:50.110 --> 05:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:52.788 --> 05:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
microorganisms this process should be
 
05:00:55.030 --> 05:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
done in a commercial facility with
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
commercial equipment and have a process
 
05:01:00.070 --> 05:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
Authority evaluate the product and the
 
05:01:04.190 --> 05:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:07.350 --> 05:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
sale for this bill without the ability
 
05:01:09.270 --> 05:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
to license or inspect there would be no
 
05:01:09.280 --> 05:01:10.548 align:start position:0%
to license or inspect there would be no
oversight

05:01:10.548 --> 05:01:10.558 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
05:01:13.070 --> 05:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh to ensure that meats are you are from
 
05:01:16.310 --> 05:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
a USDA inspected Source there's no way
 
05:01:17.430 --> 05:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
there would be no way for us to
 
05:01:20.230 --> 05:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
ascertain how many facilities may be
 
05:01:23.070 --> 05:01:23.080 align:start position:0%
conducting this process and without with
 
05:01:24.670 --> 05:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
this lack of oversight it could hinder
 
05:01:27.190 --> 05:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
the Department's ability to conduct the
 
05:01:29.150 --> 05:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
necessary foodborn illness outbreak
 
05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
investigation should there be one and
 
05:01:34.030 --> 05:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
potentially restri restrict our ability
 
05:01:36.548 --> 05:01:36.558 align:start position:0%
to trace back products to the source
 
05:01:40.070 --> 05:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
again I'd like to point to the 2013
 
05:01:43.590 --> 05:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
outbreak for chicken jerky pet treats
 
05:01:47.390 --> 05:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
which resulted in U 43
 
05:01:49.948 --> 05:01:49.958 align:start position:0%
illnesses and I can take any
 
05:01:52.708 --> 05:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
questions should you have
 
05:01:57.788 --> 05:01:57.798 align:start position:0%
them any questions represent Bixby so um
 
05:02:00.310 --> 05:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
would you be more uh comfortable with
 
05:02:02.830 --> 05:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
his bill if it were using a licensed
 
05:02:02.840 --> 05:02:04.510 align:start position:0%
his bill if it were using a licensed
Homestead

05:02:04.510 --> 05:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
Homestead
 
05:02:07.430 --> 05:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
kitchen thank you for the question um it
 
05:02:11.150 --> 05:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
still is it still is a commercially I
 
05:02:13.830 --> 05:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
mean excuse me it still is a potentially
 
05:02:15.990 --> 05:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
hazardous product that's
 
05:02:18.990 --> 05:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
being through the process of dehydration
 
05:02:20.590 --> 05:02:20.600 align:start position:0%
turned into a non-p potentially
 
05:02:22.948 --> 05:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
hazardous product so it is a specialized
 
05:02:26.190 --> 05:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
process of a meat product which we would
 
05:02:30.150 --> 05:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:36.190 --> 05:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
and uh so um would you
 
05:02:39.868 --> 05:02:39.878 align:start position:0%
um uh one of the things that we did when
 
05:02:45.910 --> 05:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
when we uh started allowing the sale of
 
05:02:49.310 --> 05:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
um uh poultry and rabbits to restaurants
 
05:02:54.150 --> 05:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
was we set up a course uh at um through
 
05:02:57.350 --> 05:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh Co-op extension to give people the
 
05:02:59.788 --> 05:02:59.798 align:start position:0%
training to do that would you be for
 
05:03:02.430 --> 05:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with this ex W with
 
05:03:05.788 --> 05:03:05.798 align:start position:0%
this exception to the potentially
 
05:03:09.548 --> 05:03:09.558 align:start position:0%
hazardous uh food product uh restriction
 
05:03:13.310 --> 05:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
if if there were uh uh a course um that
 
05:03:14.948 --> 05:03:14.958 align:start position:0%
people someone could go through in order
 
05:03:19.150 --> 05:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
to become uh qualified to do
 
05:03:22.430 --> 05:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
this thank you
 
05:03:24.750 --> 05:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
I I think that any educational
 
05:03:28.350 --> 05:03:28.360 align:start position:0%
requirement is a help um to producers um
 
05:03:30.990 --> 05:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
who are taking on a specialized process
 
05:03:33.070 --> 05:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
however it does
 
05:03:35.910 --> 05:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
not help with the specific product
 
05:03:39.310 --> 05:03:39.320 align:start position:0%
itself so when we ask for a dehydrated
 
05:03:41.750 --> 05:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
meat product to go through a process
 
05:03:45.470 --> 05:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
evaluation to ensure that the farmer
 
05:03:49.230 --> 05:03:49.240 align:start position:0%
specific process and marinades and um
 
05:03:51.788 --> 05:03:51.798 align:start position:0%
dehydration of the product meets those
 
05:03:54.990 --> 05:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
standards the education may not Point
 
05:03:58.628 --> 05:03:58.638 align:start position:0%
directly to their process okay thank
 
05:04:02.868 --> 05:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
you if I may add please um because a
 
05:04:05.548 --> 05:04:05.558 align:start position:0%
process review allows for the experts in
 
05:04:08.110 --> 05:04:08.120 align:start position:0%
that particular area to weigh in in
 
05:04:11.110 --> 05:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
terms of how to to do it safely and
 
05:04:13.548 --> 05:04:13.558 align:start position:0%
properly the process that's really a a
 
05:04:16.190 --> 05:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
concern so the education is is good but
 
05:04:19.990 --> 05:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't um uh take the place of a
 
05:04:24.868 --> 05:04:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:27.430 --> 05:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
Penza um thank you madam chair thank you
 
05:04:30.110 --> 05:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
for my question so I don't know if you
 
05:04:32.390 --> 05:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
have the bill in front of you but um
 
05:04:36.750 --> 05:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
like right in the beginning on line four
 
05:04:40.270 --> 05:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't it put the agencies mind at
 
05:04:42.270 --> 05:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
ease because it right there at the
 
05:04:44.150 --> 05:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
beginning says a meat producer
 
05:04:47.070 --> 05:04:47.080 align:start position:0%
distributor who has licensed to sell
 
05:04:51.150 --> 05:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
USDA inspected meat may sell USDA
 
05:04:52.270 --> 05:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
inspected meat that has been
 
05:04:54.990 --> 05:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried wouldn't that right there
 
05:04:58.628 --> 05:04:58.638 align:start position:0%
because of we know um what you have to
 
05:05:00.830 --> 05:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
go through in regards with
 
05:05:03.628 --> 05:05:03.638 align:start position:0%
that be enough thank you for the
 
05:05:07.990 --> 05:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
question so the USDA inspected meat is
 
05:05:10.948 --> 05:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
meat that's been SL watered and
 
05:05:14.670 --> 05:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
packaged in a USDA facility so that raw
 
05:05:16.868 --> 05:05:16.878 align:start position:0%
product that comes with the stamp from
 
05:05:20.708 --> 05:05:20.718 align:start position:0%
USDA but then there this in this bill
 
05:05:24.350 --> 05:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
they would be taking that product and
 
05:05:26.948 --> 05:05:26.958 align:start position:0%
dehydrating it to make another product
 
05:05:28.510 --> 05:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
so you're taking it a potentially
 
05:05:30.150 --> 05:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
hazardous meat product and turning it
 
05:05:32.470 --> 05:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
into a non-p potentially hazardous shelf
 
05:05:32.480 --> 05:05:37.190 align:start position:0%
into a non-p potentially hazardous shelf
stable

05:05:37.190 --> 05:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:40.190 --> 05:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
product represent Jama
 
05:05:41.350 --> 05:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
05:05:43.590 --> 05:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if I recall
 
05:05:45.510 --> 05:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
correctly there was one of the concerns
 
05:05:47.230 --> 05:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
you expressed was about if there's an
 
05:05:49.868 --> 05:05:49.878 align:start position:0%
outbreak tracking outbreaks and and so
 
05:05:52.510 --> 05:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the labeling requirements
 
05:05:54.628 --> 05:05:54.638 align:start position:0%
here it's a it's a freeze stried package
 
05:05:56.350 --> 05:05:56.360 align:start position:0%
that contains information about the
 
05:05:57.788 --> 05:05:57.798 align:start position:0%
producer and the
 
05:06:00.310 --> 05:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
distributor wouldn't that help the
 
05:06:03.590 --> 05:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
department pretty thoroughly track down
 
05:06:05.350 --> 05:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
potentially tainted products the
 
05:06:07.628 --> 05:06:07.638 align:start position:0%
labeling requirements in the Bill thank
 
05:06:09.708 --> 05:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
05:06:12.110 --> 05:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
it would if they're adhering to those
 
05:06:14.350 --> 05:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
standards and without licensing or
 
05:06:16.110 --> 05:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
inspection we have no way to evaluate
 
05:06:20.070 --> 05:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
the labeling so we would if the labeling
 
05:06:23.990 --> 05:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
is improper or incomplete it can lead to
 
05:06:27.110 --> 05:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
difficulty tracing back uh product I
 
05:06:30.430 --> 05:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
have followup follow up thank you so and
 
05:06:32.830 --> 05:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with how the process of
 
05:06:35.430 --> 05:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
investigating these concerns work so but
 
05:06:37.510 --> 05:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
what I I would imagine is if somebody
 
05:06:38.788 --> 05:06:38.798 align:start position:0%
there's there's an outbreak there's an
 
05:06:40.070 --> 05:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
illness it's report reped you
 
05:06:43.430 --> 05:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
investigate it you find you know
 
05:06:46.310 --> 05:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
packaging um are you able to then you
 
05:06:48.788 --> 05:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
know test the product and be able to
 
05:06:52.788 --> 05:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
determine at that point if it was not
 
05:06:56.670 --> 05:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
dehydrated or or packaged
 
05:06:59.910 --> 05:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
correctly if it's deter
 
05:07:02.750 --> 05:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
if if we have a foodborn illness
 
05:07:06.990 --> 05:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
outbreak and there is a common product
 
05:07:09.270 --> 05:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
associated with the illness we can test
 
05:07:14.510 --> 05:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
the product to um link it back to the
 
05:07:16.868 --> 05:07:16.878 align:start position:0%
illnesses and if all the pieces fall
 
05:07:18.350 --> 05:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
into place
 
05:07:21.788 --> 05:07:21.798 align:start position:0%
properly we can track it back and this
 
05:07:25.110 --> 05:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
the illness um outbreak that we
 
05:07:27.910 --> 05:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
presented You is kind of the The Perfect
 
05:07:31.830 --> 05:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
Storm we were able to um
 
05:07:34.670 --> 05:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
identify uh the ill individuals the
 
05:07:37.470 --> 05:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
product where it came from link it back
 
05:07:40.270 --> 05:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
and Link the illness um
 
05:07:42.270 --> 05:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
the the product to the ill individuals
 
05:07:44.708 --> 05:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
so it was kind of a full circle outbreak
 
05:07:46.868 --> 05:07:46.878 align:start position:0%
investigations which don't
 
05:07:50.830 --> 05:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
always illness outbreaks don't always um
 
05:07:53.350 --> 05:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
end in the the perfect wrap
 
05:07:56.470 --> 05:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
up okay thank you for the
 
05:07:58.868 --> 05:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
clarification any other questions seeing
 
05:08:01.670 --> 05:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much I appreciate it
 
05:08:03.070 --> 05:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
I represent Miner could I get the blue
 
05:08:11.430 --> 05:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:13.990 --> 05:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
online there are seven in support and
 
05:08:19.990 --> 05:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:24.190 --> 05:08:24.200 align:start position:0%
sheet zero so I will close the hearing
 
05:08:38.150 --> 05:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:42.750 --> 05:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:42.760 --> 05:08:45.990 align:start position:0%
 
here's

05:08:45.990 --> 05:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:46.000 --> 05:08:53.830 align:start position:0%
 
this

05:08:53.830 --> 05:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:57.470 --> 05:08:57.480 align:start position:0%

05:10:22.990 --> 05:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
a bill that's near and dear to my heart
 
05:10:24.510 --> 05:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
especially in the farming Community to
 
05:10:27.070 --> 05:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
help small farmers and hobby
 
05:10:29.430 --> 05:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
Farmers this bill has been brought about
 
05:10:32.350 --> 05:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
and I understand that this bill will
 
05:10:34.310 --> 05:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
need some
 
05:10:36.230 --> 05:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
amending there'll need to be some
 
05:10:38.750 --> 05:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
labeling requirements and there may need
 
05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
to be some limits so I just want you to
 
05:10:45.708 --> 05:10:45.718 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that uh I'm hoping that
 
05:10:47.510 --> 05:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
this committee will work to make this
 
05:10:49.230 --> 05:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
the best build possible to help all of
 
05:10:49.240 --> 05:10:52.230 align:start position:0%
the best build possible to help all of
our

05:10:52.230 --> 05:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:55.510 --> 05:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
Farmers right now in New
 
05:10:59.190 --> 05:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in order to sell a cut of meat
 
05:11:00.430 --> 05:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
either from
 
05:11:00.440 --> 05:11:03.350 align:start position:0%
either from
beef

05:11:03.350 --> 05:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
beef
 
05:11:06.190 --> 05:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
swine sheep or
 
05:11:08.830 --> 05:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
goat you have to go through a USDA
 
05:11:08.840 --> 05:11:09.830 align:start position:0%
goat you have to go through a USDA
process

05:11:09.830 --> 05:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:11:12.310 --> 05:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
facility and if you do go through that
 
05:11:14.430 --> 05:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
USDA processing facility and you want to
 
05:11:17.708 --> 05:11:17.718 align:start position:0%
say sell smoked bacon and you take it to
 
05:11:21.270 --> 05:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
a Smokehouse that is not USDA inspected
 
05:11:23.670 --> 05:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
you cannot sell that bacon as USDA and
 
05:11:26.030 --> 05:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
cannot sell that to your
 
05:11:28.390 --> 05:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
consumer so I just want everyone to be
 
05:11:31.788 --> 05:11:31.798 align:start position:0%
aware of the nuances of the
 
05:11:34.590 --> 05:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
law right now there's a year and a half
 
05:11:37.390 --> 05:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
to two-year waiting list at all USDA
 
05:11:39.910 --> 05:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
facilities in New Hampshire
 
05:11:42.470 --> 05:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay I believe uh Conway just opened up
 
05:11:44.470 --> 05:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
again we were down to three I believe
 
05:11:46.830 --> 05:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
we're up to four
 
05:11:51.070 --> 05:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
again these Farmers have to set dates
 
05:11:54.150 --> 05:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
well in advance of even knowing when the
 
05:11:56.150 --> 05:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
animal will be
 
05:11:59.708 --> 05:11:59.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:02.708 --> 05:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
processing we we've heard I've been on
 
05:12:05.510 --> 05:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
several study committees it's like well
 
05:12:06.830 --> 05:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
you know the farmers don't know how to
 
05:12:08.590 --> 05:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
plan out they have all their processing
 
05:12:11.708 --> 05:12:11.718 align:start position:0%
done at one time that is not
 
05:12:11.718 --> 05:12:13.270 align:start position:0%
done at one time that is not
true

05:12:13.270 --> 05:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
true
 
05:12:15.548 --> 05:12:15.558 align:start position:0%
farmers understand the business it is a
 
05:12:20.788 --> 05:12:20.798 align:start position:0%
247 7-Day A Week business and it's hard
 
05:12:22.788 --> 05:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
and we need to give them the opportunity
 
05:12:25.390 --> 05:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
not only them but the consumer who
 
05:12:27.948 --> 05:12:27.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to buy a half a cow or a
 
05:12:30.670 --> 05:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
quarter of a cow they want to buy a
 
05:12:33.230 --> 05:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
steak and why shouldn't they be able to
 
05:12:35.788 --> 05:12:35.798 align:start position:0%
get that from their local farmer whom
 
05:12:39.270 --> 05:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:43.030 --> 05:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
we've heard today about USDA
 
05:12:46.270 --> 05:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
recalls I'm telling right now just in
 
05:12:47.948 --> 05:12:47.958 align:start position:0%
January alone at one place it was a
 
05:12:52.070 --> 05:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
177,000 lb sausage recall contaminated
 
05:12:53.750 --> 05:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
with foreign
 
05:12:57.750 --> 05:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
materials processed at a USDA
 
05:13:02.470 --> 05:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
facility January 2025 105,000
 
05:13:05.270 --> 05:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
PBS of frozen chicken
 
05:13:07.270 --> 05:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
products because of misbranding and
 
05:13:11.110 --> 05:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
Undeclared allerin at a USDA
 
05:13:14.510 --> 05:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
facility I can go on there was one place
 
05:13:18.150 --> 05:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
called Bruce Pac almost 10 million
 
05:13:20.990 --> 05:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:21.000 --> 05:13:24.628 align:start position:0%
 
meat

05:13:24.628 --> 05:13:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:26.470 --> 05:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
recalled I don't think that New
 
05:13:30.750 --> 05:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:33.628 --> 05:13:33.638 align:start position:0%
that the other thing is what people have
 
05:13:37.350 --> 05:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
to understand is having raised animals
 
05:13:39.628 --> 05:13:39.638 align:start position:0%
myself having had them both processed at
 
05:13:42.990 --> 05:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
a USDA facility or at a custom Meat Shop
 
05:13:47.030 --> 05:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:50.350 --> 05:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
choosing the safety the cleanliness at
 
05:13:52.110 --> 05:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
the custom Meat
 
05:13:55.110 --> 05:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
Shops I get to go in I get to decide if
 
05:13:56.868 --> 05:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
that's where I wanted my meat processed
 
05:13:58.628 --> 05:13:58.638 align:start position:0%
at a USDA facility you don't get to
 
05:14:00.390 --> 05:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
decide where you want it done you have
 
05:14:01.708 --> 05:14:01.718 align:start position:0%
to set that appointment a year and a
 
05:14:03.868 --> 05:14:03.878 align:start position:0%
half to two years in
 
05:14:06.350 --> 05:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
advance just
 
05:14:09.510 --> 05:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
recently I had to call the USDA to do a
 
05:14:14.430 --> 05:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
surprise inspection at a local USDA
 
05:14:17.230 --> 05:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
facility because of things that should
 
05:14:21.270 --> 05:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
not have been done I have photographs I
 
05:14:22.470 --> 05:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
have not filed the Freedom of
 
05:14:25.510 --> 05:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
Information Act yet but I
 
05:14:30.310 --> 05:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
will this one farmer got back freezer
 
05:14:30.320 --> 05:14:31.548 align:start position:0%
will this one farmer got back freezer
bured

05:14:31.548 --> 05:14:31.558 align:start position:0%
bured
 
05:14:35.510 --> 05:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
meat brought it back to the USDA
 
05:14:37.708 --> 05:14:37.718 align:start position:0%
facility they slapped another Farm's
 
05:14:39.510 --> 05:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
label on top of that and so sold it to
 
05:14:43.070 --> 05:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
that another Farm how did we catch that
 
05:14:45.750 --> 05:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:49.270 --> 05:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
consumer a consumer was the one that
 
05:14:51.190 --> 05:14:51.200 align:start position:0%
peeled back the label and wanted to know
 
05:14:54.548 --> 05:14:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:59.548 --> 05:14:59.558 align:start position:0%
on as we spoke about in previously we
 
05:15:02.750 --> 05:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
are a small state we are a cottage
 
05:15:05.910 --> 05:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
industry someone does something wrong
 
05:15:08.110 --> 05:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
everybody knows about it if there's a
 
05:15:09.990 --> 05:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
shop that's processed ing meat and it's
 
05:15:13.030 --> 05:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
not good nobody will go
 
05:15:15.390 --> 05:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
there but yet when it comes to
 
05:15:17.510 --> 05:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
processing cuts of meat for the consumer
 
05:15:19.150 --> 05:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have
 
05:15:22.150 --> 05:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
choices it's one of four places that's
 
05:15:25.230 --> 05:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
it if you want to sell a
 
05:15:29.310 --> 05:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
cut I don't think that's right I think
 
05:15:31.470 --> 05:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
as consumers we are smart enough to know
 
05:15:34.070 --> 05:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
where we want to buy our local food I
 
05:15:36.390 --> 05:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
don't think that you know for USA
 
05:15:39.030 --> 05:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
facilities is sustainable to our feet
 
05:15:39.040 --> 05:15:40.190 align:start position:0%
facilities is sustainable to our feet
food

05:15:40.190 --> 05:15:40.200 align:start position:0%
food
 
05:15:43.030 --> 05:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
Movement we need more food processing
 
05:15:45.070 --> 05:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
and more places to get local food in the
 
05:15:48.070 --> 05:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so that we become
 
05:15:50.070 --> 05:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
more food
 
05:15:53.470 --> 05:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
secure I'm happy to take questions okay
 
05:15:56.230 --> 05:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you for that
 
05:15:57.590 --> 05:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for your
 
05:15:59.470 --> 05:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
testimony today I don't know much about
 
05:16:01.868 --> 05:16:01.878 align:start position:0%
this but I've heard complaints of um
 
05:16:04.948 --> 05:16:04.958 align:start position:0%
family friends we have who raise beef
 
05:16:06.788 --> 05:16:06.798 align:start position:0%
and and they say they really understand
 
05:16:09.110 --> 05:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
beef and they know how to raise
 
05:16:10.470 --> 05:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
different types of beef like for example
 
05:16:13.350 --> 05:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
Kobe and stuff like that and um there's
 
05:16:13.360 --> 05:16:14.150 align:start position:0%
Kobe and stuff like that and um there's
been

05:16:14.150 --> 05:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:16:17.190 --> 05:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
murmurings that they believe um they've
 
05:16:20.350 --> 05:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
had their meat um replaced by other
 
05:16:22.350 --> 05:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
people's meat like you know they'll
 
05:16:24.150 --> 05:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
they'll send in their meat and it comes
 
05:16:25.548 --> 05:16:25.558 align:start position:0%
back and they're like this isn't Kobe
 
05:16:27.670 --> 05:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
beef at all you know or like they feel
 
05:16:29.070 --> 05:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
like their meat has been stolen from
 
05:16:31.350 --> 05:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
them and given inferior meat do you
 
05:16:32.990 --> 05:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
think that's a problem and how do you
 
05:16:34.628 --> 05:16:34.638 align:start position:0%
even prove something like that or is
 
05:16:37.310 --> 05:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
that just I don't know what do you have
 
05:16:39.390 --> 05:16:39.400 align:start position:0%
to say about that so repes pres thank
 
05:16:40.708 --> 05:16:40.718 align:start position:0%
you very much for the
 
05:16:43.030 --> 05:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
question I have heard that on numerous
 
05:16:44.830 --> 05:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
occasions not only have I heard that I
 
05:16:46.708 --> 05:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
had one farmer go in and take a picture
 
05:16:47.990 --> 05:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
of a meat
 
05:16:50.110 --> 05:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
cooler where there was not enough air
 
05:16:52.708 --> 05:16:52.718 align:start position:0%
flow in the cooler and they were
 
05:16:54.750 --> 05:16:54.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about the the degradation of
 
05:16:54.760 --> 05:16:56.830 align:start position:0%
concerned about the the degradation of
their

05:16:56.830 --> 05:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:17:01.510 --> 05:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
meat so thank you yeah um representative
 
05:17:03.708 --> 05:17:03.718 align:start position:0%
Bixby Penza and then
 
05:17:10.110 --> 05:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
germana okay so um is the problem of um
 
05:17:13.070 --> 05:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
having your H having the the wrong meat
 
05:17:14.948 --> 05:17:14.958 align:start position:0%
returned to you strictly a problem with
 
05:17:16.948 --> 05:17:16.958 align:start position:0%
the USDA plant or does that happen at
 
05:17:18.830 --> 05:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
custom plants too that if that custom
 
05:17:20.310 --> 05:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
plant is not
 
05:17:22.110 --> 05:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
well-run thank you for the question
 
05:17:25.750 --> 05:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby um I am going to
 
05:17:27.670 --> 05:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
assume that that is very possible that
 
05:17:29.830 --> 05:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
could happen at a custom plant but this
 
05:17:33.230 --> 05:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
I do know for a fact um because it was
 
05:17:35.110 --> 05:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention as I said I have
 
05:17:35.120 --> 05:17:35.830 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention as I said I have
the

05:17:35.830 --> 05:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:17:38.430 --> 05:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
pictures so I can speak factually to
 
05:17:38.440 --> 05:17:40.548 align:start position:0%
pictures so I can speak factually to
that

05:17:40.548 --> 05:17:40.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:17:42.750 --> 05:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
05:17:45.788 --> 05:17:45.798 align:start position:0%
Penza um thank you madam chair and thank
 
05:17:47.430 --> 05:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question just as a
 
05:17:49.948 --> 05:17:49.958 align:start position:0%
follow-up to representative King I've
 
05:17:53.788 --> 05:17:53.798 align:start position:0%
actually heard that now three times
 
05:17:58.628 --> 05:17:58.638 align:start position:0%
um we bought uh half of a cow or
 
05:18:02.350 --> 05:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
whatever one uh one year and
 
05:18:05.110 --> 05:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
um and these people they're experts they
 
05:18:07.868 --> 05:18:07.878 align:start position:0%
know exactly from what they're feeding
 
05:18:10.190 --> 05:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
their meat and how it looks and all of
 
05:18:15.948 --> 05:18:15.958 align:start position:0%
that and um and so many of um many
 
05:18:17.788 --> 05:18:17.798 align:start position:0%
places because they've had to be able to
 
05:18:22.150 --> 05:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
do that they can they've had to um um in
 
05:18:25.110 --> 05:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
a sense get multiple people to buy you
 
05:18:27.310 --> 05:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
know what I mean because you to try to
 
05:18:30.070 --> 05:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
get away from the S USDA piece or
 
05:18:32.510 --> 05:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
whatever but um I was um appalled when I
 
05:18:35.070 --> 05:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
heard that I haven't heard anything like
 
05:18:36.910 --> 05:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
that from local farmers or local meat
 
05:18:39.628 --> 05:18:39.638 align:start position:0%
producers that are still having to to do
 
05:18:41.670 --> 05:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
that at all so I just kind of wanted you
 
05:18:44.628 --> 05:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
to speak to that piece too where did
 
05:18:46.230 --> 05:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
where have you heard that I've heard
 
05:18:50.070 --> 05:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
that in um in my area up in straford
 
05:18:53.590 --> 05:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
county and I've heard it um actually in
 
05:18:55.948 --> 05:18:55.958 align:start position:0%
Coos uh thank you for the question so
 
05:18:59.750 --> 05:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
I've heard it uh one from some Farmers I
 
05:19:02.750 --> 05:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
mean let's face it if you have 300 you
 
05:19:07.470 --> 05:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
know whatever how many you know beef are
 
05:19:09.750 --> 05:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
hanging in the cool
 
05:19:11.350 --> 05:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
you know and they're not labeled
 
05:19:13.470 --> 05:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
correctly you could mislabel something
 
05:19:15.470 --> 05:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
or you could say oh you're supposed to
 
05:19:18.190 --> 05:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
get this much meat from this cow but
 
05:19:20.430 --> 05:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
there's some mold or there's this on it
 
05:19:22.070 --> 05:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
so now we're going to take it from the
 
05:19:24.350 --> 05:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
next cow because there's acceptable
 
05:19:29.190 --> 05:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
limit mounts um so yes uh do I believe
 
05:19:32.030 --> 05:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
that is happening yes uh do I think that
 
05:19:36.150 --> 05:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
it's all places no I I would never cast
 
05:19:39.230 --> 05:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
everybody in that group um
 
05:19:41.190 --> 05:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
because some people actually follow
 
05:19:43.110 --> 05:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
everything to the letter and others
 
05:19:45.350 --> 05:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
don't that's kind of like saying all
 
05:19:47.788 --> 05:19:47.798 align:start position:0%
custom Meat Shops are meat processes are
 
05:19:50.470 --> 05:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
great and all of them are bad it's never
 
05:19:52.548 --> 05:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
that way it's you have the good and the
 
05:19:53.590 --> 05:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
bad in
 
05:19:56.270 --> 05:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
everything okay representative germana
 
05:19:59.230 --> 05:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
and then Scully thank you madam chair
 
05:20:00.910 --> 05:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
05:20:03.030 --> 05:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
question I'm not nearly as knowledgeable
 
05:20:05.150 --> 05:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
about the agricultural side of things as
 
05:20:08.110 --> 05:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of my colleagues are um my my
 
05:20:10.270 --> 05:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
sense is when we look at these kinds of
 
05:20:12.150 --> 05:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
bills and we're talking about
 
05:20:15.310 --> 05:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
exemptions one of the criteria that we
 
05:20:18.390 --> 05:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
use is scale in terms of when it gets
 
05:20:20.310 --> 05:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
above a certain scale this is where we
 
05:20:22.350 --> 05:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
start to be concerned about inspections
 
05:20:24.390 --> 05:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
so as I'm looking at this bill I'm
 
05:20:25.910 --> 05:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
hoping you can help me understand I see
 
05:20:28.030 --> 05:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
the the distribution to household
 
05:20:29.708 --> 05:20:29.718 align:start position:0%
consumers within the state you can go
 
05:20:31.868 --> 05:20:31.878 align:start position:0%
buy something directly from the producer
 
05:20:33.190 --> 05:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
what I'm wondering about I'm hoping you
 
05:20:35.788 --> 05:20:35.798 align:start position:0%
can speak to is number two restaurants
 
05:20:37.990 --> 05:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
hotels boarding houses grocery stores or
 
05:20:41.190 --> 05:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
other establ L Ms are at that point are
 
05:20:44.190 --> 05:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
we talking about a scale where we start
 
05:20:46.510 --> 05:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
to be concerned about inspection because
 
05:20:48.510 --> 05:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
if a hotel is buying it for their
 
05:20:50.430 --> 05:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
restaurant and they may buy from two or
 
05:20:53.788 --> 05:20:53.798 align:start position:0%
three different producers it strikes me
 
05:20:55.750 --> 05:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
that there's a larger likelihood that
 
05:20:57.390 --> 05:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
there if there is an outbreak it's going
 
05:20:59.270 --> 05:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
to be more difficult to determine which
 
05:21:01.390 --> 05:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
source it comes from and that's a
 
05:21:03.110 --> 05:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
problem for tracing it so could you help
 
05:21:04.910 --> 05:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
me understand especially that part of
 
05:21:06.548 --> 05:21:06.558 align:start position:0%
the bill and if we get to a point where
 
05:21:09.470 --> 05:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
scale is an issue so I appreciate the
 
05:21:11.670 --> 05:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
question and as I said right off the bat
 
05:21:12.990 --> 05:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
that I believe that this needed to be
 
05:21:15.110 --> 05:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
amended and scale is part of that
 
05:21:18.150 --> 05:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment so and I would let listen to
 
05:21:20.070 --> 05:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
the people that are in favor of this
 
05:21:22.628 --> 05:21:22.638 align:start position:0%
bill the Farmers on what they think is
 
05:21:25.190 --> 05:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh in a year because I don't
 
05:21:27.548 --> 05:21:27.558 align:start position:0%
this is not going to be card blanch uh
 
05:21:29.310 --> 05:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be selling on a large
 
05:21:32.548 --> 05:21:32.558 align:start position:0%
scale then you know this is not the bill
 
05:21:35.070 --> 05:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
for you this is for the small tah harby
 
05:21:37.708 --> 05:21:37.718 align:start position:0%
farmer thank you very much he U
 
05:21:40.390 --> 05:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative Scully and then Bixby and
 
05:21:43.150 --> 05:21:43.160 align:start position:0%
then grber thank you madam chair um are
 
05:21:47.350 --> 05:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
there s more facilities available that
 
05:21:49.708 --> 05:21:49.718 align:start position:0%
are State inspected and regulated that
 
05:21:51.990 --> 05:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
that would be now open if we're able to
 
05:21:54.270 --> 05:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
pass this legislation uh thank you for
 
05:21:56.430 --> 05:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
the question we
 
05:21:59.470 --> 05:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
do if we were to be in state inspect you
 
05:22:02.030 --> 05:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
can either be USDA inspected or state or
 
05:22:03.670 --> 05:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
you can have a state inspection program
 
05:22:06.510 --> 05:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
but usually not both in the same state
 
05:22:08.548 --> 05:22:08.558 align:start position:0%
and the cost to be a state inspected prr
 
05:22:11.270 --> 05:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
program is pretty prohibitive and not
 
05:22:12.830 --> 05:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
only that is the requirements would have
 
05:22:15.110 --> 05:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
to be the same as the USDA or more
 
05:22:19.548 --> 05:22:19.558 align:start position:0%
stringent so it doesn't make sense to do
 
05:22:23.030 --> 05:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
that followup followup okay so I mean
 
05:22:25.430 --> 05:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
there are good people doing this but
 
05:22:27.548 --> 05:22:27.558 align:start position:0%
they're at this point they're they're
 
05:22:29.788 --> 05:22:29.798 align:start position:0%
not being regulated by if this was
 
05:22:31.150 --> 05:22:31.160 align:start position:0%
passed they wouldn't be regulated by
 
05:22:33.548 --> 05:22:33.558 align:start position:0%
anybody uh you're just relying on their
 
05:22:35.788 --> 05:22:35.798 align:start position:0%
their good practices and and people
 
05:22:37.070 --> 05:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
knowing whether they're doing it right
 
05:22:38.830 --> 05:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
or not well well thank thank you for
 
05:22:42.708 --> 05:22:42.718 align:start position:0%
that so there are many places people
 
05:22:43.750 --> 05:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
that are
 
05:22:48.110 --> 05:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
selling Whole cows whole pigs half pigs
 
05:22:50.110 --> 05:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
that are not going to a USDA facility
 
05:22:53.270 --> 05:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
and selling selling the the product and
 
05:22:55.190 --> 05:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
having the meat processed and there's no
 
05:22:58.788 --> 05:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
issues we don't hear of any issues going
 
05:23:01.230 --> 05:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
on the thing is is they just can't sell
 
05:23:01.240 --> 05:23:02.110 align:start position:0%
on the thing is is they just can't sell
a

05:23:02.110 --> 05:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:23:07.910 --> 05:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
cut thank you welcome Bixby yeah so um
 
05:23:11.350 --> 05:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
it seems like the one of the issues here
 
05:23:14.190 --> 05:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
is that there simply Aren't Enough
 
05:23:17.868 --> 05:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
USDA uh licensed facilities in the State
 
05:23:21.628 --> 05:23:21.638 align:start position:0%
uh which in one on one level doesn't
 
05:23:23.750 --> 05:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
create the kind kind of competition that
 
05:23:26.470 --> 05:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
would make it uh difficult for someone
 
05:23:29.628 --> 05:23:29.638 align:start position:0%
who is if if there were like 30
 
05:23:31.350 --> 05:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
facilities in the state then the one who
 
05:23:33.590 --> 05:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
is doing things really badly would lose
 
05:23:36.030 --> 05:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
out from comp from the competition and
 
05:23:37.990 --> 05:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
that kind of pressure is not present
 
05:23:40.510 --> 05:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
here so what are the impediments to
 
05:23:43.548 --> 05:23:43.558 align:start position:0%
someone starting a USDA facility in the
 
05:23:45.750 --> 05:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
State uh thank you very much for the
 
05:23:48.470 --> 05:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
question well uh representative Bixby a
 
05:23:50.990 --> 05:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
lot of the people uh that have chosen
 
05:23:54.310 --> 05:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
not to go the USDA route is one cash
 
05:23:56.030 --> 05:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
flow obviously is
 
05:24:00.350 --> 05:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
one the amount of paperwork and uh some
 
05:24:02.230 --> 05:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
of these processes as we've heard in the
 
05:24:04.670 --> 05:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
past have actually worked for USDA
 
05:24:06.990 --> 05:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
facilities uh they understand the
 
05:24:08.830 --> 05:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
regulations they understand what's going
 
05:24:10.990 --> 05:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
on they have told us the
 
05:24:11.000 --> 05:24:13.310 align:start position:0%
on they have told us the
stories

05:24:13.310 --> 05:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
stories
 
05:24:18.390 --> 05:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
and they feel that they don't have to
 
05:24:20.628 --> 05:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
just have because you have a USDA
 
05:24:22.590 --> 05:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
inspector on site doesn't mean you're
 
05:24:25.510 --> 05:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
doing things right as I just
 
05:24:29.510 --> 05:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
testified and I think that is the Crux
 
05:24:30.948 --> 05:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
of the issue right just because
 
05:24:32.948 --> 05:24:32.958 align:start position:0%
something is USDA doesn't mean you're
 
05:24:35.868 --> 05:24:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:38.868 --> 05:24:38.878 align:start position:0%
quality okay representative guber
 
05:24:40.510 --> 05:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:24:43.910 --> 05:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
Panza right yes okay can I get it
 
05:24:46.270 --> 05:24:46.280 align:start position:0%
right thank you madam chair and thank
 
05:24:49.510 --> 05:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
you for testifying um I'm not familiar
 
05:24:53.270 --> 05:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
with um meat processing very much but um
 
05:24:54.750 --> 05:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
this seems like an encouraging idea to
 
05:24:56.270 --> 05:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
get things into the right scale for New
 
05:24:59.868 --> 05:24:59.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but my question is uh the term
 
05:25:01.948 --> 05:25:01.958 align:start position:0%
custom Slaughter facility I don't know
 
05:25:04.510 --> 05:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
if that's Define the statutes or safety
 
05:25:06.030 --> 05:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
are there any health and safety
 
05:25:08.670 --> 05:25:08.680 align:start position:0%
standards how does that um could you Ed
 
05:25:11.750 --> 05:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
educate me good question and you know I
 
05:25:13.150 --> 05:25:13.160 align:start position:0%
can't answer that question I would
 
05:25:15.350 --> 05:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
actually have to look in to see if that
 
05:25:17.390 --> 05:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
is defined in representative Bixby has
 
05:25:19.030 --> 05:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
his hand raised so he may know the
 
05:25:21.030 --> 05:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
answer yes custom Slaughter is defined
 
05:25:23.510 --> 05:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
in statute um and it would be in the
 
05:25:25.510 --> 05:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
same chapter that this would be
 
05:25:29.868 --> 05:25:29.878 align:start position:0%
amending thank you okay represent
 
05:25:32.190 --> 05:25:32.200 align:start position:0%
Penza um thank you madam chair thank you
 
05:25:33.868 --> 05:25:33.878 align:start position:0%
for my question um just to kind of
 
05:25:35.390 --> 05:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
follow up with what representative
 
05:25:37.230 --> 05:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
Scully asked that's what I was talking
 
05:25:40.350 --> 05:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
about with like you know purchasing a c
 
05:25:42.708 --> 05:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
half a cow half a pig that those types
 
05:25:45.868 --> 05:25:45.878 align:start position:0%
of things people are right now having to
 
05:25:47.830 --> 05:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
scramble together because a lot of
 
05:25:50.030 --> 05:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
people don't want necessarily full or
 
05:25:52.510 --> 05:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
half or something like that um which it
 
05:25:54.270 --> 05:25:54.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense but they can't you
 
05:25:56.750 --> 05:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
can't buy a cut meaning you can't go buy
 
05:25:59.708 --> 05:25:59.718 align:start position:0%
a steak or all of that so my question to
 
05:26:02.910 --> 05:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
you is at the farmers markets which
 
05:26:06.350 --> 05:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
conquered has them um very popular there
 
05:26:08.750 --> 05:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
are usually two to three different
 
05:26:11.470 --> 05:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
trucks that are there that are selling
 
05:26:13.150 --> 05:26:13.160 align:start position:0%
pork and different types of things and
 
05:26:17.030 --> 05:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
they are selling Cuts so for those folks
 
05:26:19.070 --> 05:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
are they having to go through that
 
05:26:22.110 --> 05:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
entire process that you're talking about
 
05:26:24.270 --> 05:26:24.280 align:start position:0%
so well thank you for the question so if
 
05:26:26.070 --> 05:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
they're selling Cuts they would have to
 
05:26:29.868 --> 05:26:29.878 align:start position:0%
be going to a USDA facility yes and the
 
05:26:31.990 --> 05:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
thing to other to think about right is
 
05:26:34.190 --> 05:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
we're only talking about intrastate
 
05:26:38.310 --> 05:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
sales instate sales only this is not
 
05:26:41.390 --> 05:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
going across state lines this is only in
 
05:26:45.350 --> 05:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
state for New Hampshire anyone is in New
 
05:26:48.230 --> 05:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay representative H Haskins
 
05:26:49.670 --> 05:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:26:52.548 --> 05:26:52.558 align:start position:0%
taking my question so what is the
 
05:26:56.070 --> 05:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
definition of a custom Meat Shop what
 
05:26:59.868 --> 05:26:59.878 align:start position:0%
what am I to assume about a custom Meat
 
05:27:02.708 --> 05:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
Shop uh representative Bixby is there a
 
05:27:05.390 --> 05:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
05:27:07.510 --> 05:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
that there is but I don't have it
 
05:27:09.990 --> 05:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
memorized it's it's in the so thank you
 
05:27:12.788 --> 05:27:12.798 align:start position:0%
for the question follow up if I may sure
 
05:27:15.190 --> 05:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
you may would they be inspected or not
 
05:27:17.310 --> 05:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
inspected so so that's one of the things
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
that we could discuss I mean you know
 
05:27:22.948 --> 05:27:22.958 align:start position:0%
some facilities have a USDA inspection
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
but they're not a USDA facility so they
 
05:27:26.390 --> 05:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
are USDA
 
05:27:30.350 --> 05:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
inspected okay um so there's that I
 
05:27:32.948 --> 05:27:32.958 align:start position:0%
don't know you know there's some other
 
05:27:36.150 --> 05:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
caveats but I would urge this committee
 
05:27:38.670 --> 05:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
to listen to the people
 
05:27:41.110 --> 05:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
that are in favor of this and to read
 
05:27:43.230 --> 05:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
some of the text of the people that are
 
05:27:45.150 --> 05:27:45.160 align:start position:0%
in support of this there are a couple of
 
05:27:47.510 --> 05:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
people that own processing facilities
 
05:27:49.750 --> 05:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
that have contacted me but neither one
 
05:27:52.310 --> 05:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
of them could be here one is in uh
 
05:27:54.990 --> 05:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
Virginia and one of them I just couldn't
 
05:27:58.548 --> 05:27:58.558 align:start position:0%
get away to get here so I would urge you
 
05:28:01.990 --> 05:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
to go online and read those
 
05:28:04.670 --> 05:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
testimonies and if you have questions I
 
05:28:06.628 --> 05:28:06.638 align:start position:0%
am sure that they would be willing to
 
05:28:08.788 --> 05:28:08.798 align:start position:0%
help with any
 
05:28:11.788 --> 05:28:11.798 align:start position:0%
uh answer any questions thank
 
05:28:14.310 --> 05:28:14.320 align:start position:0%

05:28:16.430 --> 05:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair I was just
 
05:28:18.230 --> 05:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
looking up some definitions online would
 
05:28:23.070 --> 05:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
you consider the USDA meat processors a
 
05:28:26.548 --> 05:28:26.558 align:start position:0%
cartel thank you for the question um I
 
05:28:29.150 --> 05:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
don't know if I would consider them or I
 
05:28:32.390 --> 05:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
don't think I can answer that
 
05:28:35.150 --> 05:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
honestly okay any other questions from
 
05:28:38.190 --> 05:28:38.200 align:start position:0%

you have no okay okay thank you for your
 
05:28:44.230 --> 05:28:44.240 align:start position:0%

05:28:48.270 --> 05:28:48.280 align:start position:0%
bill um because I have a a number Fair
 
05:28:51.030 --> 05:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
number of pink slips I'm going to uh
 
05:28:54.310 --> 05:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
limit a testimony from everyone to three
 
05:28:58.470 --> 05:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
minutes if you would not mind um and we
 
05:29:00.830 --> 05:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
will have an opportunity to ask
 
05:29:03.430 --> 05:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
questions after but I will be timing
 
05:29:05.548 --> 05:29:05.558 align:start position:0%
everybody so I will let you know when
 
05:29:08.708 --> 05:29:08.718 align:start position:0%
your 3 minutes are up um I call uh
 
05:29:10.270 --> 05:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner Shan Jasper from the
 
05:29:11.910 --> 05:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture to come and
 
05:29:18.270 --> 05:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:20.868 --> 05:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner good afternoon Madam
 
05:29:22.150 --> 05:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee it's
 
05:29:23.670 --> 05:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
going to be hard for me to uh respond
 
05:29:24.670 --> 05:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
everything in three minutes I'm going to
 
05:29:27.628 --> 05:29:27.638 align:start position:0%
go as fast as I can so first of all
 
05:29:29.190 --> 05:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
there was a there was a comment made
 
05:29:31.750 --> 05:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
about um corporate farms and I just
 
05:29:34.830 --> 05:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to correct that 96 to 98% of the
 
05:29:37.590 --> 05:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
farms in America owned by families 85 to
 
05:29:41.150 --> 05:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
88 8% of the food produced in America is
 
05:29:45.548 --> 05:29:45.558 align:start position:0%
produced on Family Farms so what is the
 
05:29:47.150 --> 05:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
problem with the bill and can it be
 
05:29:50.948 --> 05:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
fixed no it cannot there is nothing that
 
05:29:54.430 --> 05:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
you can do to pass this bill and not be
 
05:29:58.830 --> 05:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
in violation of federal law 1907 federal
 
05:30:03.190 --> 05:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
government passed the uh the
 
05:30:06.670 --> 05:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
original uh Bill the federal Meat
 
05:30:09.670 --> 05:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
Inspection Act actually yeah was of 1906
 
05:30:12.030 --> 05:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
but pass in 1907 in
 
05:30:17.190 --> 05:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
1967 they amended that to include any
 
05:30:21.548 --> 05:30:21.558 align:start position:0%
inate Commerce as well prior to 1967 you
 
05:30:24.310 --> 05:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
could do exactly what is being proposed
 
05:30:27.470 --> 05:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
here since 1967 you cannot legally do
 
05:30:30.590 --> 05:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
that if you violate that law none of you
 
05:30:34.350 --> 05:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
are going to pay uh face a penalty but
 
05:30:36.470 --> 05:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
anyone who
 
05:30:38.788 --> 05:30:38.798 align:start position:0%
participates in that
 
05:30:40.628 --> 05:30:40.638 align:start position:0%
Commerce could
 
05:30:43.270 --> 05:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
face uh being charged with a misdemeanor
 
05:30:46.708 --> 05:30:46.718 align:start position:0%
and a $1,000 per event fine do you
 
05:30:48.310 --> 05:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
really want to do
 
05:30:51.470 --> 05:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
that um I would hope not because people
 
05:30:53.070 --> 05:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
would think oh well the legislature has
 
05:30:55.230 --> 05:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
done this and now we can go ahead and
 
05:30:57.190 --> 05:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
move forward with it you
 
05:31:01.350 --> 05:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
cannot um and I want to address a few
 
05:31:06.150 --> 05:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
other things in there so the wait time
 
05:31:08.030 --> 05:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
right now and by the way as far as I I
 
05:31:09.990 --> 05:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
know the slaughter houses in New
 
05:31:12.948 --> 05:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are USDA inspected are
 
05:31:16.548 --> 05:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
familyowned slaughter houses so you know
 
05:31:19.430 --> 05:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
there may be one that isn't but as far
 
05:31:22.030 --> 05:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
as I know the rest all are familyowned
 
05:31:24.110 --> 05:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
there are wait times because there are
 
05:31:25.990 --> 05:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
people who want to bring an animal in
 
05:31:29.990 --> 05:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
once in a while everyone I know who has
 
05:31:33.190 --> 05:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
a regular schedule has no problems and
 
05:31:34.430 --> 05:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
this is one of the things I've talked to
 
05:31:36.948 --> 05:31:36.958 align:start position:0%
the beef producers about is you need to
 
05:31:40.270 --> 05:31:40.280 align:start position:0%
be feeding animals into the facilities
 
05:31:43.230 --> 05:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
on a regular interval because what are
 
05:31:45.030 --> 05:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
they supposed to do have their staff
 
05:31:46.510 --> 05:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
sitting around waiting for something to
 
05:31:48.350 --> 05:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
come in you have to be at capacity all
 
05:31:50.830 --> 05:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
the time and so that's why there's a
 
05:31:54.230 --> 05:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
problem um but in terms of the custom
 
05:31:56.510 --> 05:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
custom is when you are doing it uh
 
05:31:58.230 --> 05:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
you're bringing the animal to to
 
05:32:00.510 --> 05:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
somebody to have
 
05:32:04.590 --> 05:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
them do the uh Slaughter and and cutting
 
05:32:07.270 --> 05:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
of that meat for your own use your
 
05:32:11.350 --> 05:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
gasture family um but not for sale what
 
05:32:13.030 --> 05:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
else does this bill do that nobody
 
05:32:15.510 --> 05:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
talked about it also takes out the
 
05:32:19.150 --> 05:32:19.160 align:start position:0%
requirements on the poultry end of it um
 
05:32:22.310 --> 05:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
and that's a concern as well you can't
 
05:32:24.590 --> 05:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
do it as I said but the effect of this
 
05:32:27.910 --> 05:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
is right now you can do a thousand Birds
 
05:32:29.708 --> 05:32:29.718 align:start position:0%
uh if you've raised them on your farm
 
05:32:33.628 --> 05:32:33.638 align:start position:0%
20,000 on other conditions but um that's
 
05:32:37.030 --> 05:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
coming away in the federal inspection if
 
05:32:39.788 --> 05:32:39.798 align:start position:0%
I may there are also sanitary conditions
 
05:32:41.708 --> 05:32:41.718 align:start position:0%
which you are removing because if you
 
05:32:44.590 --> 05:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
look at the actual uh verbiage you're
 
05:32:46.350 --> 05:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
taking out you're taking out all of that
 
05:32:48.548 --> 05:32:48.558 align:start position:0%
as well glad to answer any questions
 
05:32:51.510 --> 05:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay questions from the
 
05:32:54.230 --> 05:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
committee representa Bixby and then
 
05:32:57.390 --> 05:32:57.400 align:start position:0%
representative King so um I hadn't
 
05:32:58.948 --> 05:32:58.958 align:start position:0%
thought about this question until this
 
05:33:00.788 --> 05:33:00.798 align:start position:0%
morning when I was discussing this bill
 
05:33:04.788 --> 05:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
with my wife and she said what happens
 
05:33:08.350 --> 05:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
when the uh current federal government
 
05:33:10.390 --> 05:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh gets rid of the
 
05:33:14.390 --> 05:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
inspectors any thoughts about that well
 
05:33:16.430 --> 05:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that that is going to
 
05:33:17.910 --> 05:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
happen that's
 
05:33:20.868 --> 05:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
theoretical uh of course but they would
 
05:33:22.590 --> 05:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
have to address how that those
 
05:33:25.350 --> 05:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
inspections would take place I mean who
 
05:33:27.590 --> 05:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
knows I mean what happens if the
 
05:33:30.150 --> 05:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
asteroid hits us I you know thank you
 
05:33:32.708 --> 05:33:32.718 align:start position:0%
hey representative King thank you madam
 
05:33:34.390 --> 05:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
chair uh you thank you for taking
 
05:33:37.190 --> 05:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
questions you referenced federal law yes
 
05:33:40.750 --> 05:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
um and this bill deals with intrastate
 
05:33:43.190 --> 05:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
Commerce does the federal law also deal
 
05:33:45.310 --> 05:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
with the intrastate Commerce as I said
 
05:33:45.320 --> 05:33:46.548 align:start position:0%
with the intrastate Commerce as I said
in

05:33:46.548 --> 05:33:46.558 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:33:50.310 --> 05:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
1967 the uh Act was amended and so that
 
05:33:55.230 --> 05:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
all inate okay um sales came under the
 
05:33:57.910 --> 05:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh act okay I have a second question
 
05:34:02.030 --> 05:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
second question um you mentioned
 
05:34:04.750 --> 05:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
that if people were to do this they'd be
 
05:34:06.948 --> 05:34:06.958 align:start position:0%
in violation of federal law um and I'm
 
05:34:09.030 --> 05:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
just thinking of like for example you
 
05:34:12.030 --> 05:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
know medical marijuana or other federal
 
05:34:14.510 --> 05:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
laws that were really like nullified at
 
05:34:16.788 --> 05:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
the state level and there were a lot of
 
05:34:18.510 --> 05:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
people all around the country that were
 
05:34:21.110 --> 05:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
willing to violate federal law and the
 
05:34:23.150 --> 05:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
states kind of had a hands-off uh
 
05:34:25.430 --> 05:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
approach and and we saw over time that
 
05:34:27.270 --> 05:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
the feds took a hands-off approach too
 
05:34:29.628 --> 05:34:29.638 align:start position:0%
in a lot of ways uh could you see that
 
05:34:32.270 --> 05:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
happening with things like this where
 
05:34:34.270 --> 05:34:34.280 align:start position:0%
maybe the feds would would be like eh
 
05:34:36.670 --> 05:34:36.680 align:start position:0%
let's not bother them because you know
 
05:34:39.110 --> 05:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's a States thing I I can't see that
 
05:34:42.190 --> 05:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
when it comes to food safety what you
 
05:34:44.590 --> 05:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
are doing you know in terms of medical
 
05:34:47.868 --> 05:34:47.878 align:start position:0%
marijuana or just recreational different
 
05:34:49.670 --> 05:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that there was a sheep
 
05:34:53.350 --> 05:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
farm in Lee which they were saying oh
 
05:34:56.670 --> 05:34:56.680 align:start position:0%
everybody owns this sheep and so they
 
05:34:59.350 --> 05:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
had a thousand sheep say on the farm but
 
05:35:03.030 --> 05:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
they were supposedly all uh individually
 
05:35:06.110 --> 05:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
owned and then they were slaughtering
 
05:35:09.430 --> 05:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
them there and essentially selling or it
 
05:35:11.070 --> 05:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
was actually the point I think where
 
05:35:12.430 --> 05:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
well you own half of this sheep and
 
05:35:14.510 --> 05:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
somebody else owns the other half the
 
05:35:16.310 --> 05:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
federal government came in and and shut
 
05:35:18.830 --> 05:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
them down so that is a real case of
 
05:35:20.310 --> 05:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
where that did
 
05:35:23.190 --> 05:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
happen Okay represent
 
05:35:26.548 --> 05:35:26.558 align:start position:0%
Penza um thank you madam chair um thank
 
05:35:28.110 --> 05:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question can you
 
05:35:31.868 --> 05:35:31.878 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that when was that that was
 
05:35:34.390 --> 05:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
probably and I go by that place all the
 
05:35:37.628 --> 05:35:37.638 align:start position:0%
time probably within the last 15 years
 
05:35:40.310 --> 05:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
15 probably within the last
 
05:35:44.948 --> 05:35:44.958 align:start position:0%
15 follow up follow up um I like
 
05:35:47.470 --> 05:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
representative King's line of thinking
 
05:35:51.990 --> 05:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
and do you see especially with um all of
 
05:35:54.628 --> 05:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
the problems that have been happening uh
 
05:35:58.270 --> 05:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
all across the country with um in
 
05:36:00.868 --> 05:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
representative cona went through them
 
05:36:04.510 --> 05:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
all um recalls and all of these things
 
05:36:08.070 --> 05:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
um do you see that that is um changing
 
05:36:10.590 --> 05:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
some especially with new new
 
05:36:12.670 --> 05:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
Administration um and there is
 
05:36:14.788 --> 05:36:14.798 align:start position:0%
definitely uh it looks as if there's
 
05:36:18.750 --> 05:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
going to be a shift in in that for more
 
05:36:21.670 --> 05:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
localized processing especially if they
 
05:36:24.390 --> 05:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
are falling underneath what we call the
 
05:36:27.390 --> 05:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
their their USDA certified and they've
 
05:36:31.070 --> 05:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
been approved I I couldn't possibly
 
05:36:32.910 --> 05:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
speculate on that and I'm not here to
 
05:36:35.548 --> 05:36:35.558 align:start position:0%
defend the current system I'm here to
 
05:36:37.628 --> 05:36:37.638 align:start position:0%
tell you that I don't believe you should
 
05:36:40.310 --> 05:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
be putting people at risk under the
 
05:36:43.628 --> 05:36:43.638 align:start position:0%
color of state law and in fact having
 
05:36:47.470 --> 05:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
them risk being F and charged with a
 
05:36:49.708 --> 05:36:49.718 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor what I'm what I'm going to
 
05:36:51.150 --> 05:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
suggest is that you should be working
 
05:36:55.190 --> 05:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
with a federal delegation to broaden
 
05:36:58.590 --> 05:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
this this act such as it is for poultry
 
05:37:00.510 --> 05:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
where you have on Farm you can do a
 
05:37:02.350 --> 05:37:02.360 align:start position:0%
thousand but you've got to have courses
 
05:37:05.990 --> 05:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
through UNH you have to find follow the
 
05:37:08.708 --> 05:37:08.718 align:start position:0%
um sanitary code that the secretary of
 
05:37:11.150 --> 05:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
agriculture has imposed and we pretty
 
05:37:14.628 --> 05:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
much mimic that and uh and do that under
 
05:37:16.590 --> 05:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
this bill there's no sanitary code
 
05:37:18.750 --> 05:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
05:37:23.270 --> 05:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
um uh no inspections of that and that
 
05:37:25.948 --> 05:37:25.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't fix the bill because
 
05:37:28.510 --> 05:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
underlying problem is it can't legally
 
05:37:30.310 --> 05:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
be done and we have to fix this at the
 
05:37:33.548 --> 05:37:33.558 align:start position:0%
federal L level do not put people at
 
05:37:36.590 --> 05:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
risk maybe feel good but you're not the
 
05:37:39.150 --> 05:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
ones who are going to face the
 
05:37:42.390 --> 05:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
consequences of your
 
05:37:45.510 --> 05:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
actions representative germana thank you
 
05:37:47.708 --> 05:37:47.718 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you commissioner So
 
05:37:49.628 --> 05:37:49.638 align:start position:0%
based on you know your years of
 
05:37:52.030 --> 05:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
experience uh is it is it safe to say
 
05:37:54.430 --> 05:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
that it would be unwise for us to make
 
05:37:56.628 --> 05:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
decisions based on what we think an
 
05:37:58.910 --> 05:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
Administration a current Administration
 
05:38:00.948 --> 05:38:00.958 align:start position:0%
may or may not do I think that would be
 
05:38:04.030 --> 05:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
very unwise you are legislators you are
 
05:38:07.150 --> 05:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
sworn to uphold the laws you're so and
 
05:38:09.910 --> 05:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
that includes the constitution of of the
 
05:38:12.350 --> 05:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
United States and the state of New
 
05:38:14.590 --> 05:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think that you should be
 
05:38:17.070 --> 05:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
doing that this is an emotional issue
 
05:38:19.590 --> 05:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
and I ask you to take the emotion out of
 
05:38:22.990 --> 05:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
your decision here and base this on the
 
05:38:26.390 --> 05:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
laws that we are all sworn to uphold
 
05:38:27.708 --> 05:38:27.718 align:start position:0%
that's why I didn't provide a fiscal
 
05:38:31.868 --> 05:38:31.878 align:start position:0%
note because I I've told the uh LBA I
 
05:38:34.708 --> 05:38:34.718 align:start position:0%
would not participate in anything that
 
05:38:37.430 --> 05:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
was a violation of Law and me Prov
 
05:38:39.868 --> 05:38:39.878 align:start position:0%
providing a fiscal note in my CA in my
 
05:38:42.910 --> 05:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
opinion was a violation of of my oath
 
05:38:45.430 --> 05:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
and I would not do it thank
 
05:38:48.628 --> 05:38:48.638 align:start position:0%
you question uh representative
 
05:38:50.750 --> 05:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair would you
 
05:38:52.590 --> 05:38:52.600 align:start position:0%
believe there are a lot of federal laws
 
05:38:54.510 --> 05:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
that are not also reciprocated at the
 
05:38:56.468 --> 05:38:56.478 align:start position:0%
state level and just because we don't
 
05:38:58.590 --> 05:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
have a state law in the books does not
 
05:39:02.030 --> 05:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
mean we're violating federal law in some
 
05:39:04.750 --> 05:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
cases that is true but this is very
 
05:39:09.110 --> 05:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
specific and it is um you code 21
 
05:39:12.350 --> 05:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
section 623 and if you have not read
 
05:39:14.670 --> 05:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
read that please do you're also
 
05:39:19.830 --> 05:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
repealing um us code uh 21 section
 
05:39:22.708 --> 05:39:22.718 align:start position:0%
464c which has to do with uh with
 
05:39:25.670 --> 05:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
poultry products in the requirements
 
05:39:29.350 --> 05:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
there so please read those codes very
 
05:39:31.750 --> 05:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
carefully and understand them as I have
 
05:39:34.548 --> 05:39:34.558 align:start position:0%
I've studied the these codes for several
 
05:39:36.708 --> 05:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
years now trying to g grip on what we
 
05:39:39.788 --> 05:39:39.798 align:start position:0%
can and can't do I've also spoken with
 
05:39:42.990 --> 05:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
person in charge of USDA for our region
 
05:39:45.150 --> 05:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm familiar with what it takes for
 
05:39:48.110 --> 05:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
someone to become uh licensed the
 
05:39:50.310 --> 05:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
problem in my opinion from studying this
 
05:39:53.590 --> 05:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
for years is the supply of animals if we
 
05:39:56.628 --> 05:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
had enough animals going in on a daily
 
05:40:00.590 --> 05:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:03.548 --> 05:40:03.558 align:start position:0%
houses can you cite those uh us codes
 
05:40:07.788 --> 05:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
again you said us code 21 you yep uh us
 
05:40:11.070 --> 05:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
code 21 section
 
05:40:15.948 --> 05:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
623a or section uh 21 excuse me US code
 
05:40:20.708 --> 05:40:20.718 align:start position:0%
21 section 464 c um and that is actually
 
05:40:22.990 --> 05:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
the verbiage if you look at B that you
 
05:40:25.510 --> 05:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
were removing from the current law
 
05:40:28.548 --> 05:40:28.558 align:start position:0%
that's in the current
 
05:40:35.590 --> 05:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
law okay so I have a I I guess I am
 
05:40:40.390 --> 05:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
confused as to why it's okay for a
 
05:40:45.070 --> 05:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
person to own a cow or a pig or whatever
 
05:40:49.270 --> 05:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
or buy a half a cow or a half a pig and
 
05:40:53.628 --> 05:40:53.638 align:start position:0%
have that slaughtered as opposed
 
05:40:56.990 --> 05:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
to the custom Meat Shop having a having
 
05:40:59.830 --> 05:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
a cow and cutting it up and selling it
 
05:41:02.270 --> 05:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
individually because there is a this is
 
05:41:05.590 --> 05:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
the the Live Free or Die State and you
 
05:41:07.310 --> 05:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
know in the country this is allowed
 
05:41:10.070 --> 05:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere because it is your animal and
 
05:41:12.670 --> 05:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
you are personally understanding that
 
05:41:15.468 --> 05:41:15.478 align:start position:0%
risk when you enter into Commerce the
 
05:41:18.868 --> 05:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
person buying this does not have that
 
05:41:21.110 --> 05:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
that same knowledge they are assuming
 
05:41:23.510 --> 05:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
rightly or wrongly that the government
 
05:41:26.430 --> 05:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
is going to at least try to protect them
 
05:41:28.270 --> 05:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
and I would suggest as many recalls as
 
05:41:29.708 --> 05:41:29.718 align:start position:0%
there are and I see them every day
 
05:41:31.990 --> 05:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
because that's one of the bulletins I
 
05:41:35.788 --> 05:41:35.798 align:start position:0%
get that we have far more Safe products
 
05:41:39.190 --> 05:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
than we do uh unsafe products and so I
 
05:41:41.990 --> 05:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
think that is uh that's an important
 
05:41:45.628 --> 05:41:45.638 align:start position:0%
distinction um and we just you know we
 
05:41:47.670 --> 05:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
can't assume that everybody that's going
 
05:41:51.070 --> 05:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
to be slaughtering under uh under custom
 
05:41:52.750 --> 05:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
and then selling it is going to be doing
 
05:41:56.110 --> 05:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
it correctly again somebody doing this
 
05:41:59.590 --> 05:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
as a custom is just as likely to be
 
05:42:02.350 --> 05:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous or have unsanitary
 
05:42:05.310 --> 05:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
conditions than somebody who is
 
05:42:07.868 --> 05:42:07.878 align:start position:0%
inspected um but at least there somebody
 
05:42:11.150 --> 05:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
there inspecting you are not having any
 
05:42:13.750 --> 05:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
any traceability here in what we did
 
05:42:16.310 --> 05:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
last uh session legislature did last
 
05:42:18.510 --> 05:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
session I believe it was relative to the
 
05:42:21.868 --> 05:42:21.878 align:start position:0%
non-amenable species including bison and
 
05:42:24.868 --> 05:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
um essentially uh deer there is
 
05:42:27.310 --> 05:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
traceability in all of that there is
 
05:42:29.110 --> 05:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
packaging and that is not controlled the
 
05:42:31.150 --> 05:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
feds decided not to do that because
 
05:42:34.270 --> 05:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
certainly that wasn't as big a deal it's
 
05:42:36.548 --> 05:42:36.558 align:start position:0%
becoming bigger and don't ever ask me to
 
05:42:37.910 --> 05:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
try to explain why the federal
 
05:42:41.150 --> 05:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
government does anything CU I will never
 
05:42:41.160 --> 05:42:42.150 align:start position:0%
government does anything CU I will never
understand

05:42:42.150 --> 05:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
understand
 
05:42:44.948 --> 05:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
that but I know what the law is and
 
05:42:48.190 --> 05:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
rather I like it or not our job is to
 
05:42:52.110 --> 05:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
uphold the laws and work to change them
 
05:42:53.990 --> 05:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh as I said at the federal level we
 
05:42:56.110 --> 05:42:56.120 align:start position:0%
should do that I think Farm Bureau
 
05:42:58.070 --> 05:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
bureau's policy is going to be to try to
 
05:43:00.830 --> 05:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
do that as well and I agree with that
 
05:43:04.548 --> 05:43:04.558 align:start position:0%
and I think that we can do more but not
 
05:43:08.390 --> 05:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
at the moment any questions
 
05:43:10.788 --> 05:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner thank you I'm
 
05:43:17.030 --> 05:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
inis and again I'll give you three
 
05:43:21.110 --> 05:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
minutes and then we can ask questions
 
05:43:22.670 --> 05:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
05:43:24.948 --> 05:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
the committee um I'm here briefly it'll
 
05:43:27.868 --> 05:43:27.878 align:start position:0%
be less than three minutes I suspect um
 
05:43:29.910 --> 05:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
and um Howard Pearl has signed in in
 
05:43:32.230 --> 05:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
support Senator Pearl and um we've
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
talked about this this bill and I
 
05:43:36.230 --> 05:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate the commissioner's comments I
 
05:43:37.510 --> 05:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
understand where he's coming from and it
 
05:43:38.670 --> 05:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
makes sense but I'm going to take a
 
05:43:41.750 --> 05:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
different tack on this um I'm a
 
05:43:44.390 --> 05:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
marketing professor at UNH um three
 
05:43:46.110 --> 05:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
degrees in marketing and to me this is a
 
05:43:48.070 --> 05:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
market access issue that's really what
 
05:43:50.310 --> 05:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
this comes down to we have customers who
 
05:43:52.868 --> 05:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
want great products from local farms
 
05:43:55.310 --> 05:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
that they trust and understand and we
 
05:43:56.708 --> 05:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
have farmers who need to get their
 
05:43:58.548 --> 05:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
product to Market in an efficient and
 
05:44:00.830 --> 05:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
effective way and get it to those very
 
05:44:02.430 --> 05:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
customers that want it whether it's a
 
05:44:05.030 --> 05:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant or an individual or a grocery
 
05:44:08.070 --> 05:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
store and yet our government repeatedly
 
05:44:10.350 --> 05:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
gets in the way of small farmers for the
 
05:44:12.350 --> 05:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
record um and I should have mentioned
 
05:44:14.990 --> 05:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
this Dan inis Bradford district 7 um I
 
05:44:17.150 --> 05:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
have a small farm it's 150 acres
 
05:44:19.788 --> 05:44:19.798 align:start position:0%
presently we have 25 head of wagu cattle
 
05:44:21.708 --> 05:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
we're going to 50 we will be one of
 
05:44:23.310 --> 05:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
those processors that the commissioner
 
05:44:25.390 --> 05:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned who just sends the occasional
 
05:44:27.548 --> 05:44:27.558 align:start position:0%
animal maybe one a month but that's not
 
05:44:28.670 --> 05:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
going to be enough to get us the
 
05:44:30.750 --> 05:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
preferential treatment we need to USDA
 
05:44:32.948 --> 05:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
facility so we're forced to sell the
 
05:44:35.390 --> 05:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
product in ways that are less effective
 
05:44:37.910 --> 05:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
for us and cost more for us to get to
 
05:44:40.110 --> 05:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
Market and that's not what consumers
 
05:44:42.430 --> 05:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
want that's not what the small farms
 
05:44:45.468 --> 05:44:45.478 align:start position:0%
want having a local processor in our
 
05:44:48.948 --> 05:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
case a town or two over is much easier
 
05:44:51.070 --> 05:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
to do it puts the animal under less
 
05:44:53.468 --> 05:44:53.478 align:start position:0%
stress less cortisol other things
 
05:44:55.110 --> 05:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
flowing through its system right before
 
05:44:57.230 --> 05:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
Slaughter makes a better product for
 
05:45:00.350 --> 05:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
everybody no producer be it a farmer or
 
05:45:03.030 --> 05:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
a custom slaughterhouse wants to poison
 
05:45:05.548 --> 05:45:05.558 align:start position:0%
or make a customer sick that's just not
 
05:45:07.390 --> 05:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
what we're in the business of doing and
 
05:45:09.390 --> 05:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
consumers are smart gee I bought that
 
05:45:11.430 --> 05:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
beef from Dan and I threw up I'm not
 
05:45:14.590 --> 05:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
going to him again right problem solved
 
05:45:16.390 --> 05:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
um now that's I don't think that's going
 
05:45:19.548 --> 05:45:19.558 align:start position:0%
to happen um you can get ill from food
 
05:45:21.670 --> 05:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
that comes from all sorts of sources
 
05:45:25.628 --> 05:45:25.638 align:start position:0%
even USDA inspected Chipotle famous for
 
05:45:27.830 --> 05:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
the problems that they had you can get
 
05:45:31.590 --> 05:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
eoli from be from Sprouts um there's
 
05:45:34.270 --> 05:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
nothing that's without risk but I really
 
05:45:36.230 --> 05:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
like this bill because I think it puts
 
05:45:38.708 --> 05:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
everything right here right here with
 
05:45:40.788 --> 05:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
the people we know and the people that
 
05:45:42.510 --> 05:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
we work with and these custom slaughter
 
05:45:44.708 --> 05:45:44.718 align:start position:0%
houses are small high probability the
 
05:45:46.110 --> 05:45:46.120 align:start position:0%
owner is the one working with your
 
05:45:47.910 --> 05:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
animal and they want your business they
 
05:45:49.190 --> 05:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
want to keep your business they want to
 
05:45:51.548 --> 05:45:51.558 align:start position:0%
help you to grow so they can grow so
 
05:45:53.590 --> 05:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
this is a market access issue I hope we
 
05:45:55.190 --> 05:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
can find a way to do it again I
 
05:45:57.070 --> 05:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate the commissioner's comments I
 
05:45:58.708 --> 05:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
understand what he's saying I'm sure
 
05:46:01.948 --> 05:46:01.958 align:start position:0%
he's not wrong uh and yet the marijuana
 
05:46:05.190 --> 05:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
comment I found intriguing um because it
 
05:46:07.230 --> 05:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
may well be that the feds say you know
 
05:46:08.708 --> 05:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
what we're just not going to look over
 
05:46:11.670 --> 05:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
there I I can't say that that's the case
 
05:46:13.788 --> 05:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
um but anything we can do to make it
 
05:46:16.070 --> 05:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
easier for the few remaining small farms
 
05:46:19.030 --> 05:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
in this state I think we should do and
 
05:46:21.190 --> 05:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
you know I it's it's in my family it
 
05:46:23.468 --> 05:46:23.478 align:start position:0%
skipped my father that was it I had a
 
05:46:25.468 --> 05:46:25.478 align:start position:0%
moment of insanity and decided to do
 
05:46:29.030 --> 05:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
this um I've learned a lot and it's not
 
05:46:31.310 --> 05:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
easy to get to Market thank you okay
 
05:46:34.230 --> 05:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
represent Penza thank you madam chair
 
05:46:36.030 --> 05:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking my question
 
05:46:39.270 --> 05:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
of course do you um do you think that
 
05:46:41.468 --> 05:46:41.478 align:start position:0%
there is you know just kind of
 
05:46:43.830 --> 05:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
piggybacking off of the commissioner's
 
05:46:45.948 --> 05:46:45.958 align:start position:0%
testimony do you believe that there is a
 
05:46:49.830 --> 05:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
way that we could craft this legislation
 
05:46:52.070 --> 05:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative ktoa was was pretty
 
05:46:53.390 --> 05:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
clear about this bill is going to need
 
05:46:57.468 --> 05:46:57.478 align:start position:0%
to be amended y that we could still stay
 
05:47:00.510 --> 05:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
within compliance of federal law and
 
05:47:02.590 --> 05:47:02.600 align:start position:0%
make this happen it's an interesting
 
05:47:03.990 --> 05:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
question you ask and and the
 
05:47:05.468 --> 05:47:05.478 align:start position:0%
commissioner and I spoke a year or two
 
05:47:07.350 --> 05:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
ago about
 
05:47:09.628 --> 05:47:09.638 align:start position:0%
A system that the USDA does have in
 
05:47:11.548 --> 05:47:11.558 align:start position:0%
place and it might be you know we could
 
05:47:13.628 --> 05:47:13.638 align:start position:0%
work with them to find a way to make it
 
05:47:16.310 --> 05:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
more accessible to the small farmers so
 
05:47:18.548 --> 05:47:18.558 align:start position:0%
apparently and commissioner I don't know
 
05:47:21.150 --> 05:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
if he's still here he's not um but the
 
05:47:24.190 --> 05:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
USDA I had a similar Bill the USDA sent
 
05:47:26.628 --> 05:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
us a letter sent it to him and said you
 
05:47:28.708 --> 05:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
don't need this we have roving
 
05:47:31.270 --> 05:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
inspectors that you can get to go to a
 
05:47:32.750 --> 05:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
custom Meat House and be there as an
 
05:47:35.510 --> 05:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
inspector that day it's not easy um I
 
05:47:37.270 --> 05:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
don't think but that me may be a
 
05:47:39.030 --> 05:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
direction we could go and maybe we could
 
05:47:41.270 --> 05:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
tweak this a little bit you know in that
 
05:47:43.430 --> 05:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
direction but I I don't know it's a it's
 
05:47:45.430 --> 05:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
a tough one but but I was impressed that
 
05:47:47.990 --> 05:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
that existed but but you've already
 
05:47:49.948 --> 05:47:49.958 align:start position:0%
heard how hard it is to get a USDA
 
05:47:51.910 --> 05:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
inspected facility to take your animals
 
05:47:53.070 --> 05:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to pull an inspector
 
05:47:54.430 --> 05:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
from one of those facilities to send it
 
05:47:56.390 --> 05:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
to another one I think scheduling is
 
05:47:58.390 --> 05:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
still going to be an issue represent
 
05:48:01.990 --> 05:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
pend a followup yeah quick followup um
 
05:48:04.190 --> 05:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
there's a there was a restaurant in
 
05:48:07.070 --> 05:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that um we used to go to
 
05:48:09.590 --> 05:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
my husband's from Massachusetts that
 
05:48:12.990 --> 05:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
sourced all of their meat local yes and
 
05:48:15.430 --> 05:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
and I know that the they didn't follow
 
05:48:18.150 --> 05:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
this process right so it was it was
 
05:48:21.270 --> 05:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
great cuz like you could purchase um
 
05:48:23.390 --> 05:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
like you were getting you know a prime
 
05:48:26.270 --> 05:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
specifically from you know John Smith
 
05:48:30.350 --> 05:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
farmer in you know um yeah uh fitur bass
 
05:48:32.150 --> 05:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
or whatever it may be and it it was
 
05:48:33.990 --> 05:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
really cool and it had all of their
 
05:48:36.990 --> 05:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
stuff was sourced local and um I know
 
05:48:38.628 --> 05:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
there's some other restaurants that do
 
05:48:41.548 --> 05:48:41.558 align:start position:0%
that so is there a is there a carve out
 
05:48:44.230 --> 05:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
already that is for some of these
 
05:48:46.310 --> 05:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
restaurants that are doing Farm to Table
 
05:48:48.390 --> 05:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
because I know it's happening because I
 
05:48:50.830 --> 05:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
I I've seen it yeah I can't speak to
 
05:48:53.110 --> 05:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and how they do things so
 
05:48:55.270 --> 05:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
I I have to say I don't know um I find
 
05:48:57.110 --> 05:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
it intriguing though so
 
05:48:59.430 --> 05:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
maybe I I wonder if some of those
 
05:49:02.030 --> 05:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
restaurants are buying the animal and
 
05:49:03.990 --> 05:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
taking it to a custom shop could be yeah
 
05:49:05.468 --> 05:49:05.478 align:start position:0%
they're buying a half and then they're
 
05:49:07.430 --> 05:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
processing it but you know that the
 
05:49:10.230 --> 05:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
margins on a half are are a little bit
 
05:49:11.628 --> 05:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
lower than they are on selling the
 
05:49:13.230 --> 05:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
individual pieces so it's to the
 
05:49:15.150 --> 05:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
farmers's benefit to get this thing
 
05:49:17.708 --> 05:49:17.718 align:start position:0%
portioned off yeah representative King
 
05:49:19.510 --> 05:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you for
 
05:49:20.868 --> 05:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
taking questions you're just the person
 
05:49:22.468 --> 05:49:22.478 align:start position:0%
I want to ask this I was thinking about
 
05:49:24.110 --> 05:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
it I was thinking about it earlier but
 
05:49:26.510 --> 05:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
seeing as how you have a background in
 
05:49:29.030 --> 05:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh what Market uh options and things
 
05:49:32.390 --> 05:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
like that yeah um it seems to me that
 
05:49:33.590 --> 05:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
back in the old this is a little bit
 
05:49:36.190 --> 05:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
philosophical but back in the olden days
 
05:49:38.868 --> 05:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
brand name actually meant something
 
05:49:41.548 --> 05:49:41.558 align:start position:0%
because that was like oh uh this is a
 
05:49:45.110 --> 05:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
trusted brand and people you know knew
 
05:49:47.468 --> 05:49:47.478 align:start position:0%
what they were getting and maybe they
 
05:49:49.468 --> 05:49:49.478 align:start position:0%
paid a little bit of a premium for a
 
05:49:52.510 --> 05:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
trusted brand but then maybe a small UPS
 
05:49:56.548 --> 05:49:56.558 align:start position:0%
up startart um maybe had better value uh
 
05:49:59.030 --> 05:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
but maybe not the same you know trusted
 
05:50:00.750 --> 05:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
brand that you know Oscar Meyer or
 
05:50:03.070 --> 05:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
Johnsonville Farms or something had can
 
05:50:05.150 --> 05:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
you speak a little bit on that and and
 
05:50:06.708 --> 05:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
and whether or not if we started
 
05:50:09.270 --> 05:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
implementing these sorts of um uh
 
05:50:13.270 --> 05:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
decentralized food food service bills if
 
05:50:16.030 --> 05:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
that would um bring back the importance
 
05:50:18.910 --> 05:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
of brand name again I think brand name
 
05:50:21.868 --> 05:50:21.878 align:start position:0%
is fairly important um as a marketer of
 
05:50:23.788 --> 05:50:23.798 align:start position:0%
course um and we're trying to build a
 
05:50:25.830 --> 05:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
brand name um we're doing it very
 
05:50:27.788 --> 05:50:27.798 align:start position:0%
locally we're selling eggs yes we've
 
05:50:31.030 --> 05:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
raised our prices too um but uh the
 
05:50:33.468 --> 05:50:33.478 align:start position:0%
brand is important but you know in the
 
05:50:35.190 --> 05:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
national meat market you do have some
 
05:50:37.430 --> 05:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
big brands that people recognize but you
 
05:50:39.190 --> 05:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
know this bill is really about creating
 
05:50:41.030 --> 05:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
small Regional Brands within our own
 
05:50:43.230 --> 05:50:43.240 align:start position:0%
state so brands that the people of New
 
05:50:45.830 --> 05:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Granite Staters know and love
 
05:50:47.788 --> 05:50:47.798 align:start position:0%
and that's really what I think our small
 
05:50:49.788 --> 05:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
farmers would be able to start to build
 
05:50:51.150 --> 05:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
and we'd appear at some of those
 
05:50:53.468 --> 05:50:53.478 align:start position:0%
restaurants a little more often um I'd
 
05:50:54.910 --> 05:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
love to be at Joe faroh's place in
 
05:50:57.070 --> 05:50:57.080 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth with our product and if
 
05:50:58.590 --> 05:50:58.600 align:start position:0%
something like this can get through it
 
05:51:00.430 --> 05:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
will facilitate that
 
05:51:03.628 --> 05:51:03.638 align:start position:0%
process representative germana thank you
 
05:51:05.230 --> 05:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you senator for taking
 
05:51:07.150 --> 05:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
my question so and I appreciate the fact
 
05:51:08.590 --> 05:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor said that she was
 
05:51:10.150 --> 05:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
willing to work with us in terms of
 
05:51:12.628 --> 05:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
crafting an amendment particularly to
 
05:51:15.270 --> 05:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
consider scale and and where we draw a
 
05:51:18.708 --> 05:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
line between a smaller scale operation
 
05:51:20.190 --> 05:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
and so I'm just
 
05:51:22.788 --> 05:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
wondering with your experience in
 
05:51:24.510 --> 05:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
marketing right I mean because to me
 
05:51:26.190 --> 05:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
again I'm thinking about this bill if
 
05:51:27.628 --> 05:51:27.638 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about restaurants hotels
 
05:51:30.788 --> 05:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
boarding houses Etc these seem to me to
 
05:51:34.270 --> 05:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
be exactly the kinds of distribution
 
05:51:37.750 --> 05:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
points that we intend to have yes
 
05:51:41.670 --> 05:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
inspections for so where where in your
 
05:51:44.830 --> 05:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
mind based on your uh academic expertise
 
05:51:47.910 --> 05:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
and your expertise in husbandry uh does
 
05:51:51.990 --> 05:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
that line fall I don't know um and I
 
05:51:54.190 --> 05:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
could make something up but I won't um I
 
05:51:57.708 --> 05:51:57.718 align:start position:0%
think they what kind of Professor are
 
05:52:00.590 --> 05:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
you same kind of same professor as I am
 
05:52:03.070 --> 05:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
a legis makes up stuff all the time
 
05:52:04.910 --> 05:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
exactly it doesn't stop me there are
 
05:52:06.948 --> 05:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
some folks behind me I know with the
 
05:52:08.830 --> 05:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
Farm Bureau who might be able to shed a
 
05:52:10.628 --> 05:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
little light on that um but I'm probably
 
05:52:12.548 --> 05:52:12.558 align:start position:0%
not the guy I one more thing I point out
 
05:52:14.628 --> 05:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
you know we sell raw milk in the state
 
05:52:17.310 --> 05:52:17.320 align:start position:0%
right and that's what we buy and drink
 
05:52:19.230 --> 05:52:19.240 align:start position:0%
um we get it from you know various small
 
05:52:20.590 --> 05:52:20.600 align:start position:0%
farms around the state so we're already
 
05:52:22.468 --> 05:52:22.478 align:start position:0%
doing some of this and nobody's getting
 
05:52:24.948 --> 05:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
sick nobody's dying and the farmers and
 
05:52:26.628 --> 05:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
the processors are taking care to make
 
05:52:29.030 --> 05:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
sure everything is clean and good to go
 
05:52:31.030 --> 05:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
and that will happen here follow up
 
05:52:32.830 --> 05:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
follow up I'm sorry stepped in it with
 
05:52:35.468 --> 05:52:35.478 align:start position:0%
raw milk because last year we had a
 
05:52:36.990 --> 05:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
couple of bills I think our two years
 
05:52:40.030 --> 05:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
ago on raw milk and and I just want to
 
05:52:41.990 --> 05:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
point out that that we had a healthy
 
05:52:44.628 --> 05:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
debate but we also drew a very specific
 
05:52:48.270 --> 05:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
line in terms of scale uh and and we we
 
05:52:49.990 --> 05:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
aired on the side of smaller scale with
 
05:52:52.590 --> 05:52:52.600 align:start position:0%
raw milk yeah I appreciate that and and
 
05:52:54.868 --> 05:52:54.878 align:start position:0%
I think this is a similar situation okay
 
05:52:57.310 --> 05:52:57.320 align:start position:0%
representative Scully thank you madam
 
05:52:59.430 --> 05:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
05:53:01.548 --> 05:53:01.558 align:start position:0%
of course if I understood what you said
 
05:53:04.468 --> 05:53:04.478 align:start position:0%
you had basically taken a run at this um
 
05:53:06.510 --> 05:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
a while back actually had some
 
05:53:08.110 --> 05:53:08.120 align:start position:0%
interaction with the interaction with
 
05:53:09.788 --> 05:53:09.798 align:start position:0%
the federal government and they rendered
 
05:53:12.670 --> 05:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
an opinion is that uh opinion can that
 
05:53:14.750 --> 05:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
be made available to this uh committee
 
05:53:18.030 --> 05:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
so we could evaluate it maybe the chair
 
05:53:19.628 --> 05:53:19.638 align:start position:0%
could check with the commissioner I
 
05:53:21.190 --> 05:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
think he probably still has that letter
 
05:53:24.110 --> 05:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
I don't have my copy all right thank you
 
05:53:26.270 --> 05:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
yes any other
 
05:53:29.510 --> 05:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
questions quick question represent Penza
 
05:53:31.150 --> 05:53:31.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um just a quick
 
05:53:33.788 --> 05:53:33.798 align:start position:0%
followup maybe does it make sense to get
 
05:53:36.230 --> 05:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
another opinion an updated one at this
 
05:53:38.830 --> 05:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
point Point might new Administration new
 
05:53:41.230 --> 05:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
things happening true true we're awfully
 
05:53:43.110 --> 05:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
early in that new Administration so I
 
05:53:44.948 --> 05:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
don't know but but I think that's not a
 
05:53:48.190 --> 05:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
bad idea absolutely okay thank you okay
 
05:53:50.708 --> 05:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Andis call
 
05:53:56.350 --> 05:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:59.628 --> 05:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
Summers three minutes three minutes
 
05:54:01.030 --> 05:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you members
 
05:54:04.150 --> 05:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
of the committee um after speaking with
 
05:54:06.510 --> 05:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
um commissioner Jasper quite a bit on
 
05:54:08.390 --> 05:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
and doing some research on it myself he
 
05:54:09.990 --> 05:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
covered a lot of the areas that I was
 
05:54:12.110 --> 05:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
going to mention so I'll keep it brief
 
05:54:13.948 --> 05:54:13.958 align:start position:0%
and just go particularly to the what the
 
05:54:16.430 --> 05:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
bill is written state state law
 
05:54:19.030 --> 05:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
violations and federal law as what what
 
05:54:20.948 --> 05:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
he did not cover or what expand on what
 
05:54:24.070 --> 05:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
he didn't cover so um looking at the
 
05:54:26.270 --> 05:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
actual bill the actual bill which
 
05:54:30.948 --> 05:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
repeals 427 D um col 2-
 
05:54:33.830 --> 05:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
a1b um and that's what this would do and
 
05:54:36.030 --> 05:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
then change the wording of that actual
 
05:54:40.430 --> 05:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
AR RSA what it does not do however is it
 
05:54:42.590 --> 05:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
does not eliminate by doing that
 
05:54:44.390 --> 05:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
repealing that it still would leave in
 
05:54:46.150 --> 05:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
place RSA
 
05:54:46.160 --> 05:54:48.990 align:start position:0%
place RSA
4272

05:54:48.990 --> 05:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
4272
 
05:54:51.788 --> 05:54:51.798 align:start position:0%
A1C which actually states that provided
 
05:54:53.868 --> 05:54:53.878 align:start position:0%
such that custom Slaughter does not
 
05:54:55.830 --> 05:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
engage in the business of buying or
 
05:54:57.990 --> 05:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
selling any carcasses part of carcasses
 
05:55:00.350 --> 05:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
meat or meat food products and of any
 
05:55:03.510 --> 05:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
livestock capable of use as human food
 
05:55:05.350 --> 05:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
therefore you'd be negating exactly what
 
05:55:07.070 --> 05:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
you're repealing just by leaving that
 
05:55:09.590 --> 05:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
part in that's one thing now the second
 
05:55:12.270 --> 05:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
part is is when you go retail when when
 
05:55:13.788 --> 05:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
you look to go retail and that's the
 
05:55:16.110 --> 05:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
second part part two of this that opens
 
05:55:17.830 --> 05:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
up the whole can of worms in the state
 
05:55:19.788 --> 05:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
that where we're looking at repealing
 
05:55:24.910 --> 05:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
427 2A 1B however by going retail now
 
05:55:27.230 --> 05:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
that opens up the obligations to meet
 
05:55:34.468 --> 05:55:34.478 align:start position:0%
RSA 1461 1463 1465 1469
 
05:55:37.948 --> 05:55:37.958 align:start position:0%
14611 1468 18
 
05:55:42.510 --> 05:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
14621 and then again RSA 427 2a1 C all
 
05:55:46.270 --> 05:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
these rsas go into labeling timeade
 
05:55:49.310 --> 05:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
production in inspection all of this is
 
05:55:51.510 --> 05:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
just State rules then earlier we were
 
05:55:53.830 --> 05:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
talking about the marijuana um question
 
05:55:56.548 --> 05:55:56.558 align:start position:0%
about what if we squeeze this by well
 
05:55:58.150 --> 05:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
they actually with this section they
 
05:56:01.750 --> 05:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
actually have a penalty section in 21
 
05:56:04.990 --> 05:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
USC United States code 21 title 21
 
05:56:08.230 --> 05:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
chapter 12 Subs section 661 which
 
05:56:10.910 --> 05:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
actually goes into the penalization of
 
05:56:13.868 --> 05:56:13.878 align:start position:0%
the state named for the governor of any
 
05:56:17.070 --> 05:56:17.080 align:start position:0%
violations of food inspection delay and
 
05:56:19.150 --> 05:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
of designation publication of Federal
 
05:56:21.270 --> 05:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
Register notice of production of
 
05:56:24.030 --> 05:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
alterated meat and meat food food
 
05:56:26.948 --> 05:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
products designated by the state not
 
05:56:29.030 --> 05:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
inspected so that's just that's just
 
05:56:31.150 --> 05:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
from the 21 USC so they do have a
 
05:56:33.548 --> 05:56:33.558 align:start position:0%
penalized section if we do not follow
 
05:56:36.510 --> 05:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
the federal law and um keep keeping it
 
05:56:39.110 --> 05:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
really quick um and you have copies of
 
05:56:41.230 --> 05:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
your oh I have I have yes and all those
 
05:56:44.030 --> 05:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
R essays we'd have to meet and so even
 
05:56:47.628 --> 05:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
if we passed this we and it went to we
 
05:56:49.510 --> 05:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
have a like I said the next very next
 
05:56:52.190 --> 05:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
RSA in that section VI with counters
 
05:56:54.070 --> 05:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
what's being repealed here and we would
 
05:56:56.230 --> 05:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
have to meet all these other rsas and
 
05:56:57.830 --> 05:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
have to do something with those to even
 
05:56:59.150 --> 05:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
be able to appeal it and that's state
 
05:57:01.350 --> 05:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
law okay thank you any questions
 
05:57:03.430 --> 05:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you madam
 
05:57:05.270 --> 05:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking questions um
 
05:57:07.788 --> 05:57:07.798 align:start position:0%
you've definitely out L your opposition
 
05:57:10.270 --> 05:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
to the bill it seems to me namely
 
05:57:12.190 --> 05:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
because there's so many other Byzantine
 
05:57:13.708 --> 05:57:13.718 align:start position:0%
laws on the books that we'd be in
 
05:57:16.670 --> 05:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
violation of but aside from that do you
 
05:57:20.548 --> 05:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
have any um any opinions on just the
 
05:57:23.350 --> 05:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill I do understand the
 
05:57:24.990 --> 05:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill and like I said I
 
05:57:27.868 --> 05:57:27.878 align:start position:0%
actually agree with cinder in um inis is
 
05:57:31.708 --> 05:57:31.718 align:start position:0%
that uh um a way of marketing I
 
05:57:33.150 --> 05:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
understand Customs Slaughter and I know
 
05:57:35.110 --> 05:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
earlier was the definition of what it is
 
05:57:37.030 --> 05:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
it's basically that's the way I think a
 
05:57:38.788 --> 05:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
lot of your home your home restaurant
 
05:57:41.750 --> 05:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
stores go is that they actually buy the
 
05:57:43.830 --> 05:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
whole cow take it to the place get it
 
05:57:45.750 --> 05:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
slaughtered and then get it back that's
 
05:57:47.270 --> 05:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
exactly what custom Slaughter goes here
 
05:57:48.548 --> 05:57:48.558 align:start position:0%
we have I have one actually down the
 
05:57:50.230 --> 05:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
street from me that does that exact
 
05:57:51.430 --> 05:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
thing you take them maau they'll
 
05:57:53.670 --> 05:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
Slaughter it for you and then and then
 
05:57:55.150 --> 05:57:55.160 align:start position:0%
charge you a price to slaughter it and
 
05:57:57.510 --> 05:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
give it back to you all the two sides of
 
05:57:59.310 --> 05:57:59.320 align:start position:0%
beef you get plus what a however you
 
05:58:03.628 --> 05:58:03.638 align:start position:0%
wanted um but as far as uh I do agree
 
05:58:06.390 --> 05:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
with it that if there's a if there's a
 
05:58:08.590 --> 05:58:08.600 align:start position:0%
certain way to get around this yes it
 
05:58:11.310 --> 05:58:11.320 align:start position:0%
would I think it would take a at least
 
05:58:13.190 --> 05:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
to get around all these different bill
 
05:58:16.708 --> 05:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
um different rsas it would take a
 
05:58:19.750 --> 05:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
heavily Amendment amended bill that
 
05:58:22.830 --> 05:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
would um somehow you'd have to negate
 
05:58:25.270 --> 05:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
the labeling requirements the time the
 
05:58:26.990 --> 05:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
freezer time I mean the different
 
05:58:28.750 --> 05:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
inspection qualities that always
 
05:58:30.670 --> 05:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
required once you go retail there's a
 
05:58:32.510 --> 05:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
lot of different stipulations in there
 
05:58:36.230 --> 05:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead sorry represent Potenza
 
05:58:37.548 --> 05:58:37.558 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair thank you for
 
05:58:40.110 --> 05:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question so all of those rsas
 
05:58:43.070 --> 05:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
that you um were talking about were all
 
05:58:45.510 --> 05:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
based upon like if it was retail though
 
05:58:47.868 --> 05:58:47.878 align:start position:0%
correct as soon as they sell it to a
 
05:58:50.628 --> 05:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
store restaurant Hotel any of that
 
05:58:53.990 --> 05:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
section two okay thank you very right
 
05:58:55.030 --> 05:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:58:57.708 --> 05:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for
 
05:59:02.868 --> 05:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
coming to testify today I call Sean
 
05:59:05.390 --> 05:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
Bader good afternoon and welcome to
 
05:59:07.628 --> 05:59:07.638 align:start position:0%
environment Agriculture and you have
 
05:59:11.310 --> 05:59:11.320 align:start position:0%
three minutes good afternoon um I tell
 
05:59:12.708 --> 05:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
us where you're your name and where
 
05:59:15.390 --> 05:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
you're from I'm sea Bader I'm owner
 
05:59:18.750 --> 05:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
operator of Bader Farm we are uh we
 
05:59:22.270 --> 05:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
raise cattle uh swine
 
05:59:26.350 --> 05:59:26.360 align:start position:0%
and poultry and we are also a custom cut
 
05:59:29.788 --> 05:59:29.798 align:start position:0%
shop okay um I hear it all the time from
 
05:59:32.430 --> 05:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
my customers I wish I could
 
05:59:37.350 --> 05:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
sell a steak or a package of B bacon or
 
05:59:41.110 --> 05:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
a package of sausage all the time
 
05:59:44.110 --> 05:59:44.120 align:start position:0%
and this is a huge problem for us
 
05:59:46.548 --> 05:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
because in the industry as a small
 
05:59:49.468 --> 05:59:49.478 align:start position:0%
farmer you can't always find all the
 
05:59:52.868 --> 05:59:52.878 align:start position:0%
people to buy an entire cow so you sell
 
05:59:54.230 --> 05:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
three quarters of the cow and I get
 
05:59:56.230 --> 05:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
stuck with the last quarter well you do
 
05:59:57.670 --> 05:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
that two or three
 
06:00:00.948 --> 06:00:00.958 align:start position:0%
times I got a lot of food in my freezer
 
06:00:03.750 --> 06:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
do you know what I mean so it offers us
 
06:00:05.270 --> 06:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to make a little bit more
 
06:00:07.230 --> 06:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
money which allows us to expand our
 
06:00:09.750 --> 06:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
business a little bit more it offers our
 
06:00:12.350 --> 06:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
customers the opportunity to you know
 
06:00:15.030 --> 06:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
our Slaughter customers the opportunity
 
06:00:19.230 --> 06:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
to be more flexible with their product
 
06:00:21.990 --> 06:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
and do a little better on their end as
 
06:00:25.030 --> 06:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
well being able to sell by the cut which
 
06:00:26.750 --> 06:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
helps them offset their costs and grow
 
06:00:28.868 --> 06:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
their operation farming is a really hard
 
06:00:31.270 --> 06:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
operation to grow if you can't retail
 
06:00:34.510 --> 06:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
product it costs you know you're giving
 
06:00:36.990 --> 06:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
deals to everybody for a large quantity
 
06:00:39.270 --> 06:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
and those large quantities don't always
 
06:00:41.548 --> 06:00:41.558 align:start position:0%
repeat you know what I mean
 
06:00:44.430 --> 06:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
so if I sell half a cow to somebody and
 
06:00:47.430 --> 06:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
it's a particular like an elderly couple
 
06:00:48.910 --> 06:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
husband and wife they don't eat a lot of
 
06:00:50.670 --> 06:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
food that cow will last them two years
 
06:00:54.788 --> 06:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
that half a cow so that's not steady
 
06:00:55.990 --> 06:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
business for us and it doesn't
 
06:00:59.230 --> 06:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily make sense for them right so
 
06:01:00.990 --> 06:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
for them they're looking
 
06:01:03.990 --> 06:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
to come in buy a couple of stakes for
 
06:01:06.030 --> 06:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
this week
 
06:01:08.548 --> 06:01:08.558 align:start position:0%
come in buy a couple of chicken breasts
 
06:01:10.628 --> 06:01:10.638 align:start position:0%
this week you know or whatever it is do
 
06:01:12.510 --> 06:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
their grocery shopping from somebody
 
06:01:14.750 --> 06:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
local that they trust a product that
 
06:01:16.990 --> 06:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
they've created I mean let's be
 
06:01:21.070 --> 06:01:21.080 align:start position:0%
honest this bill is just is in in my
 
06:01:22.990 --> 06:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
opinion it's intended to basically do
 
06:01:24.590 --> 06:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
the same exemption that poultry has
 
06:01:24.600 --> 06:01:25.430 align:start position:0%
the same exemption that poultry has
right

06:01:25.430 --> 06:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:01:28.070 --> 06:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
now poultry can be sold to restaurants
 
06:01:30.990 --> 06:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
and and hotels it can be sold at local
 
06:01:33.390 --> 06:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
markets not Market Basket cuz Market
 
06:01:35.948 --> 06:01:35.958 align:start position:0%
basket's a distribution center so they
 
06:01:38.310 --> 06:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
go interestate interstate not
 
06:01:40.868 --> 06:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
interestate so that would eliminate the
 
06:01:42.990 --> 06:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
big stores the Walmarts the market
 
06:01:45.270 --> 06:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
baskets the victories or Haniford or
 
06:01:46.510 --> 06:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
what stop and shops they would be
 
06:01:48.990 --> 06:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
eliminated from that that option so
 
06:01:50.510 --> 06:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's not really the concern that we're
 
06:01:53.628 --> 06:01:53.638 align:start position:0%
looking at this is multiple levels of
 
06:01:57.430 --> 06:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
customer direct basically so if I am a
 
06:02:01.310 --> 06:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
custom cut shop and I cut for Betty Lou
 
06:02:04.628 --> 06:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
Betty Lou sells to John Smith John Smith
 
06:02:06.430 --> 06:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
is the End customer
 
06:02:08.548 --> 06:02:08.558 align:start position:0%
you do you see what I'm saying if I sell
 
06:02:11.110 --> 06:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
it to the hotel down the street the bed
 
06:02:13.350 --> 06:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
and breakfast down the street and they
 
06:02:15.430 --> 06:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
produce it for their customers their
 
06:02:15.440 --> 06:02:17.230 align:start position:0%
produce it for their customers their
customers

06:02:17.230 --> 06:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
customers
 
06:02:19.750 --> 06:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
the the end of the line it's not going
 
06:02:22.430 --> 06:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
into a retail chain it is going customer
 
06:02:26.150 --> 06:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
direct either from our custom slaughter
 
06:02:29.270 --> 06:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
house or from our customer's porch or
 
06:02:30.510 --> 06:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
whatever it might
 
06:02:34.270 --> 06:02:34.280 align:start position:0%
be does that make sense yeah so I I
 
06:02:38.310 --> 06:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
don't see the purpose of making such a
 
06:02:41.708 --> 06:02:41.718 align:start position:0%
big stink over Beef Pork and and Lambs
 
06:02:43.190 --> 06:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
when we do all of this stuff with
 
06:02:45.990 --> 06:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
chicken right now and chicken is way
 
06:02:48.190 --> 06:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
more difficult to keep
 
06:02:52.390 --> 06:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
safe than beef pork or Lambs okay thank
 
06:02:55.190 --> 06:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
you time's up representative Bixby yes
 
06:02:59.590 --> 06:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
so um representative inis mentioned uh a
 
06:03:01.670 --> 06:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
possibility that he'd heard of uh that
 
06:03:06.990 --> 06:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
he'd um heard from uh commissioner
 
06:03:09.590 --> 06:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
Jasper uh and he didn't have the details
 
06:03:12.390 --> 06:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
but something about um roping USDA
 
06:03:17.230 --> 06:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
inspectors who would be able to uh do uh
 
06:03:18.708 --> 06:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
part-time inspection part-time
 
06:03:21.990 --> 06:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
inspection of uh at custom meat houses
 
06:03:23.948 --> 06:03:23.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change the basic custom
 
06:03:25.830 --> 06:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
operation but it would allow you to do
 
06:03:29.990 --> 06:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
to have USD da inspected meet uh I would
 
06:03:31.430 --> 06:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
still have to go through all of the
 
06:03:34.230 --> 06:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
basis of becoming a USDA inspected
 
06:03:36.350 --> 06:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
facility I would only
 
06:03:38.708 --> 06:03:38.718 align:start position:0%
employ them part-time so they would
 
06:03:40.190 --> 06:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
still need the infrastructure we would
 
06:03:41.548 --> 06:03:41.558 align:start position:0%
still need the hasset plans we would
 
06:03:43.948 --> 06:03:43.958 align:start position:0%
still need all of the safety measures
 
06:03:46.788 --> 06:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
and and things put into place which are
 
06:03:49.150 --> 06:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
very costly to come up with I've looked
 
06:03:52.910 --> 06:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
into it and not only that I'm a small
 
06:03:54.510 --> 06:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
operation so there's a lot of days we
 
06:03:55.830 --> 06:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
run over eight
 
06:03:59.548 --> 06:03:59.558 align:start position:0%
hours after eight hours if I'm an
 
06:04:02.070 --> 06:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
inspected facility I now have to pay
 
06:04:04.868 --> 06:04:04.878 align:start position:0%
$365 an hour for that inspector to be
 
06:04:04.878 --> 06:04:06.868 align:start position:0%
$365 an hour for that inspector to be
present

06:04:06.868 --> 06:04:06.878 align:start position:0%
present
 
06:04:08.670 --> 06:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
how does that become cost effective for
 
06:04:11.788 --> 06:04:11.798 align:start position:0%
me right do you know what I mean okay
 
06:04:13.430 --> 06:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
that that's it's a hardship yeah that
 
06:04:14.590 --> 06:04:14.600 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a very important
 
06:04:16.548 --> 06:04:16.558 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you and
 
06:04:21.190 --> 06:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
honestly this isn't like 1967 where if I
 
06:04:22.788 --> 06:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
did something wrong it takes two years
 
06:04:24.270 --> 06:04:24.280 align:start position:0%
for everybody to find out about it
 
06:04:25.948 --> 06:04:25.958 align:start position:0%
unless it's front page news on the
 
06:04:28.310 --> 06:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
newspaper it'll be on Facebook tomorrow
 
06:04:31.350 --> 06:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
and 10,000 people will hear
 
06:04:34.310 --> 06:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
it okay represent
 
06:04:36.390 --> 06:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
Penza uh than thank you madam chair
 
06:04:39.070 --> 06:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
06:04:40.390 --> 06:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
want to
 
06:04:42.590 --> 06:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
understand when you said okay so
 
06:04:45.548 --> 06:04:45.558 align:start position:0%
someone's let's say they buy half a cow
 
06:04:48.110 --> 06:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
and you know you're you can buy as small
 
06:04:50.548 --> 06:04:50.558 align:start position:0%
as a quarter cow a quarter okay so well
 
06:04:53.590 --> 06:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
let's just say a half and then you still
 
06:04:56.030 --> 06:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
you're left with a quarter and then
 
06:04:58.510 --> 06:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
you're having to freeze that first
 
06:04:59.468 --> 06:04:59.478 align:start position:0%
question that has to be for my
 
06:05:03.830 --> 06:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
consumption correct how um how long does
 
06:05:06.430 --> 06:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
that last un unless you have like a a
 
06:05:08.590 --> 06:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
deep freeze process like how long is
 
06:05:10.030 --> 06:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
that meat good
 
06:05:14.350 --> 06:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
for um vacuum sealed 2 to 3 years really
 
06:05:15.670 --> 06:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
as long as the packaging doesn't get
 
06:05:18.868 --> 06:05:18.878 align:start position:0%
damaged wow okay followup oh I didn't
 
06:05:22.670 --> 06:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
realize that okay so let's say I have
 
06:05:24.910 --> 06:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
like there's this I don't even know what
 
06:05:26.510 --> 06:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's called it's this like little shop
 
06:05:29.270 --> 06:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
that sells all local products it's in
 
06:05:32.310 --> 06:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
hooks it it's right off of the exit um
 
06:05:34.548 --> 06:05:34.558 align:start position:0%
they have like local PL pies all that
 
06:05:38.590 --> 06:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff if they bought half a half
 
06:05:41.430 --> 06:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
a cow or something like that and they're
 
06:05:45.868 --> 06:05:45.878 align:start position:0%
selling um you know they can't they then
 
06:05:48.150 --> 06:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
can't take that cut it up and there
 
06:05:50.548 --> 06:05:50.558 align:start position:0%
where it stops correct so they're not
 
06:05:52.310 --> 06:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that either the name on
 
06:05:54.708 --> 06:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
that animal when it's killed is where it
 
06:05:58.030 --> 06:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
stops right now unless it's poultry
 
06:06:00.150 --> 06:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
unless it's which yes like which makes
 
06:06:04.510 --> 06:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
no sense which is a lot yeah it's it's a
 
06:06:06.830 --> 06:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
way more dangerous problem
 
06:06:08.390 --> 06:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
okay any other
 
06:06:11.670 --> 06:06:11.680 align:start position:0%

06:06:58.628 --> 06:06:58.638 align:start position:0%
passing state laws that conflict with
 
06:07:01.070 --> 06:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
federal law as this bill does is a
 
06:07:03.150 --> 06:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
solution uh I've been
 
06:07:06.430 --> 06:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
before you folks I can't tell you how
 
06:07:08.910 --> 06:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
many times over the last 25 years when
 
06:07:11.190 --> 06:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
it comes to some pesticide laws that are
 
06:07:12.750 --> 06:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
proposed I think of the some food
 
06:07:15.708 --> 06:07:15.718 align:start position:0%
Freedom bills there was Senator in's
 
06:07:17.750 --> 06:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill from last year Senate B 494 in his
 
06:07:20.990 --> 06:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
committee that we have opposed for that
 
06:07:23.868 --> 06:07:23.878 align:start position:0%
reason um if pass we're putting our
 
06:07:26.910 --> 06:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
farmers in a position of USDA
 
06:07:30.270 --> 06:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement um think of insurance and
 
06:07:32.390 --> 06:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
product liability where they think
 
06:07:34.430 --> 06:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
they're covered and their insurance is
 
06:07:36.750 --> 06:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
wait a second you there's a yeah the
 
06:07:38.190 --> 06:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
state law state allows you to do that
 
06:07:40.670 --> 06:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
but the federal government doesn't that
 
06:07:43.150 --> 06:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
there's uh it's confusing it's been
 
06:07:47.110 --> 06:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there are uh uh raw milk
 
06:07:47.120 --> 06:07:48.070 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there are uh uh raw milk
and

06:07:48.070 --> 06:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:07:50.830 --> 06:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
poultry yes there are exemptions but
 
06:07:52.910 --> 06:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
there are exemptions under federal law
 
06:07:57.190 --> 06:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
that are Ena currently enabled in in in
 
06:07:59.910 --> 06:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
replacing the bill we' like to see the
 
06:08:01.430 --> 06:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
committee moved forward with a
 
06:08:04.830 --> 06:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
resolution uh urging the our United
 
06:08:06.830 --> 06:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
States Congress to pass legislation and
 
06:08:09.468 --> 06:08:09.478 align:start position:0%
or the US Department of Agriculture to
 
06:08:11.190 --> 06:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
to adopt regulations supporting
 
06:08:12.830 --> 06:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility in Meet inspection
 
06:08:14.628 --> 06:08:14.638 align:start position:0%
regulations particularly we're talking
 
06:08:17.190 --> 06:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
about Beef Pork and lamb that were sold
 
06:08:19.390 --> 06:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
directly from the farm producer to the
 
06:08:21.230 --> 06:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
consumer and thank you for your time and
 
06:08:22.910 --> 06:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
attention I know you've got a number of
 
06:08:25.230 --> 06:08:25.240 align:start position:0%
folks that like to speak with you thank
 
06:08:26.510 --> 06:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
you okay any questions from the
 
06:08:28.990 --> 06:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
committee representative Bixby I believe
 
06:08:31.750 --> 06:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
that the last uh term at the federal
 
06:08:34.270 --> 06:08:34.280 align:start position:0%
level there was a law that was trying to
 
06:08:36.310 --> 06:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
get at this and do you know if the
 
06:08:39.468 --> 06:08:39.478 align:start position:0%
similar law has been U the prime act
 
06:08:41.310 --> 06:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
yeah the prime act yeah it didn't it did
 
06:08:43.750 --> 06:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
not go anywhere but and and and no one's
 
06:08:45.628 --> 06:08:45.638 align:start position:0%
trying it again this term no uh I
 
06:08:47.310 --> 06:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
haven't seen anything yet I wouldn't be
 
06:08:49.590 --> 06:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
surprised if they did and I I know our
 
06:08:51.150 --> 06:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
our our president Joyce Brady is going
 
06:08:52.868 --> 06:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
to be here and she's going to touch on
 
06:08:54.548 --> 06:08:54.558 align:start position:0%
on that a little bit I think okay thank
 
06:08:57.030 --> 06:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
you okay any other questions
 
06:08:59.190 --> 06:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
representative gerana thank you madam
 
06:09:00.468 --> 06:09:00.478 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question I
 
06:09:03.350 --> 06:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
was just curious because of the the very
 
06:09:05.150 --> 06:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
helpful testimony the last individual
 
06:09:07.030 --> 06:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
test could you tell us something about
 
06:09:09.350 --> 06:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
the history I didn't know about poultry
 
06:09:11.670 --> 06:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
not having to conform to these kind of
 
06:09:14.350 --> 06:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
same uh same inspection guidelines so
 
06:09:15.708 --> 06:09:15.718 align:start position:0%
could could you give us a little bit of
 
06:09:17.390 --> 06:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
the history of why that distinction
 
06:09:19.750 --> 06:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
exists in law well I think you go back
 
06:09:21.948 --> 06:09:21.958 align:start position:0%
to the the Meat Inspection statues the
 
06:09:23.310 --> 06:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
federal inspection statues and they came
 
06:09:26.030 --> 06:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
on the books in the late 60s I think it
 
06:09:27.948 --> 06:09:27.958 align:start position:0%
what I've read and heard it was a matter
 
06:09:29.708 --> 06:09:29.718 align:start position:0%
of where there are a heck of a lot of
 
06:09:31.830 --> 06:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
small poultry producers around that
 
06:09:33.750 --> 06:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
wanted the ability to sell direct and
 
06:09:36.590 --> 06:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
were able to fend off basically the the
 
06:09:38.750 --> 06:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
the federal law is kind of what I've and
 
06:09:41.708 --> 06:09:41.718 align:start position:0%
that's up to 20,000 birds that you so
 
06:09:43.190 --> 06:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's there's a there's one exemption
 
06:09:44.948 --> 06:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
up to a thousand then it's another up to
 
06:09:48.948 --> 06:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
20 that that enables all right thank you
 
06:09:51.110 --> 06:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think that's something what
 
06:09:52.910 --> 06:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
many of us would like to see with some
 
06:09:55.830 --> 06:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
legislation you know that Federal level
 
06:09:58.030 --> 06:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
would you believe that the a number of
 
06:10:00.948 --> 06:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
those uh producers that were raising
 
06:10:03.190 --> 06:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
roughly 20,000 birds were in fact
 
06:10:06.030 --> 06:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
members of the US Congress
 
06:10:09.230 --> 06:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
that that would not be surprising either
 
06:10:12.590 --> 06:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
yes any other questions representative
 
06:10:15.270 --> 06:10:15.280 align:start position:0%

06:10:45.030 --> 06:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
mozzo thank you very much good afternoon
 
06:10:47.548 --> 06:10:47.558 align:start position:0%
my name is Amy mozzo my husband Brian
 
06:10:49.830 --> 06:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
and I own and operate Lauren Joyce Farm
 
06:10:52.910 --> 06:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
in Barnstead on our farm we sell beef
 
06:10:55.750 --> 06:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
raw milk products and eggs we have been
 
06:10:58.150 --> 06:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
selling beef direct to Consumer for 10
 
06:11:00.910 --> 06:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
years I'm the primary operator of our
 
06:11:03.150 --> 06:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
farm and my husband works as a forestry
 
06:11:05.750 --> 06:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
mechanic for a large Logging Company as
 
06:11:07.708 --> 06:11:07.718 align:start position:0%
a homeschooling mom and a full-time
 
06:11:09.788 --> 06:11:09.798 align:start position:0%
farmer I took the time today to come
 
06:11:11.708 --> 06:11:11.718 align:start position:0%
speak to the committee because I want
 
06:11:13.910 --> 06:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
you to understand how large of an issue
 
06:11:16.190 --> 06:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
this is for New Hampshire farmers and
 
06:11:19.430 --> 06:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
for food security this bill could be
 
06:11:22.150 --> 06:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
crucial for small farms to continue
 
06:11:25.030 --> 06:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
farming because there are so few usca
 
06:11:28.190 --> 06:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
butchers in New Hampshire on our farm we
 
06:11:31.868 --> 06:11:31.878 align:start position:0%
have sold beef by the cut and wholesale
 
06:11:34.350 --> 06:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
we started selling beef at local farmers
 
06:11:37.868 --> 06:11:37.878 align:start position:0%
markets Farm stands such as the one in
 
06:11:40.190 --> 06:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
hooks it that you were talking about and
 
06:11:43.590 --> 06:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
now only from our farm we have used two
 
06:11:47.230 --> 06:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
USDA inspected butchers and four custom
 
06:11:50.468 --> 06:11:50.478 align:start position:0%
butchers in the last 10 years many of
 
06:11:52.830 --> 06:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
our customers now struggle to afford to
 
06:11:56.750 --> 06:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
buy meat buy the cut with the economy
 
06:11:59.750 --> 06:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
they're barely getting by it's very hard
 
06:12:03.190 --> 06:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
for a family to afford a $5,000 cow even
 
06:12:06.628 --> 06:12:06.638 align:start position:0%
once a year we need to be the sell cuts
 
06:12:08.948 --> 06:12:08.958 align:start position:0%
that have been processed at a non USDA
 
06:12:11.030 --> 06:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
shop with the right
 
06:12:13.670 --> 06:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
protocols we have had both great and
 
06:12:16.750 --> 06:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
very bad experiences using both USDA and
 
06:12:19.590 --> 06:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
custom shops most important reason why
 
06:12:21.430 --> 06:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
we're here today whether you oppose or
 
06:12:23.468 --> 06:12:23.478 align:start position:0%
support the bill is to recognize that
 
06:12:26.270 --> 06:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
human health and meat safety needs to be
 
06:12:29.390 --> 06:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
our number one priority I'm dedicated to
 
06:12:31.310 --> 06:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
raising and selling the highest quality
 
06:12:34.590 --> 06:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
meat I possibly can and do never do not
 
06:12:37.070 --> 06:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
ever want to make someone sick last
 
06:12:39.750 --> 06:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
summer we were using the USDA facility
 
06:12:43.230 --> 06:12:43.240 align:start position:0%
that representative comto spoke about
 
06:12:45.390 --> 06:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
what we experienced was unlike anything
 
06:12:48.350 --> 06:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
I've ever seen my heart's desire is not
 
06:12:50.670 --> 06:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
to go against the government or
 
06:12:54.750 --> 06:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
authority but I can't get behind corrupt
 
06:12:56.590 --> 06:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
government allowing what happened at
 
06:12:59.430 --> 06:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
this facility and it was
 
06:13:01.990 --> 06:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
wrong we were one of the Farms who had
 
06:13:04.310 --> 06:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
to lose sleep daily concerned that our
 
06:13:06.468 --> 06:13:06.478 align:start position:0%
meat was going to make make someone sick
 
06:13:08.030 --> 06:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
over the years I have always thought
 
06:13:10.628 --> 06:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
that using a USDA facility was truly the
 
06:13:12.910 --> 06:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
only way to ensure that my meat was safe
 
06:13:15.910 --> 06:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
and properly handled but sadly I do not
 
06:13:18.110 --> 06:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
feel that way anymore and I'm very angry
 
06:13:20.708 --> 06:13:20.718 align:start position:0%
with the USDA during the summer the
 
06:13:22.788 --> 06:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
weight times on our beef kept coming
 
06:13:25.670 --> 06:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
back longer and longer the individual
 
06:13:27.708 --> 06:13:27.718 align:start position:0%
managing the facility continued to tell
 
06:13:30.510 --> 06:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
me that they dry AED their beef so mine
 
06:13:33.430 --> 06:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
would be fine they never once asked me
 
06:13:35.390 --> 06:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
if I was okay with my beef being
 
06:13:38.628 --> 06:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
dry-aged hanging 3 to 4 weeks the answer
 
06:13:41.230 --> 06:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
would have been no there was not enough
 
06:13:43.750 --> 06:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
space to dry age the beef and the
 
06:13:46.150 --> 06:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
animals and the volume of animals that
 
06:13:47.590 --> 06:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
were being pushed
 
06:13:51.070 --> 06:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
through I'm sorry your time's up okay
 
06:13:52.948 --> 06:13:52.958 align:start position:0%
would you just
 
06:13:55.830 --> 06:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
conclude um I just wanted to talk about
 
06:13:57.788 --> 06:13:57.798 align:start position:0%
how I've had a negative experience at a
 
06:14:02.548 --> 06:14:02.558 align:start position:0%
custom shop too but overall a lot can go
 
06:14:06.310 --> 06:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
wrong at both USDA and C some facilities
 
06:14:09.190 --> 06:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
so we need proper guidelines and
 
06:14:11.948 --> 06:14:11.958 align:start position:0%
amendments to make this bill safe so
 
06:14:15.070 --> 06:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
that um New Hampshire meat will be safe
 
06:14:18.868 --> 06:14:18.878 align:start position:0%
no matter who consumes it okay thank you
 
06:14:20.230 --> 06:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
06:14:20.240 --> 06:14:22.468 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
representative

06:14:22.468 --> 06:14:22.478 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:14:24.750 --> 06:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair and thank
 
06:14:28.270 --> 06:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um can you
 
06:14:31.990 --> 06:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
can you explain what happened
 
06:14:34.868 --> 06:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
um they basically I'm not familiar with
 
06:14:36.910 --> 06:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
this of course this is your business not
 
06:14:40.830 --> 06:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
mine you said that the USDA facility was
 
06:14:43.390 --> 06:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
like hanging the meat for how
 
06:14:47.350 --> 06:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
long so the facility was not properly
 
06:14:50.350 --> 06:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
managed and they were overbooking
 
06:14:52.830 --> 06:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
themselves and they were over capacity
 
06:14:54.750 --> 06:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
and they were also dry aging their own
 
06:14:57.110 --> 06:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
beef in the facility which had mold on
 
06:15:01.670 --> 06:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
it and so the carcasses like mine were
 
06:15:04.030 --> 06:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
being hung too long and they had
 
06:15:07.230 --> 06:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
excessive mold growth on them and in
 
06:15:10.110 --> 06:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
order for that product to be packaged
 
06:15:12.708 --> 06:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
they were hacking all of the 6 in of
 
06:15:15.830 --> 06:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
mold off the beef and then packaging
 
06:15:21.788 --> 06:15:21.798 align:start position:0%
what was left oh my goodness followup
 
06:15:24.990 --> 06:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
followup okay so let's say if what you
 
06:15:28.190 --> 06:15:28.200 align:start position:0%
brought them was worth like after they
 
06:15:29.548 --> 06:15:29.558 align:start position:0%
were doing what they were going to do
 
06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
and if it was done right and on time
 
06:15:35.150 --> 06:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
$11,000 what did that just take off of
 
06:15:35.160 --> 06:15:36.150 align:start position:0%
$11,000 what did that just take off of
your

06:15:36.150 --> 06:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
your
 
06:15:39.350 --> 06:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
$1,000 do you know what I'm saying yes
 
06:15:42.990 --> 06:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um $1,000
 
06:15:45.468 --> 06:15:45.478 align:start position:0%
isn't really so look at an animal it's
 
06:15:46.590 --> 06:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
probably worth
 
06:15:49.510 --> 06:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
$5,000 to the consumer if you buy it by
 
06:15:52.310 --> 06:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
the whole um it depends on what the
 
06:15:56.310 --> 06:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
yields are my yields average around 62%
 
06:15:59.510 --> 06:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
on a beef and some of the ones that were
 
06:16:01.350 --> 06:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
having a lot of mold cut off were
 
06:16:03.350 --> 06:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
yielding in the 40s so they're
 
06:16:07.548 --> 06:16:07.558 align:start position:0%
essentially you know stealing from
 
06:16:09.948 --> 06:16:09.958 align:start position:0%
Farmers and you didn't get any money
 
06:16:13.708 --> 06:16:13.718 align:start position:0%
back from that all their problems that
 
06:16:16.310 --> 06:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
they caused you lost all of that there's
 
06:16:19.868 --> 06:16:19.878 align:start position:0%
no recouping of anything from from their
 
06:16:23.230 --> 06:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
mistakes correct yep and in the 10 years
 
06:16:25.590 --> 06:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
that I've sold beef um whenever there's
 
06:16:28.430 --> 06:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
an issue it's always my problem and my
 
06:16:30.350 --> 06:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
family like I was going to talk about
 
06:16:32.910 --> 06:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
the custom issue we had a gentleman that
 
06:16:35.270 --> 06:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
we were doing business with he damaged
 
06:16:38.868 --> 06:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
hundreds of pounds of our hamburger and
 
06:16:42.548 --> 06:16:42.558 align:start position:0%
we because it was a custom situation too
 
06:16:46.110 --> 06:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
um we we had to eat it
 
06:16:50.070 --> 06:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
so selling meat as a farmer is not all
 
06:16:53.350 --> 06:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
you know happy
 
06:16:57.628 --> 06:16:57.638 align:start position:0%
roses okay any other questions from the
 
06:16:59.830 --> 06:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much for coming
 
06:17:02.270 --> 06:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
and telling us that aspect of uh of this
 
06:17:05.350 --> 06:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
meat processing process yes app thank
 
06:17:07.190 --> 06:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity do you have
 
06:17:08.830 --> 06:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
written testimony that you can share
 
06:17:12.510 --> 06:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
with us even if it's written hand okay
 
06:17:20.190 --> 06:17:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:22.910 --> 06:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
fine okay thank
 
06:17:25.910 --> 06:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
you uh call Gary
 
06:17:30.628 --> 06:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:33.590 --> 06:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
Deerfield okay please tell us your name
 
06:17:35.670 --> 06:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
where you're from and
 
06:17:37.868 --> 06:17:37.878 align:start position:0%
it's a Gary sandborn Willowdale Farm
 
06:17:39.750 --> 06:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
Deerfield New Hampshire I'm ninth
 
06:17:44.110 --> 06:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
generation on our farm um we have used
 
06:17:46.030 --> 06:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
Daryl Robinson East Conway beef before
 
06:17:48.708 --> 06:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
he burned while he burned we had to go
 
06:17:50.548 --> 06:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
to another facility two different ones
 
06:17:53.750 --> 06:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
the two we used were not USDA we had
 
06:17:56.270 --> 06:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
horrible experiences we lost two cows at
 
06:17:59.390 --> 06:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
one facility it was not cooled properly
 
06:18:01.190 --> 06:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
same idea the mold was growing on it and
 
06:18:03.230 --> 06:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
I refused to take the animals I made
 
06:18:04.830 --> 06:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
them pay for the animals I never got f
 
06:18:06.708 --> 06:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
paid for them I went to another facility
 
06:18:09.510 --> 06:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
that was not USDA with five pigs there
 
06:18:12.590 --> 06:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
when I walked in to pick up our animals
 
06:18:14.350 --> 06:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
the girl was smoking a cigarette in one
 
06:18:16.750 --> 06:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
hand putting bags handles of meat in
 
06:18:19.270 --> 06:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
bags without gloves on and flies flying
 
06:18:20.230 --> 06:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
around the
 
06:18:22.270 --> 06:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
room while I'm sitting there watching
 
06:18:23.788 --> 06:18:23.798 align:start position:0%
her and she makes a comment I should
 
06:18:25.510 --> 06:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
probably go get my gloves but they're
 
06:18:28.070 --> 06:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
too far away they're 50 feet away I says
 
06:18:29.990 --> 06:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
well I hope those aren't my animals and
 
06:18:32.270 --> 06:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
I walked in the next door it was still
 
06:18:35.350 --> 06:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
in the Breezeway there was a tub of um
 
06:18:37.750 --> 06:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
hams not covered not in plastic just
 
06:18:39.110 --> 06:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
sitting there with flies flying around
 
06:18:40.910 --> 06:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
them so that's the first two places I
 
06:18:43.788 --> 06:18:43.798 align:start position:0%
used after Daryl burn down so we stopped
 
06:18:45.868 --> 06:18:45.878 align:start position:0%
processing our animals we had 150 head
 
06:18:47.910 --> 06:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
at that time we were not doing anything
 
06:18:49.628 --> 06:18:49.638 align:start position:0%
until Daryl opened back up Daryl's here
 
06:18:52.910 --> 06:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
today me Conway so those two incidences
 
06:18:55.150 --> 06:18:55.160 align:start position:0%
were horrible we are licensed to sell by
 
06:18:57.628 --> 06:18:57.638 align:start position:0%
the pound off our farm individual Cuts
 
06:19:00.788 --> 06:19:00.798 align:start position:0%
holes Hales quarters we were selling to
 
06:19:02.910 --> 06:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
restaurants a bed and breakfast and
 
06:19:05.350 --> 06:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
several stores before Co we were selling
 
06:19:06.990 --> 06:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
high-end stores in Manchester good
 
06:19:09.350 --> 06:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
high-end restaurants and I would not use
 
06:19:12.830 --> 06:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
a non USDA facility whatsoever for no
 
06:19:15.110 --> 06:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
reason I know two or three people that
 
06:19:17.390 --> 06:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
do it in their backyard the sanitation
 
06:19:20.468 --> 06:19:20.478 align:start position:0%
is even not even close to what USDA is
 
06:19:22.070 --> 06:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's been some very outlandish facts
 
06:19:24.030 --> 06:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
here thrown around about USDA and what
 
06:19:25.468 --> 06:19:25.478 align:start position:0%
they've lost and what what they have
 
06:19:28.430 --> 06:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
gone as far as against them which is not
 
06:19:30.430 --> 06:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
correct whatsoever from what we've seen
 
06:19:32.350 --> 06:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
we've seen firsthand different
 
06:19:34.788 --> 06:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
facilities USDA has been on top every
 
06:19:37.350 --> 06:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
single time yes there is always a 1%
 
06:19:38.708 --> 06:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
margin or small margin where something's
 
06:19:40.868 --> 06:19:40.878 align:start position:0%
going to go wrong it's inevitable but
 
06:19:42.990 --> 06:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
you can't take the health away of people
 
06:19:45.390 --> 06:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
their safety by taking away
 
06:19:48.548 --> 06:19:48.558 align:start position:0%
USDA um as far as what she was talking
 
06:19:50.430 --> 06:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
about with the mold was cut off that's
 
06:19:52.990 --> 06:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
not on the facility 100% they have a
 
06:19:55.750 --> 06:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
USDA inspector there every single day
 
06:19:57.750 --> 06:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
why did he not catch this he was not
 
06:20:00.788 --> 06:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
doing his job darl will testify today
 
06:20:02.270 --> 06:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
they have to take temperatures of the
 
06:20:04.990 --> 06:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
meat twice a day and record it if you're
 
06:20:06.910 --> 06:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
taking a temperature of a cow hanging up
 
06:20:08.548 --> 06:20:08.558 align:start position:0%
and this mold off it you pushed to that
 
06:20:10.510 --> 06:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
mold something ain't right and that
 
06:20:13.390 --> 06:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
inspector is at fault also the farm but
 
06:20:16.190 --> 06:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
also the safety in place has to be there
 
06:20:18.548 --> 06:20:18.558 align:start position:0%
now if the safety is not there for USDA
 
06:20:19.948 --> 06:20:19.958 align:start position:0%
what's the backyard guy going to do when
 
06:20:21.590 --> 06:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
he's cutting Corners he's got too many
 
06:20:22.990 --> 06:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
cows coming in too many pigs coming too
 
06:20:24.390 --> 06:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
many sheep and they're in a hurry to get
 
06:20:26.430 --> 06:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
these out the door are their sanitation
 
06:20:28.468 --> 06:20:28.478 align:start position:0%
going to be anywhere near proper I don't
 
06:20:31.910 --> 06:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
believe so but I've seen it not even
 
06:20:35.628 --> 06:20:35.638 align:start position:0%
close um we use USDA in our marketing
 
06:20:37.628 --> 06:20:37.638 align:start position:0%
it's a thing to brag about yes our meet
 
06:20:39.830 --> 06:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
is USDA that's one thing we can brag
 
06:20:41.468 --> 06:20:41.478 align:start position:0%
about it's done at a great facility
 
06:20:43.708 --> 06:20:43.718 align:start position:0%
we're there every two weeks around
 
06:20:45.868 --> 06:20:45.878 align:start position:0%
around the year every two weeks we're
 
06:20:47.390 --> 06:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
there I walk in drop off animals
 
06:20:49.430 --> 06:20:49.440 align:start position:0%

06:21:19.868 --> 06:21:19.878 align:start position:0%
um you know really um sad and yeah it's
 
06:21:22.270 --> 06:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
um it's a lot of information for a lot
 
06:21:24.990 --> 06:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
of us that we haven't heard before so
 
06:21:26.990 --> 06:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
you said to me that you didn't accept
 
06:21:29.110 --> 06:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
like those I think those two cows right
 
06:21:32.230 --> 06:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
corre so did you get reimbursed for that
 
06:21:33.390 --> 06:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
most of it to the point where I was
 
06:21:35.468 --> 06:21:35.478 align:start position:0%
comfortable enough
 
06:21:39.670 --> 06:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
so so if it's a USDA facility are they
 
06:21:42.190 --> 06:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
taking accountability if they screw up
 
06:21:44.830 --> 06:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely but a private
 
06:21:46.910 --> 06:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
place will not this one did not I'm not
 
06:21:48.590 --> 06:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
saying all of them like I said there is
 
06:21:49.868 --> 06:21:49.878 align:start position:0%
percentage where there's going to be a
 
06:21:51.230 --> 06:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
problem no matter what it is in this
 
06:21:55.310 --> 06:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
world this facility did not take care of
 
06:21:56.990 --> 06:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
it the correct way and we're out money
 
06:21:58.390 --> 06:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
but there again I'd rather be out the
 
06:22:00.270 --> 06:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
money then bring those animals into our
 
06:22:01.910 --> 06:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
place and resell them out of our free
 
06:22:03.270 --> 06:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
either Buy the Pound or buy the half and
 
06:22:05.430 --> 06:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
hold and get somebody sick I'd take the
 
06:22:07.270 --> 06:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
hit before I get somebody else sick
 
06:22:07.280 --> 06:22:09.070 align:start position:0%
hit before I get somebody else sick
followup

06:22:09.070 --> 06:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
followup
 
06:22:12.030 --> 06:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
sure so USDA facilities were following
 
06:22:13.590 --> 06:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
federal laws we're doing everything the
 
06:22:15.190 --> 06:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
right way everything's supposed to be
 
06:22:18.190 --> 06:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
you know clean all of that and safe so
 
06:22:22.350 --> 06:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
you know you're this is your business
 
06:22:24.350 --> 06:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
this is your livelihood on it so I don't
 
06:22:25.910 --> 06:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
understand how if we're doing everything
 
06:22:27.468 --> 06:22:27.478 align:start position:0%
that we're that you're doing everything
 
06:22:29.868 --> 06:22:29.878 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to do that if the other
 
06:22:31.548 --> 06:22:31.558 align:start position:0%
person screws up that's supposed to be
 
06:22:33.030 --> 06:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
following all these federal laws and
 
06:22:34.230 --> 06:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
everything like that that you wouldn't
 
06:22:37.030 --> 06:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
get reimbursed whole for that shouldn't
 
06:22:38.628 --> 06:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
there be some sort of insurance or
 
06:22:40.750 --> 06:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
something absolutely and if you have
 
06:22:43.750 --> 06:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
deep enough Pockets you sue the Butcher
 
06:22:46.670 --> 06:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
and get it back now followup for that
 
06:22:48.548 --> 06:22:48.558 align:start position:0%
was talking about there was a lawsuit
 
06:22:50.110 --> 06:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
brought against that
 
06:22:53.468 --> 06:22:53.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:55.708 --> 06:22:55.718 align:start position:0%
disappeared and that's
 
06:22:59.468 --> 06:22:59.478 align:start position:0%
fact disappear no the lawsuit
 
06:23:02.030 --> 06:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
disappeared they were paid to take it
 
06:23:05.270 --> 06:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
back so if you if you you
 
06:23:08.230 --> 06:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
experienced two different custom shops
 
06:23:11.548 --> 06:23:11.558 align:start position:0%
that were substandard in your
 
06:23:14.230 --> 06:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
eyes are they still in business yes
 
06:23:16.990 --> 06:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
ma'am do they still do robust business
 
06:23:19.788 --> 06:23:19.798 align:start position:0%
call State I did call a state uhhuh and
 
06:23:21.230 --> 06:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
I left it up to them I mean nothing I'm
 
06:23:23.110 --> 06:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
can do after that I actually had the
 
06:23:25.350 --> 06:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
gentleman give me the information from
 
06:23:27.350 --> 06:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
the company that fcked his cooler his
 
06:23:28.830 --> 06:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
cooler went down for a couple days it
 
06:23:32.750 --> 06:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
was low I was cooling too too low too
 
06:23:34.548 --> 06:23:34.558 align:start position:0%
hot a temperature so I called the the
 
06:23:36.030 --> 06:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
company the free of dire company that
 
06:23:37.910 --> 06:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
fixed his cooler and that gentleman said
 
06:23:39.590 --> 06:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
do not take those animals back they were
 
06:23:42.868 --> 06:23:42.878 align:start position:0%
at 48 degrees for a day and a half and
 
06:23:44.150 --> 06:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
you still wanted to sell them to me and
 
06:23:46.548 --> 06:23:46.558 align:start position:0%
that's when I refused
 
06:23:50.708 --> 06:23:50.718 align:start position:0%
them so clearly I mean they're in in
 
06:23:53.390 --> 06:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
many different areas just even from a
 
06:23:55.310 --> 06:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
state inspection or you know if you
 
06:23:56.510 --> 06:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
called somebody from the state and
 
06:23:58.750 --> 06:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
complained about it did people are not
 
06:24:03.190 --> 06:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
doing their jobs then to ensure that
 
06:24:05.868 --> 06:24:05.878 align:start position:0%
even those those complaints are
 
06:24:08.628 --> 06:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
addressed ma' yeah so that's kind of a
 
06:24:12.910 --> 06:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
problem for everybody for anybody um
 
06:24:15.110 --> 06:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
anybody other have any
 
06:24:18.030 --> 06:24:18.040 align:start position:0%

Penza um thank you madam chair thank you
 
06:24:23.708 --> 06:24:23.718 align:start position:0%

06:24:25.750 --> 06:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
for you to email our committee the
 
06:24:27.468 --> 06:24:27.478 align:start position:0%

06:24:32.350 --> 06:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
that would be fantastic especially those
 
06:24:34.590 --> 06:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
um those places that are still in
 
06:24:36.750 --> 06:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
operation and we would be happy to give
 
06:24:37.948 --> 06:24:37.958 align:start position:0%
that information over to the
 
06:24:39.868 --> 06:24:39.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner who's not here right now
 
06:24:42.468 --> 06:24:42.478 align:start position:0%
cuz this is where this stuff shouldn't
 
06:24:44.270 --> 06:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
be happening at all and we need to make
 
06:24:46.750 --> 06:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
sure that our farmers are you know that
 
06:24:48.628 --> 06:24:48.638 align:start position:0%
we're they already up against a lot and
 
06:24:51.670 --> 06:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
if you know we want um we want this to
 
06:24:55.548 --> 06:24:55.558 align:start position:0%
be a a productive and uh and Lively um
 
06:24:57.270 --> 06:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
that's the first two places we used I
 
06:24:59.548 --> 06:24:59.558 align:start position:0%
stopped after that I didn't want to go
 
06:25:01.628 --> 06:25:01.638 align:start position:0%
any further because Daryl does an
 
06:25:03.948 --> 06:25:03.958 align:start position:0%
excellent job so we put our farm on hold
 
06:25:06.070 --> 06:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
for a year year and a half to two years
 
06:25:09.150 --> 06:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
till they get back up and running again
 
06:25:12.270 --> 06:25:12.280 align:start position:0%
wow okay any other questions thank you
 
06:25:24.110 --> 06:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:26.948 --> 06:25:26.958 align:start position:0%
Leslie good afternoon good afternoon
 
06:25:30.628 --> 06:25:30.638 align:start position:0%
Madam chair um and commissioner uh

your name and where you're from and
 
06:25:36.390 --> 06:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
Jonathan Leslie uh from Deerfield as
 
06:25:39.190 --> 06:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
well um I operate a considerably smaller
 
06:25:42.390 --> 06:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
Farm than Mr Sor and Senator inis um we
 
06:25:46.468 --> 06:25:46.478 align:start position:0%
started in 2020 we operate we have five
 
06:25:49.150 --> 06:25:49.160 align:start position:0%
acres of pasture maybe so I'm one of the
 
06:25:51.670 --> 06:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
Farms that um the commissioner was
 
06:25:54.150 --> 06:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
talking about who does not push product
 
06:25:56.548 --> 06:25:56.558 align:start position:0%
regularly so I just got an email today
 
06:25:59.990 --> 06:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
from one of the USDA processors in state
 
06:26:02.070 --> 06:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
asking for booking for
 
06:26:05.590 --> 06:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
2026 for animals saying they opened up
 
06:26:08.110 --> 06:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
my pigs that I'd be processing at the
 
06:26:10.590 --> 06:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
time in 2026 aren't even pregnant they
 
06:26:12.750 --> 06:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
don't even look at the boore right now
 
06:26:14.468 --> 06:26:14.478 align:start position:0%
for those animals that'll get processed
 
06:26:17.150 --> 06:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
in 2026 the Lambs that I have that'll
 
06:26:20.230 --> 06:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
get processed in 2026 their moms are
 
06:26:22.708 --> 06:26:22.718 align:start position:0%
pregnant right now so I don't know how
 
06:26:24.270 --> 06:26:24.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to grow out I don't know
 
06:26:24.280 --> 06:26:25.190 align:start position:0%
they're going to grow out I don't know
where

06:26:25.190 --> 06:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:26:27.708 --> 06:26:27.718 align:start position:0%
they um you know where their weight will
 
06:26:29.510 --> 06:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
be when I want to process them I have to
 
06:26:32.590 --> 06:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
guess at okay they'll be ready in let's
 
06:26:35.510 --> 06:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
say February but if they're not I have
 
06:26:38.670 --> 06:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
to push it which you know many of our
 
06:26:41.990 --> 06:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
smaller USDA processors in state can
 
06:26:46.310 --> 06:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
accommodate to an extent but not you
 
06:26:47.948 --> 06:26:47.958 align:start position:0%
know push it a week or two weeks or
 
06:26:49.788 --> 06:26:49.798 align:start position:0%
three weeks we have to push it you know
 
06:26:52.468 --> 06:26:52.478 align:start position:0%
a couple months which then will'll
 
06:26:56.430 --> 06:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
continue spending money on Hay or feed
 
06:26:59.708 --> 06:26:59.718 align:start position:0%
and the animals will not get bigger at
 
06:27:03.310 --> 06:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
the same rate um we've been talking
 
06:27:06.548 --> 06:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
about USDA versus custom butchers I've
 
06:27:08.390 --> 06:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
had excellent experiences at USDA
 
06:27:10.910 --> 06:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
butchers I've used Daryl here at East
 
06:27:12.830 --> 06:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
from East Conway I've used Bloods down
 
06:27:14.628 --> 06:27:14.638 align:start position:0%
in groten I've also used several custom
 
06:27:16.070 --> 06:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
butchers who I've had excellent
 
06:27:19.270 --> 06:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
experiences with I've been lucky in that
 
06:27:20.948 --> 06:27:20.958 align:start position:0%
extent where I haven't seen these same
 
06:27:23.868 --> 06:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
issues um you know but we do have these
 
06:27:27.030 --> 06:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
USD processors that are selling Millions
 
06:27:29.548 --> 06:27:29.558 align:start position:0%
upon millions of tons of animal a year
 
06:27:31.390 --> 06:27:31.400 align:start position:0%
that are having problems we had Bor Bor
 
06:27:33.230 --> 06:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
head last year where 10 people died 60
 
06:27:36.430 --> 06:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
were hospitalized thousands were um you
 
06:27:39.910 --> 06:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
know sickened USA had issues on the
 
06:27:42.150 --> 06:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
books from 2022 that were saying they
 
06:27:46.070 --> 06:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
were an imminent threat to human health
 
06:27:48.150 --> 06:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
and they didn't do anything so we're
 
06:27:51.030 --> 06:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
paying for these USDA butchers and many
 
06:27:53.390 --> 06:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
times you know they're pushing things
 
06:27:55.430 --> 06:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
under the rug they're not necessarily
 
06:27:58.468 --> 06:27:58.478 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing um fsis which is
 
06:28:00.430 --> 06:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
the food safety inspection service has a
 
06:28:02.190 --> 06:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
website where they have open recalls
 
06:28:04.390 --> 06:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
there's hundreds of them um
 
06:28:06.150 --> 06:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa mentioned a few
 
06:28:07.390 --> 06:28:07.400 align:start position:0%
where there was foreign matter and all
 
06:28:10.230 --> 06:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
the meat um we're lucky that all of our
 
06:28:12.150 --> 06:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
processors are small here in state you
 
06:28:13.708 --> 06:28:13.718 align:start position:0%
know even our USDA processors they're
 
06:28:15.708 --> 06:28:15.718 align:start position:0%
small they care they're part of our
 
06:28:18.350 --> 06:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
community but USDA processing at the
 
06:28:20.510 --> 06:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
grocery store can come from Argentina
 
06:28:22.948 --> 06:28:22.958 align:start position:0%
Australia Austria Brazil Canada Chile
 
06:28:26.948 --> 06:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
China Costa Rica Croatia Denmark nambia
 
06:28:30.110 --> 06:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
New Zealand Nicaragua tons of countries
 
06:28:33.270 --> 06:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
they have USDA equivalent processing and
 
06:28:35.110 --> 06:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
country of origin required for chicken
 
06:28:37.830 --> 06:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
lamb and goat it can be labeled us meat
 
06:28:39.548 --> 06:28:39.558 align:start position:0%
if it if there's a process that changes
 
06:28:41.270 --> 06:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
the character meaning it's cooked cured
 
06:28:44.310 --> 06:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
smoked or restructured which is a roast
 
06:28:46.430 --> 06:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
cut down into staks so you could be
 
06:28:49.948 --> 06:28:49.958 align:start position:0%
eating beef from nambia Namibia excuse
 
06:28:54.310 --> 06:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
me that is restructured and labeled as a
 
06:28:54.320 --> 06:28:55.590 align:start position:0%
me that is restructured and labeled as a
US

06:28:55.590 --> 06:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
US
 
06:28:58.910 --> 06:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
meat from Market Basket or handford okay
 
06:29:01.910 --> 06:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
can you uh wrap up yes ma'am um on that
 
06:29:04.468 --> 06:29:04.478 align:start position:0%
note you know this this bill will be
 
06:29:06.510 --> 06:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
great for small farms such as myself to
 
06:29:08.948 --> 06:29:08.958 align:start position:0%
be able to get our animals to process
 
06:29:12.990 --> 06:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
the custom butchers are mainly good um
 
06:29:15.788 --> 06:29:15.798 align:start position:0%
and the risk for human sickness is
 
06:29:19.030 --> 06:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
relatively low based on comparing the
 
06:29:21.590 --> 06:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
sizes and what we get okay thank you any
 
06:29:24.190 --> 06:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
06:29:27.390 --> 06:29:27.400 align:start position:0%
committee so
 
06:29:30.990 --> 06:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
um what would be your response to uh
 
06:29:34.468 --> 06:29:34.478 align:start position:0%
some s some as we've stated we've heard
 
06:29:37.670 --> 06:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
the situation where uh some custom shops
 
06:29:40.910 --> 06:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
are really substandard yes ma'am I mean
 
06:29:42.548 --> 06:29:42.558 align:start position:0%
there's going to be unfortunately Bad
 
06:29:45.868 --> 06:29:45.878 align:start position:0%
actors in any profession um if we're
 
06:29:47.430 --> 06:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
looking at custom shops here in New
 
06:29:49.230 --> 06:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's there's going to be
 
06:29:50.510 --> 06:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
some bad actors just like there's some
 
06:29:55.150 --> 06:29:55.160 align:start position:0%
USDA Bad actors um they're small enough
 
06:29:58.230 --> 06:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
that the disease tracking and the issue
 
06:30:00.350 --> 06:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
tracking is going to be from my
 
06:30:02.910 --> 06:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
farm to a customer my farm to a
 
06:30:04.430 --> 06:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
restaurant if they have an issue they
 
06:30:06.110 --> 06:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
know where they got the meat from and we
 
06:30:07.868 --> 06:30:07.878 align:start position:0%
can trace it and figure out what animal
 
06:30:10.230 --> 06:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
it was from and deal with that
 
06:30:14.350 --> 06:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
accordingly okay thank you any questions
 
06:30:16.590 --> 06:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
that represent
 
06:30:19.190 --> 06:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
Penza um thank you madam chair obviously
 
06:30:20.948 --> 06:30:20.958 align:start position:0%
I'm fascinated by this subject because
 
06:30:23.590 --> 06:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
I'm asking all the questions
 
06:30:27.590 --> 06:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
um I would assume that because there's
 
06:30:29.788 --> 06:30:29.798 align:start position:0%
there's a vast amount of testimony
 
06:30:33.468 --> 06:30:33.478 align:start position:0%
coming from both sides here right so um
 
06:30:36.548 --> 06:30:36.558 align:start position:0%
saying that they've had you know um more
 
06:30:39.070 --> 06:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
problems with custom versus USDA and
 
06:30:40.788 --> 06:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
stuff like that but doesn't it matter
 
06:30:42.948 --> 06:30:42.958 align:start position:0%
kind of like where you are in the state
 
06:30:45.628 --> 06:30:45.638 align:start position:0%
because aren't there only
 
06:30:49.830 --> 06:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
four there are only four well uh East
 
06:30:52.590 --> 06:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
conways stood up standing up they'll be
 
06:30:54.110 --> 06:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
there'll be four soon there's three
 
06:30:54.120 --> 06:30:56.150 align:start position:0%
there'll be four soon there's three
currently

06:30:56.150 --> 06:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
currently
 
06:30:58.310 --> 06:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
there's it's fairly spread out
 
06:30:59.868 --> 06:30:59.878 align:start position:0%
throughout the state to be to be honest
 
06:31:02.230 --> 06:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's not that tight it's not all
 
06:31:04.708 --> 06:31:04.718 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire area
 
06:31:07.070 --> 06:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
so for example where where where are you
 
06:31:09.270 --> 06:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
going to versus where the previous
 
06:31:11.868 --> 06:31:11.878 align:start position:0%
testimony was I want to understand
 
06:31:14.788 --> 06:31:14.798 align:start position:0%
geographically so ideally I would go to
 
06:31:16.948 --> 06:31:16.958 align:start position:0%
the same processor as him East Conway in
 
06:31:19.868 --> 06:31:19.878 align:start position:0%
East Conway New Hampshire North a North
 
06:31:22.670 --> 06:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
ail okay um the other the other shop
 
06:31:24.590 --> 06:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
I've used is in Massachusetts it's in

06:31:48.948 --> 06:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
Conway all right oh what okay when you
 
06:31:52.548 --> 06:31:52.558 align:start position:0%

okay you we are a federal Meat
Plant

06:32:12.830 --> 06:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
Plant
 
06:32:15.590 --> 06:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm not opposing this bill but I'm
 
06:32:18.910 --> 06:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
not going for it um there's a lot of
 
06:32:20.830 --> 06:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
reasons for this I've been doing this
 
06:32:23.310 --> 06:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
for 40 years I've seen the good I've
 
06:32:25.788 --> 06:32:25.798 align:start position:0%
seen the bad I've seen the ugly on this
 
06:32:25.798 --> 06:32:27.590 align:start position:0%
seen the bad I've seen the ugly on this
whole

06:32:27.590 --> 06:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
whole
 
06:32:30.670 --> 06:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
part yes USDA
 
06:32:33.868 --> 06:32:33.878 align:start position:0%
does it brings a lot of business in what
 
06:32:35.628 --> 06:32:35.638 align:start position:0%
what happened that this lady was telling
 
06:32:38.030 --> 06:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
us about never should have happened
 
06:32:41.150 --> 06:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
these when you have an inspector there
 
06:32:43.628 --> 06:32:43.638 align:start position:0%
your inspect is there to watch the
 
06:32:45.070 --> 06:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
things that you're supposed to do and
 
06:32:48.430 --> 06:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
temperature is the big thing in in meat
 
06:32:51.708 --> 06:32:51.718 align:start position:0%
um the other things I understand these
 
06:32:53.510 --> 06:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
people want to do stuff at their at
 
06:32:56.070 --> 06:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
their place but
 
06:32:59.830 --> 06:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
there's when you when you kill an animal
 
06:33:01.628 --> 06:33:01.638 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things inside the
 
06:33:05.070 --> 06:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
animal that the government looks for
 
06:33:06.350 --> 06:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
it's something they're going to have to
 
06:33:08.868 --> 06:33:08.878 align:start position:0%
be trained to see because this is
 
06:33:11.468 --> 06:33:11.478 align:start position:0%
something that can make you really
 
06:33:14.548 --> 06:33:14.558 align:start position:0%
sick um and the mold part of it I mean
 
06:33:17.868 --> 06:33:17.878 align:start position:0%
the the state's going to have to monitor
 
06:33:19.788 --> 06:33:19.798 align:start position:0%
these people as far as their coolers
 
06:33:21.910 --> 06:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
their temperatures cuz that's where mold
 
06:33:25.670 --> 06:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
come from and when mold is on an animal
 
06:33:28.750 --> 06:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
and you're you're scraping it off it's
 
06:33:32.190 --> 06:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
like a it's like a fern that's gone by
 
06:33:34.230 --> 06:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
and it floats in the air well it goes
 
06:33:37.110 --> 06:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
all everywhere and those are things that
 
06:33:39.070 --> 06:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
temperature does
 
06:33:39.080 --> 06:33:41.788 align:start position:0%
temperature does
create

06:33:41.788 --> 06:33:41.798 align:start position:0%
create
 
06:33:44.350 --> 06:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
um like I say I've done I've done all
 
06:33:46.948 --> 06:33:46.958 align:start position:0%
this stuff I'd like to answer any of the
 
06:33:49.070 --> 06:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
questions these people were up here
 
06:33:51.990 --> 06:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
before but I couldn't but if you guys
 
06:33:53.948 --> 06:33:53.958 align:start position:0%
get any questions I'd be more than happy
 
06:33:58.388 --> 06:33:58.398 align:start position:0%
to to answer them okay represent Bixby
 
06:34:00.750 --> 06:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
Yeah you mentioned that uh when you
 
06:34:02.750 --> 06:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
Slaughter the animal and you open it up
 
06:34:04.350 --> 06:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
uh there are things that the inspector
 
06:34:06.750 --> 06:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
looks at and that that could poent
 
06:34:08.708 --> 06:34:08.718 align:start position:0%
potentially make you sick would that be
 
06:34:12.750 --> 06:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
things like the animal has some uh
 
06:34:14.628 --> 06:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
characteristics of being diseased that
 
06:34:16.868 --> 06:34:16.878 align:start position:0%
you didn't see when it was walking in
 
06:34:18.628 --> 06:34:18.638 align:start position:0%
but in fact you when you open it up and
 
06:34:20.150 --> 06:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
you see the organs you see that it's
 
06:34:23.350 --> 06:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
diseased yes exactly they check in the
 
06:34:26.190 --> 06:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
stomachs and the glands that's where you
 
06:34:29.670 --> 06:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
find a lot of it like in the neck
 
06:34:33.190 --> 06:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
um it's not it's not common but it
 
06:34:35.548 --> 06:34:35.558 align:start position:0%
happens I mean we've had to throw pigs
 
06:34:37.788 --> 06:34:37.798 align:start position:0%
away that's had things wrong with them
 
06:34:41.230 --> 06:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
and and beef too and that's the that's
 
06:34:43.310 --> 06:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
the whole thing that I worry about when
 
06:34:45.830 --> 06:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
people do it at their house that they
 
06:34:48.830 --> 06:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
may not see it you know that's that's
 
06:34:52.468 --> 06:34:52.478 align:start position:0%
the big problem follow up so um one I it
 
06:34:54.468 --> 06:34:54.478 align:start position:0%
would it would seem like since it's not
 
06:34:57.230 --> 06:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
that common it would seem like uh having
 
06:34:59.670 --> 06:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
someone who has seen an awful lot of
 
06:35:01.830 --> 06:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
animals would be able to that person
 
06:35:03.270 --> 06:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
would be able to recognize it more
 
06:35:05.510 --> 06:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
readily than someone who doesn't
 
06:35:07.230 --> 06:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
Slaughter that many
 
06:35:11.030 --> 06:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
animals that's true in a way but in like
 
06:35:13.990 --> 06:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
in when we work we take that stuff and S
 
06:35:16.310 --> 06:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
give it to the inspector he goes through
 
06:35:19.110 --> 06:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
it if he finds something wrong with it
 
06:35:22.190 --> 06:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
he has to get a vet there to check it
 
06:35:25.030 --> 06:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
and he'll say if it's good or it's bad
 
06:35:27.388 --> 06:35:27.398 align:start position:0%
now I'm not saying these people can't do
 
06:35:30.430 --> 06:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
that I'm not saying this at all but if
 
06:35:32.270 --> 06:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
they do see something
 
06:35:34.510 --> 06:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
wrong I think going to get a vet to take
 
06:35:36.590 --> 06:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
a look at it because the whole purpose
 
06:35:38.788 --> 06:35:38.798 align:start position:0%
of this whole thing is to make sure
 
06:35:42.270 --> 06:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
people are safe eating the product
 
06:35:44.670 --> 06:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
because we have a bigger problem this in
 
06:35:44.680 --> 06:35:45.750 align:start position:0%
because we have a bigger problem this in
New

06:35:45.750 --> 06:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
New
 
06:35:48.150 --> 06:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a lot bigger problem than what
 
06:35:50.750 --> 06:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about right now that you
 
06:35:53.750 --> 06:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
guys don't even hear about but I see and
 
06:35:55.110 --> 06:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
it's not just in New Hampshire it's in
 
06:35:58.750 --> 06:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
Maine it's it's everywhere now but I'd
 
06:36:00.708 --> 06:36:00.718 align:start position:0%
love to have time to talk about it but I
 
06:36:02.350 --> 06:36:02.360 align:start position:0%
think we're just going to keep with this
 
06:36:04.310 --> 06:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
here and well what problem are you
 
06:36:06.750 --> 06:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
referring to the problem
 
06:36:09.110 --> 06:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
is as you're saying you want to help the
 
06:36:13.628 --> 06:36:13.638 align:start position:0%
farmer in in New Hampshire okay I want
 
06:36:16.388 --> 06:36:16.398 align:start position:0%
to help the farmer in New Hampshire you
 
06:36:21.548 --> 06:36:21.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:24.468 --> 06:36:24.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that buy the same beef it's
 
06:36:26.670 --> 06:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
not from their house they're selling it
 
06:36:29.510 --> 06:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
at farmers markets saying it's their
 
06:36:33.868 --> 06:36:33.878 align:start position:0%
beef and it's Box Beef that comes from I
 
06:36:36.990 --> 06:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
TAA comes from Mexico there their
 
06:36:40.430 --> 06:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
processors cut this meat for them and
 
06:36:43.190 --> 06:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
has their Farm name on it when you go to
 
06:36:45.070 --> 06:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
their place and you think you're buying
 
06:36:47.548 --> 06:36:47.558 align:start position:0%
their beef you may be at some of them
 
06:36:49.548 --> 06:36:49.558 align:start position:0%
but there's some of them out there
 
06:36:51.430 --> 06:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
you're not buying the beef you're buying
 
06:36:53.190 --> 06:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
beef from me this is and I've thought
 
06:36:54.510 --> 06:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
this with the federal
 
06:36:57.868 --> 06:36:57.878 align:start position:0%
government I I do all the
 
06:37:00.388 --> 06:37:00.398 align:start position:0%
time uh representative wheeler and then
 
06:37:02.030 --> 06:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins thank you madam
 
06:37:04.030 --> 06:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
chair you're 100% right about that I've
 
06:37:05.430 --> 06:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
had Farmers tell me about that before
 
06:37:06.788 --> 06:37:06.798 align:start position:0%
and I'm just thinking to myself that's
 
06:37:09.310 --> 06:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
crazy but I'm not I'm not a farmer I've
 
06:37:11.788 --> 06:37:11.798 align:start position:0%
only ever processed a duck at a friend's
 
06:37:13.708 --> 06:37:13.718 align:start position:0%
house who's a homesteader but you had
 
06:37:15.468 --> 06:37:15.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned when you cut an animal open
 
06:37:18.388 --> 06:37:18.398 align:start position:0%
that uh mold spores will release from
 
06:37:20.350 --> 06:37:20.360 align:start position:0%
the animal I mean could you tell us more
 
06:37:22.310 --> 06:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
about that is that what you meant to say
 
06:37:24.030 --> 06:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
m spores will release from the animal if
 
06:37:26.910 --> 06:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
that no in the case of the lady that had
 
06:37:29.708 --> 06:37:29.718 align:start position:0%
the beef at a place where they kept it
 
06:37:32.310 --> 06:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
for 30 days and the mold grow no you
 
06:37:33.788 --> 06:37:33.798 align:start position:0%
don't get mold when you kill them and
 
06:37:35.628 --> 06:37:35.638 align:start position:0%
open them up you get mold when when
 
06:37:37.910 --> 06:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
there's a temperature change I see when
 
06:37:39.548 --> 06:37:39.558 align:start position:0%
you get a temperature change with all
 
06:37:41.830 --> 06:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
this stuff that's when mold will start
 
06:37:43.788 --> 06:37:43.798 align:start position:0%
once it's already opened once it's
 
06:37:45.350 --> 06:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
already opened and put in the cooler
 
06:37:47.948 --> 06:37:47.958 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah temperature is the main thing
 
06:37:49.868 --> 06:37:49.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative H Haskins thank
 
06:37:50.990 --> 06:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
you madam
 
06:37:54.270 --> 06:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
chair did I hear that has to have an
 
06:37:58.190 --> 06:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
inspector on site every time there's a
 
06:37:58.200 --> 06:38:00.070 align:start position:0%
inspector on site every time there's a
Slaughter

06:38:00.070 --> 06:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
Slaughter
 
06:38:03.708 --> 06:38:03.718 align:start position:0%
yes so cuz he's the one that checks so
 
06:38:06.628 --> 06:38:06.638 align:start position:0%
you have to schedule the slaughtering so
 
06:38:08.910 --> 06:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
that the inspector can be there we have
 
06:38:11.150 --> 06:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
it we have an inspector every day every
 
06:38:14.230 --> 06:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
day yep Monday through Friday that's
 
06:38:16.628 --> 06:38:16.638 align:start position:0%
interesting every slaughter house has to
 
06:38:20.270 --> 06:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
have a no no and the custom plants
 
06:38:22.230 --> 06:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of good custom plants out
 
06:38:25.830 --> 06:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
there but the state of New Hampshire and
 
06:38:27.310 --> 06:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
06:38:29.190 --> 06:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
government I mean the state of New
 
06:38:31.510 --> 06:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire used to send blood test out
 
06:38:33.230 --> 06:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
when I first started CU I've been doing
 
06:38:36.190 --> 06:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
the 38 years blood test you would you'd
 
06:38:37.750 --> 06:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
have to take a blood test send it into
 
06:38:40.230 --> 06:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they'd send it in and have
 
06:38:42.670 --> 06:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
it tested well I haven't seen that
 
06:38:45.670 --> 06:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
anymore and they used to have a person
 
06:38:48.110 --> 06:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
come around once a year just to make
 
06:38:49.990 --> 06:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
sure everything and the government come
 
06:38:53.388 --> 06:38:53.398 align:start position:0%
once a it's not enough no once a year is
 
06:38:56.468 --> 06:38:56.478 align:start position:0%
not enough and and there's there's
 
06:38:58.590 --> 06:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
places that can get by with all that
 
06:39:00.510 --> 06:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
because they do a good job and there are
 
06:39:03.708 --> 06:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of custom places but
 
06:39:06.150 --> 06:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
there the ones that aren't so good that
 
06:39:08.548 --> 06:39:08.558 align:start position:0%
makes the good ones look bad okay so you
 
06:39:09.510 --> 06:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
have a
 
06:39:13.190 --> 06:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
USDA you have a USDA Slaughter place yes
 
06:39:16.150 --> 06:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
okay yeah followup yeah followup did you
 
06:39:19.670 --> 06:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
have a fire did i y we just opened up
 
06:39:21.150 --> 06:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
but well we just got a federal
 
06:39:24.030 --> 06:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
inspection last week did you lose
 
06:39:25.468 --> 06:39:25.478 align:start position:0%
animals oh
 
06:39:27.788 --> 06:39:27.798 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and I had to pay for all them
 
06:39:30.590 --> 06:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
animals that we lost wow I'm sorry to
 
06:39:33.548 --> 06:39:33.558 align:start position:0%
hear that that's why all them people
 
06:39:35.868 --> 06:39:35.878 align:start position:0%
that had the problem with the mold and
 
06:39:37.750 --> 06:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
all this stuff that didn't get
 
06:39:39.110 --> 06:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursed with
 
06:39:41.510 --> 06:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
that they should get reimbursed for that
 
06:39:43.628 --> 06:39:43.638 align:start position:0%
because that wasn't their choice on this
 
06:39:45.670 --> 06:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
and this should be a followup on the
 
06:39:48.430 --> 06:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
06:39:51.868 --> 06:39:51.878 align:start position:0%
because this looks like a cover up to me
 
06:39:55.788 --> 06:39:55.798 align:start position:0%
it either looks like a cover up from the
 
06:40:00.830 --> 06:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:07.788 --> 06:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:10.030 --> 06:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair thank you so
 
06:40:13.190 --> 06:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony holy okay so I
 
06:40:14.948 --> 06:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
just I wantan to I want to backtrack
 
06:40:18.910 --> 06:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
quickly so you're saying that um that
 
06:40:20.990 --> 06:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
some of these some of the some of the
 
06:40:23.708 --> 06:40:23.718 align:start position:0%
farmers or facilities
 
06:40:26.310 --> 06:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
are going to the farmers market where
 
06:40:29.030 --> 06:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
I've purchased uh steak or pork or
 
06:40:31.190 --> 06:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
something like that and they're saying
 
06:40:34.910 --> 06:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
it's theirs and it's
 
06:40:36.948 --> 06:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
help me understand that and it's not
 
06:40:36.958 --> 06:40:38.230 align:start position:0%
help me understand that and it's not
because

06:40:38.230 --> 06:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:40:40.750 --> 06:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
whoever they're getting where are they
 
06:40:43.070 --> 06:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
getting it from then it's they call it
 
06:40:48.350 --> 06:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
Box Beef haned shop and I mean Shaws all
 
06:40:51.190 --> 06:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
they sell Box Beef in every every store
 
06:40:54.270 --> 06:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
because it comes in you buy cases of
 
06:40:56.948 --> 06:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
ribe eyes that's all you get ribe eyes
 
06:40:59.468 --> 06:40:59.478 align:start position:0%
you get cases of t-bones and pous that's
 
06:41:01.310 --> 06:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
all there is they cut them up they come
 
06:41:04.310 --> 06:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
from Canada they come from Mexico they
 
06:41:06.910 --> 06:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
come from Argentina well it got to the
 
06:41:08.830 --> 06:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
point and this is why I'm fighting for
 
06:41:11.548 --> 06:41:11.558 align:start position:0%
the small farmer here why I'm bringing
 
06:41:15.388 --> 06:41:15.398 align:start position:0%
this up because if they go to the farmis
 
06:41:20.468 --> 06:41:20.478 align:start position:0%
market with one beef say 12 riye staks
 
06:41:23.388 --> 06:41:23.398 align:start position:0%
and the guy next door's got 500 but he's
 
06:41:25.868 --> 06:41:25.878 align:start position:0%
got less beef than they
 
06:41:28.830 --> 06:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
got he's buying this box beef through
 
06:41:31.670 --> 06:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
his Federal plant and putting their
 
06:41:35.070 --> 06:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
label on it and and I've fought this
 
06:41:37.590 --> 06:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
with the government and I I did just
 
06:41:41.070 --> 06:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
last week and there's nothing they can
 
06:41:43.230 --> 06:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
do about but that should be under the
 
06:41:46.270 --> 06:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
state that that you're in your state
 
06:41:47.990 --> 06:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
they're in your state doing this and
 
06:41:49.868 --> 06:41:49.878 align:start position:0%
these are people that are they're good
 
06:41:49.878 --> 06:41:52.110 align:start position:0%
these are people that are they're good
people

06:41:52.110 --> 06:41:52.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:41:56.190 --> 06:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
but it's lying yeah represent follow up
 
06:41:58.548 --> 06:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
um my other question is about how you
 
06:42:01.270 --> 06:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
said um and maybe you can give it like a
 
06:42:05.670 --> 06:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
time frame when did you feel is if the
 
06:42:08.030 --> 06:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
um the safety precautions or controls
 
06:42:10.230 --> 06:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
that were in place have started to
 
06:42:13.350 --> 06:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
decline you talked about um you talked
 
06:42:16.590 --> 06:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
about a blood test you talked about um
 
06:42:19.548 --> 06:42:19.558 align:start position:0%
you know once a year is not enough when
 
06:42:22.708 --> 06:42:22.718 align:start position:0%
was it more and then like it started to
 
06:42:24.430 --> 06:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
decline can you give it like over a
 
06:42:27.948 --> 06:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
period of time it was probably
 
06:42:30.468 --> 06:42:30.478 align:start position:0%
the well
 
06:42:34.788 --> 06:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
been preco 20 oh wait before that oh way
 
06:42:39.628 --> 06:42:39.638 align:start position:0%
way before that yeah you're talking 25
 
06:42:42.388 --> 06:42:42.398 align:start position:0%
years ago was probably the last time
 
06:42:43.868 --> 06:42:43.878 align:start position:0%
that I'd seen a blood test through the
 
06:42:45.948 --> 06:42:45.958 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
06:42:48.150 --> 06:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I I don't know where I don't I
 
06:42:50.468 --> 06:42:50.478 align:start position:0%
don't know what happened I really I have
 
06:42:52.910 --> 06:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
no idea representative
 
06:42:55.510 --> 06:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair um and thank
 
06:42:56.948 --> 06:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
you for taking so many questions I've
 
06:42:59.628 --> 06:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
got a question that's kind of from out
 
06:43:03.388 --> 06:43:03.398 align:start position:0%
left field here um
 
06:43:05.190 --> 06:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that in a lot of ways our
 
06:43:07.468 --> 06:43:07.478 align:start position:0%
whole system is is they they call it
 
06:43:10.190 --> 06:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
just in time you know food gets to the
 
06:43:12.670 --> 06:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
grocery stores just in time and and it
 
06:43:14.548 --> 06:43:14.558 align:start position:0%
seems like if we only have like three
 
06:43:17.070 --> 06:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
USDA butchers and stuff I'm concerned
 
06:43:19.388 --> 06:43:19.398 align:start position:0%
that there may come a day where like
 
06:43:21.310 --> 06:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
something really bad happens and all of
 
06:43:23.788 --> 06:43:23.798 align:start position:0%
a sudden uh meat just can't get to the
 
06:43:25.750 --> 06:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
grocery stores or get to people's tables
 
06:43:25.760 --> 06:43:26.868 align:start position:0%
grocery stores or get to people's tables
anymore

06:43:26.868 --> 06:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
06:43:30.230 --> 06:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
because you know uh all of a sudden
 
06:43:32.388 --> 06:43:32.398 align:start position:0%
there's no gasoline in the gas stations
 
06:43:34.510 --> 06:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
or the grid has gone down or something
 
06:43:36.548 --> 06:43:36.558 align:start position:0%
bad has happened and now people are
 
06:43:39.270 --> 06:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
starving and one thing I kind of like
 
06:43:42.030 --> 06:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
about these things is it decentralizes
 
06:43:46.548 --> 06:43:46.558 align:start position:0%
this highly centralized system and you
 
06:43:48.948 --> 06:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
know I don't know I'm just I have this
 
06:43:51.590 --> 06:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
fantasy in my head that like people can
 
06:43:54.150 --> 06:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
go to like their local guy next door and
 
06:43:56.708 --> 06:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
get some fresh you know meat that's like
 
06:43:58.190 --> 06:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
never been frozen never been
 
06:43:59.868 --> 06:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
refrigerated it was slaughtered that day
 
06:44:01.910 --> 06:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
and take it home and it seemed like
 
06:44:04.230 --> 06:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
that's something you just can't do
 
06:44:06.750 --> 06:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
anymore but it used to be done back in
 
06:44:09.670 --> 06:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
the good old days and I don't know I
 
06:44:11.510 --> 06:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
just I like the idea that someday we
 
06:44:13.548 --> 06:44:13.558 align:start position:0%
could do that again where things are
 
06:44:18.910 --> 06:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
just like this um ecotopia idea you know
 
06:44:20.750 --> 06:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
and and it just seems like right now
 
06:44:22.190 --> 06:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
there's like you've got to truck your
 
06:44:25.150 --> 06:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
meat all over creation and you've got to
 
06:44:26.948 --> 06:44:26.958 align:start position:0%
pass it through centralized Bure
 
06:44:29.590 --> 06:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
bureaucratized hands and I just want
 
06:44:31.990 --> 06:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
like my neighbors's good you know beef
 
06:44:33.830 --> 06:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
right next door and I don't don't want
 
06:44:36.030 --> 06:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels to have to be transporting
 
06:44:37.548 --> 06:44:37.558 align:start position:0%
it or touching it or refrigerating or
 
06:44:39.310 --> 06:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
freezing it or and I don't want to have
 
06:44:41.948 --> 06:44:41.958 align:start position:0%
to pay some inspector $365 a day to
 
06:44:43.788 --> 06:44:43.798 align:start position:0%
stand there you know I just want to cut
 
06:44:45.948 --> 06:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
all that out and like I don't know I
 
06:44:47.788 --> 06:44:47.798 align:start position:0%
just is that are those days gone can
 
06:44:50.468 --> 06:44:50.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:52.468 --> 06:44:52.478 align:start position:0%
back well you don't have to you don't
 
06:44:55.830 --> 06:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
have to pay an inspector anyway that's
 
06:44:58.948 --> 06:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
not true if he works overtime you have
 
06:45:02.590 --> 06:45:02.600 align:start position:0%
to pay him you get 40 hours free a week
 
06:45:02.600 --> 06:45:03.548 align:start position:0%
to pay him you get 40 hours free a week
um

06:45:03.548 --> 06:45:03.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:07.548 --> 06:45:07.558 align:start position:0%
do I think it's gone yeah I do
 
06:45:11.350 --> 06:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
but the stuff you buy in the
 
06:45:15.230 --> 06:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
stores doesn't have to be frozen for 12
 
06:45:18.230 --> 06:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
weeks because they put gas in the
 
06:45:22.628 --> 06:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
bags and that keeps supposedly keeps the
 
06:45:25.230 --> 06:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
meat so you don't have to freeze it
 
06:45:28.910 --> 06:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
which I I am totally against 12 weeks
 
06:45:33.510 --> 06:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
not being frozen and I would say
 
06:45:36.670 --> 06:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
maybe four or five days if we cut a beef
 
06:45:38.670 --> 06:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
and vacuum packet I wouldn't want to
 
06:45:40.628 --> 06:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
push it any longer than that there's a
 
06:45:42.708 --> 06:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
gas you if you look it up they put a gas
 
06:45:45.350 --> 06:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
in the bag and I've always said this is
 
06:45:48.270 --> 06:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
the reason when I was a kid they didn't
 
06:45:49.990 --> 06:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
have Box Beef they had swinging beef
 
06:45:51.230 --> 06:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
they call it where they used to come
 
06:45:52.590 --> 06:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
right into the thing and you'd cut it
 
06:45:56.190 --> 06:45:56.200 align:start position:0%
and do this now it's not like that and
 
06:45:57.708 --> 06:45:57.718 align:start position:0%
I've and I've felt that's right along I
 
06:46:00.788 --> 06:46:00.798 align:start position:0%
have no scientific proof this is why we
 
06:46:02.708 --> 06:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
have problems with our children nowadays
 
06:46:05.270 --> 06:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
with with the Down syndrome and all
 
06:46:08.628 --> 06:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
these little things that kids never had
 
06:46:10.468 --> 06:46:10.478 align:start position:0%
and it has to come from
 
06:46:14.388 --> 06:46:14.398 align:start position:0%
somewhere and I've always said the meat
 
06:46:15.868 --> 06:46:15.878 align:start position:0%
I really think that's where it's coming
 
06:46:18.150 --> 06:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
from is the gas and the bags was when
 
06:46:20.388 --> 06:46:20.398 align:start position:0%
you go 12 weeks without freezing it
 
06:46:21.708 --> 06:46:21.718 align:start position:0%
there's a problem
 
06:46:25.350 --> 06:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
here any other questions Representatives
 
06:46:27.868 --> 06:46:27.878 align:start position:0%

Hampton New Hampshire my husband and I
 
06:47:15.350 --> 06:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
are first generation farmers in New
 
06:47:17.990 --> 06:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hampton we raise sheep beef and poultry
 
06:47:19.868 --> 06:47:19.878 align:start position:0%
on our farm and sell Meats directly to
 
06:47:19.878 --> 06:47:20.590 align:start position:0%
on our farm and sell Meats directly to
our

06:47:20.590 --> 06:47:20.600 align:start position:0%
our
 
06:47:23.190 --> 06:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
consumers as of now we sell retail cuts
 
06:47:25.310 --> 06:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
from our farm stand the beef and lamb
 
06:47:28.030 --> 06:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
has to be USD inspected to be sold by
 
06:47:30.110 --> 06:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
individual cuts to our consumers however
 
06:47:31.670 --> 06:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
the chickens and turkeys we raise are
 
06:47:33.830 --> 06:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
butchered and processed on our Farm or
 
06:47:36.230 --> 06:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
at a custom meat shop that is not USDA
 
06:47:38.628 --> 06:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
inspected or
 
06:47:41.310 --> 06:47:41.320 align:start position:0%
approved if House Bill 396 were to
 
06:47:43.030 --> 06:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
become a law it would greatly benefit
 
06:47:45.310 --> 06:47:45.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's farmers and consumers as
 
06:47:47.590 --> 06:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
of now there are only two USDA inspected
 
06:47:49.150 --> 06:47:49.160 align:start position:0%
slaughter houses in New Hampshire that
 
06:47:51.750 --> 06:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
process lamb and goats I have to
 
06:47:53.270 --> 06:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
schedule butcher dates for an unknown
 
06:47:54.830 --> 06:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
amount of animals before the animals are
 
06:47:56.510 --> 06:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
even conceived because the weight lists
 
06:47:57.590 --> 06:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
are so
 
06:48:01.030 --> 06:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
long House Bill 396 has the opportunity
 
06:48:03.230 --> 06:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
to increase commerce between farmers
 
06:48:05.830 --> 06:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
skilled custom Meat Shops and consumers
 
06:48:07.150 --> 06:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
it would allow restaurants to support
 
06:48:08.670 --> 06:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
our state's Farm businesses without
 
06:48:10.190 --> 06:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
having to import Meats from other states
 
06:48:13.070 --> 06:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
or countries food safety is extremely
 
06:48:14.750 --> 06:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
important to me as both a consumer and a
 
06:48:16.830 --> 06:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
producer is critical for butchers and
 
06:48:18.628 --> 06:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
meat processors to maintain a high level
 
06:48:20.910 --> 06:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
of Sanitation and food safety regardless
 
06:48:23.310 --> 06:48:23.320 align:start position:0%
of if the meat has a USDA label on it or
 
06:48:25.548 --> 06:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
not I would love for us to find a way to
 
06:48:27.510 --> 06:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
get safe locally grown and processed me
 
06:48:29.868 --> 06:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
into the hands of more consumers even if
 
06:48:31.230 --> 06:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
farmers were allowed to legally sell
 
06:48:33.230 --> 06:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
retail cuts from USDA approved
 
06:48:34.270 --> 06:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
facilities which are different than
 
06:48:36.190 --> 06:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
inspected in the state it would greatly
 
06:48:37.910 --> 06:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
benefit the farmers and maintain food
 
06:48:40.708 --> 06:48:40.718 align:start position:0%

06:49:23.990 --> 06:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
with a diversified livestock farmer in
 
06:49:26.708 --> 06:49:26.718 align:start position:0%
Coos County part of my farm includes a
 
06:49:28.310 --> 06:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire licensed processing
 
06:49:30.590 --> 06:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
facility in which I can process USDA
 
06:49:32.150 --> 06:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
slaughtered animals and sell as
 
06:49:34.830 --> 06:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
individual cuts to the end user I have a
 
06:49:36.468 --> 06:49:36.478 align:start position:0%

06:49:36.478 --> 06:49:37.868 align:start position:0%

Human

06:49:37.868 --> 06:49:37.878 align:start position:0%
Human
 
06:49:41.788 --> 06:49:41.798 align:start position:0%
Service I am very excited about today
 
06:49:44.510 --> 06:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
this discussion I've been talking about
 
06:49:48.510 --> 06:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
this for years that we need to do
 
06:49:48.520 --> 06:49:50.548 align:start position:0%
this for years that we need to do
something

06:49:50.548 --> 06:49:50.558 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:49:53.030 --> 06:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
but first I'd like to thank this
 
06:49:54.628 --> 06:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
committee for allowing me to testify
 
06:49:56.388 --> 06:49:56.398 align:start position:0%
today I'd also like to thank the
 
06:49:58.190 --> 06:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill for tackling the
 
06:50:00.948 --> 06:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
subject that need we need changes and
 
06:50:03.310 --> 06:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
not just for our Farmers for but for our
 
06:50:06.190 --> 06:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:08.990 --> 06:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
well as much as I'd like to see New
 
06:50:10.510 --> 06:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law that allows more freedom
 
06:50:12.310 --> 06:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
within the meat industry we need to
 
06:50:16.270 --> 06:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
remember that the USDA has the final say
 
06:50:18.868 --> 06:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
with that said just last month I was the
 
06:50:20.628 --> 06:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire delegate at the American
 
06:50:22.788 --> 06:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
Farm Bureau federation's annual
 
06:50:25.150 --> 06:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
convention during the delegate session
 
06:50:27.150 --> 06:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
we passed three different policies
 
06:50:29.788 --> 06:50:29.798 align:start position:0%
dealing with this subject one policy was
 
06:50:32.628 --> 06:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
very much like this bill a USDA EX
 
06:50:34.230 --> 06:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
extion from meat processed and sold
 
06:50:36.628 --> 06:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
within the state to the end user the
 
06:50:38.948 --> 06:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
second policy was about allowing a third
 
06:50:41.350 --> 06:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
party inspector on the kill floor while
 
06:50:43.030 --> 06:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
the third policy was directing the
 
06:50:45.750 --> 06:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
American Farm Bureau Federation board of
 
06:50:47.388 --> 06:50:47.398 align:start position:0%
directors to set up a committee that
 
06:50:49.708 --> 06:50:49.718 align:start position:0%
will start working on issues that hinder
 
06:50:51.750 --> 06:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
the small processing facilities across
 
06:50:53.830 --> 06:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
the country and this is not just in New
 
06:50:56.110 --> 06:50:56.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is not just a New England
 
06:50:58.110 --> 06:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
I've heard the Farm Bureau presidents
 
06:51:00.230 --> 06:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
from all across the country this is a
 
06:51:03.030 --> 06:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
problem across the country
 
06:51:04.708 --> 06:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
I also just recently worked with the New
 
06:51:06.070 --> 06:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Food Alliance to help them
 
06:51:07.990 --> 06:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
Write a brief for the meat and poultry
 
06:51:10.030 --> 06:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
section of the New Hampshire food and
 
06:51:12.868 --> 06:51:12.878 align:start position:0%
agriculture strategic plan this brief
 
06:51:15.030 --> 06:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
also mentions exploring the feasibility
 
06:51:18.468 --> 06:51:18.478 align:start position:0%
of a USDA approved hybrid program with a
 
06:51:18.478 --> 06:51:19.510 align:start position:0%
of a USDA approved hybrid program with a
new

06:51:19.510 --> 06:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
new
 
06:51:21.750 --> 06:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
Administration with them talking about
 
06:51:24.110 --> 06:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
the importance of the farmer with the
 
06:51:27.150 --> 06:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
make America healthy again movement and
 
06:51:30.070 --> 06:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
afbf new policies I believe that this
 
06:51:32.190 --> 06:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
committee should change this bill into a
 
06:51:35.430 --> 06:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
resol solution for the USDA and the US
 
06:51:38.310 --> 06:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
Congress this is the time for us to move
 
06:51:40.948 --> 06:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
forward and make something happen but
 
06:51:43.310 --> 06:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
please don't put the farmer and the
 
06:51:46.590 --> 06:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
processor at risk of violation with the
 
06:51:50.070 --> 06:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
USDA I think the USDA is ready I think
 
06:51:53.190 --> 06:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
covid changed things you now have some
 
06:51:55.388 --> 06:51:55.398 align:start position:0%
states with a state inspection they're
 
06:51:57.750 --> 06:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to cross state lines because of
 
06:52:01.750 --> 06:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
a program since Co Now's the Time but
 
06:52:03.150 --> 06:52:03.160 align:start position:0%
let's do it right
 
06:52:05.990 --> 06:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
right I'm going to stop
 
06:52:09.350 --> 06:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
there okay thank you questions from Miss
 
06:52:11.868 --> 06:52:11.878 align:start position:0%
Brady uh representative wheeler you had
 
06:52:13.948 --> 06:52:13.958 align:start position:0%
your hand and then representative
 
06:52:16.190 --> 06:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
Bixby thank you very much for coming and
 
06:52:17.750 --> 06:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
testifying before the
 
06:52:21.750 --> 06:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
committee could you just tell us would a
 
06:52:23.788 --> 06:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
resolution be would a resolution
 
06:52:25.948 --> 06:52:25.958 align:start position:0%
genuinely be better than just moving to
 
06:52:27.830 --> 06:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
itl this bill or doing something other
 
06:52:30.670 --> 06:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
than that I mean yes so I feel that a
 
06:52:33.910 --> 06:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
resolution to the USDA in the Congress
 
06:52:36.548 --> 06:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
would be forceful along with all these
 
06:52:38.910 --> 06:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
other things with afbf coming in at them
 
06:52:41.510 --> 06:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
with you guys coming at them I think we
 
06:52:43.388 --> 06:52:43.398 align:start position:0%
could change some minds and get some
 
06:52:45.948 --> 06:52:45.958 align:start position:0%
real reform to help everyone across the
 
06:52:49.190 --> 06:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
country it's not just us um and then you
 
06:52:52.788 --> 06:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
don't have um Farmers or custom
 
06:52:55.548 --> 06:52:55.558 align:start position:0%
processors having the feds show up and
 
06:52:55.558 --> 06:52:56.750 align:start position:0%
processors having the feds show up and
paying

06:52:56.750 --> 06:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
paying
 
06:53:00.270 --> 06:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
fines thank you represent Bixby yes so
 
06:53:03.270 --> 06:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
um Senator inis mentioned a um a sort of
 
06:53:05.910 --> 06:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
roving inspector program
 
06:53:09.708 --> 06:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
where uh a custom shop can have a u an
 
06:53:12.788 --> 06:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
inspector intermediately uh in in no not
 
06:53:15.670 --> 06:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
not intermediately like once in a while
 
06:53:19.070 --> 06:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
um intermittently intermittently yes um
 
06:53:22.270 --> 06:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
it's been a long day yeah so um we only
 
06:53:23.910 --> 06:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
have two more cards is that something
 
06:53:26.670 --> 06:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
you've ever uh availed yourself of or or
 
06:53:28.948 --> 06:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
would consider so you have to be USDA
 
06:53:31.868 --> 06:53:31.878 align:start position:0%
inspected for that USDA inspector okay
 
06:53:34.948 --> 06:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
okay so the so you said said okay so
 
06:53:37.510 --> 06:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
you're you you are you USDA inspected
 
06:53:39.510 --> 06:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
for processing but not for Slaughter no
 
06:53:42.070 --> 06:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
I am not I am State of New Hampshire
 
06:53:44.548 --> 06:53:44.558 align:start position:0%
inspected my processing facility is
 
06:53:46.548 --> 06:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
inspected under the Department of Health
 
06:53:49.350 --> 06:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
and Human Services so I have to take my
 
06:53:52.430 --> 06:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
animal to a USDA Slaughter or the state
 
06:53:54.708 --> 06:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
the one I use is actually a state
 
06:53:57.030 --> 06:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
inspected but they've got the USDA
 
06:53:59.468 --> 06:53:59.478 align:start position:0%
approval to cross state lines I bring
 
06:54:02.388 --> 06:54:02.398 align:start position:0%
the carcass back to my place hang it and
 
06:54:04.750 --> 06:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
and then cut it up and I can sell it to
 
06:54:07.110 --> 06:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
individual Cuts because I've been Pro
 
06:54:10.468 --> 06:54:10.478 align:start position:0%
the the kill has been done under USDA
 
06:54:12.468 --> 06:54:12.478 align:start position:0%
and then my processing facility has been
 
06:54:15.030 --> 06:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
inspected okay thank you so what I need
 
06:54:17.910 --> 06:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
I need to be able to kill on my
 
06:54:20.830 --> 06:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
floor yes at some point in time without
 
06:54:25.030 --> 06:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
the USDA right okay thank you so I
 
06:54:26.628 --> 06:54:26.638 align:start position:0%
thought the state didn't have an
 
06:54:29.948 --> 06:54:29.958 align:start position:0%
inspection program I am I am a state
 
06:54:32.548 --> 06:54:32.558 align:start position:0%
approved processing facility under
 
06:54:34.548 --> 06:54:34.558 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human
 
06:54:37.510 --> 06:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
Services I'm a processing facility okay
 
06:54:41.310 --> 06:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
thank you do a slight clarification uh
 
06:54:44.388 --> 06:54:44.398 align:start position:0%
so uh when um Mr clero was here last
 
06:54:46.910 --> 06:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
year uh he explained that there are
 
06:54:48.868 --> 06:54:48.878 align:start position:0%
exemptions Avail a number of exemptions
 
06:54:51.150 --> 06:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
available for the processing end of
 
06:54:54.350 --> 06:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
things and this is one of them uh what
 
06:54:55.510 --> 06:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
there where where there aren't
 
06:54:56.948 --> 06:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
exemptions at this point are in the
 
06:54:58.670 --> 06:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
slaughter are at the slaughter end
 
06:55:01.548 --> 06:55:01.558 align:start position:0%
gotcha okay thank you representative
 
06:55:04.468 --> 06:55:04.478 align:start position:0%
Gruber and then Penza thank you madam
 
06:55:07.388 --> 06:55:07.398 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you for coming um you you
 
06:55:09.750 --> 06:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh you think a resolution to
 
06:55:12.388 --> 06:55:12.398 align:start position:0%
USDA and Congress could help move in One
 
06:55:14.350 --> 06:55:14.360 align:start position:0%
Direction could you just share two or
 
06:55:15.868 --> 06:55:15.878 align:start position:0%
three the key things that should be in
 
06:55:17.788 --> 06:55:17.798 align:start position:0%
that resolution that really resonate
 
06:55:17.798 --> 06:55:18.510 align:start position:0%
that resolution that really resonate
with

06:55:18.510 --> 06:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:55:21.190 --> 06:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
you with me personally well with your
 
06:55:22.468 --> 06:55:22.478 align:start position:0%
group and the people you're working with
 
06:55:23.788 --> 06:55:23.798 align:start position:0%
what the key things you think should be
 
06:55:25.990 --> 06:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
so one of the things is allowing a third
 
06:55:29.230 --> 06:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
party inspector on the kill floor um
 
06:55:32.628 --> 06:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
back oh boy about 18 20 years ago Dr
 
06:55:35.388 --> 06:55:35.398 align:start position:0%
Crawford tried to put together a plan
 
06:55:37.750 --> 06:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
for the USDA to approve and they would
 
06:55:39.670 --> 06:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
not approve a third party inspector they
 
06:55:41.270 --> 06:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
said it had to be either a state
 
06:55:43.990 --> 06:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
employee or a federal employee if we
 
06:55:47.708 --> 06:55:47.718 align:start position:0%
could get a a a third party inspector
 
06:55:51.110 --> 06:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
such as a vet a vet tech someone that's
 
06:55:54.110 --> 06:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
gone through some type of program um
 
06:55:56.350 --> 06:55:56.360 align:start position:0%
that would help alleviate the whole
 
06:55:59.110 --> 06:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
inspector problem any that that would be
 
06:56:01.030 --> 06:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
a game changer for me uh any other
 
06:56:02.910 --> 06:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
issues just one any other key issues you
 
06:56:05.788 --> 06:56:05.798 align:start position:0%
want that resolution to include
 
06:56:09.548 --> 06:56:09.558 align:start position:0%
um I think Rob Johnson has written
 
06:56:11.830 --> 06:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
something up
 
06:56:11.840 --> 06:56:13.708 align:start position:0%
something up
um

06:56:13.708 --> 06:56:13.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:56:15.708 --> 06:56:15.718 align:start position:0%
so I
 
06:56:19.190 --> 06:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
think there's been a lot said here
 
06:56:22.468 --> 06:56:22.478 align:start position:0%
today um but I know that he he has got
 
06:56:24.430 --> 06:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
some writing and we can get that to you
 
06:56:27.190 --> 06:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you represent Penza and
 
06:56:30.788 --> 06:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
then representative Bixby is that
 
06:56:33.030 --> 06:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you thank you madam chair
 
06:56:36.310 --> 06:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so you
 
06:56:38.430 --> 06:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
would have to just so I understand you
 
06:56:40.388 --> 06:56:40.398 align:start position:0%
have to bring the animals someplace to
 
06:56:42.150 --> 06:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
get slaughtered and then you bring it
 
06:56:45.030 --> 06:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
back and that okay
 
06:56:48.480 --> 06:56:48.490 align:start position:0%
um do you believe that there is
 
06:56:48.490 --> 06:56:49.750 align:start position:0%
um do you believe that there is
[Music]

06:56:49.750 --> 06:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:56:54.310 --> 06:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
um enough um skilled people or there
 
06:56:57.230 --> 06:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
that there could be to um whether they
 
06:56:59.830 --> 06:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
are private it doesn't you know USDA not
 
06:57:02.150 --> 06:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
USDA State trained employee whatever
 
06:57:04.230 --> 06:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
ever it may be but if these people are
 
06:57:08.948 --> 06:57:08.958 align:start position:0%
all um have been trained certified um
 
06:57:11.070 --> 06:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
capable that we would be able to do
 
06:57:13.468 --> 06:57:13.478 align:start position:0%
something without all of the level of
 
06:57:16.070 --> 06:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy if I mean could we be able
 
06:57:19.388 --> 06:57:19.398 align:start position:0%
to run uh efficient operations like this
 
06:57:22.350 --> 06:57:22.360 align:start position:0%
and um and have have multitudes of
 
06:57:24.510 --> 06:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
people that are that are trained and
 
06:57:27.150 --> 06:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
efficient is there a is you know is
 
06:57:30.190 --> 06:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
there enough of a population you know we
 
06:57:33.070 --> 06:57:33.080 align:start position:0%
always have a lack of let's say the HVAC
 
06:57:35.030 --> 06:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
industry or we have a lack of this is
 
06:57:37.910 --> 06:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
there would we would we have if we open
 
06:57:40.628 --> 06:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
that up like if it just happened where
 
06:57:42.788 --> 06:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
would we be at with amount of people
 
06:57:45.150 --> 06:57:45.160 align:start position:0%
that would actually know what to do to
 
06:57:47.510 --> 06:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
be able to make this happen for New
 
06:57:50.548 --> 06:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where would the uptick be the
 
06:57:53.388 --> 06:57:53.398 align:start position:0%
uptick would be in the small the very
 
06:57:58.270 --> 06:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
small person so right in my area up in
 
06:58:02.548 --> 06:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
Coos County I can think of four custom
 
06:58:06.670 --> 06:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
places and they're all mostly a one meat
 
06:58:09.788 --> 06:58:09.798 align:start position:0%
cutter maybe two but if that gave the
 
06:58:11.868 --> 06:58:11.878 align:start position:0%
farmer the ability to sell individual
 
06:58:15.310 --> 06:58:15.320 align:start position:0%
Cuts you've opened up a whole new market
 
06:58:18.548 --> 06:58:18.558 align:start position:0%
Without Really adding any skill to the
 
06:58:22.628 --> 06:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:25.030 --> 06:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
markets follow up but wouldn't those
 
06:58:27.788 --> 06:58:27.798 align:start position:0%
folks that let's say those four Customs
 
06:58:29.590 --> 06:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
they would have to still go through
 
06:58:31.708 --> 06:58:31.718 align:start position:0%
something some sort of certification
 
06:58:31.718 --> 06:58:33.310 align:start position:0%
something some sort of certification
train

06:58:33.310 --> 06:58:33.320 align:start position:0%
train
 
06:58:34.468 --> 06:58:34.478 align:start position:0%
and that they would have just like
 
06:58:36.230 --> 06:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
anybody else like they would have to
 
06:58:38.868 --> 06:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
probably maybe every single make sure
 
06:58:41.350 --> 06:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
that you know um that their training
 
06:58:43.350 --> 06:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
their knowledge if there's anything
 
06:58:44.910 --> 06:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
that's up to date or whatever that they
 
06:58:46.990 --> 06:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
would you know keep their licensing or
 
06:58:49.788 --> 06:58:49.798 align:start position:0%
whatever or seal of approval from state
 
06:58:51.990 --> 06:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
or federal government so do you think
 
06:58:56.430 --> 06:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
that um those four custom P people for
 
06:58:58.468 --> 06:58:58.478 align:start position:0%
example would jump at the chance to do
 
06:59:01.708 --> 06:59:01.718 align:start position:0%
that to be able to open up um that for
 
06:59:04.230 --> 06:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
all different small places and shops in
 
06:59:06.310 --> 06:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think so I think if it's
 
06:59:09.670 --> 06:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
not too much of a burden um financial
 
06:59:12.270 --> 06:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
and time consuming burden I think we all
 
06:59:14.510 --> 06:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
want the best for the end end user the
 
06:59:16.270 --> 06:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
the customer we all want them eating
 
06:59:17.868 --> 06:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
locally because if they're eating
 
06:59:19.548 --> 06:59:19.558 align:start position:0%
locally that means they're buying from
 
06:59:21.388 --> 06:59:21.398 align:start position:0%
our Farmers that we're processing their
 
06:59:21.398 --> 06:59:22.510 align:start position:0%
our Farmers that we're processing their
animals

06:59:22.510 --> 06:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
animals
 
06:59:26.070 --> 06:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
for okay represent Biby oh I'm sorry but
 
06:59:28.468 --> 06:59:28.478 align:start position:0%
as far as if we were to open up a big
 
06:59:30.990 --> 06:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
facility another USDA facility that
 
06:59:33.190 --> 06:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of people do I I think it's
 
06:59:36.830 --> 06:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
about helping the small the small person
 
06:59:40.388 --> 06:59:40.398 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so um would you or Rob
 
06:59:43.150 --> 06:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
Johnson be able to uh provide us with
 
06:59:45.910 --> 06:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
some suggested text for a resolution
 
06:59:47.468 --> 06:59:47.478 align:start position:0%
because I don't think we I don't think
 
06:59:49.350 --> 06:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
we want to try to like word Smith it
 
06:59:51.830 --> 06:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
right now no no and he's he has got some
 
06:59:54.468 --> 06:59:54.478 align:start position:0%
stuff okay already to give to you okay
 
06:59:57.548 --> 06:59:57.558 align:start position:0%
great but I guess what I for personally
 
07:00:00.310 --> 07:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
right now my only hindrance is the kill
 
07:00:02.670 --> 07:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
floor because I've got
 
07:00:05.430 --> 07:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
we have another Avenue of processing
 
07:00:08.030 --> 07:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
it's through the DHHS so our big
 
07:00:10.628 --> 07:00:10.638 align:start position:0%
hindrance is the is the kill floor right
 
07:00:14.150 --> 07:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you okay appreciate your
 
07:00:15.830 --> 07:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
time this
 
07:00:28.270 --> 07:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:31.070 --> 07:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
forite uh good afternoon Madam chair
 
07:00:33.788 --> 07:00:33.798 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is Kyle fory I
 
07:00:35.868 --> 07:00:35.878 align:start position:0%
own and operate a farm in Guilford New
 
07:00:39.030 --> 07:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with my wife Amy uh we mainly
 
07:00:41.948 --> 07:00:41.958 align:start position:0%
raise a grassfed beef and lamb pastured
 
07:00:44.190 --> 07:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
pork turkey and chicken uh we're very
 
07:00:46.190 --> 07:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
familiar with using uh processing
 
07:00:47.628 --> 07:00:47.638 align:start position:0%
facilities in the state and have for
 
07:00:47.638 --> 07:00:48.468 align:start position:0%
facilities in the state and have for
several

07:00:48.468 --> 07:00:48.478 align:start position:0%
several
 
07:00:51.310 --> 07:00:51.320 align:start position:0%
years uh a lot of the things that I was
 
07:00:52.590 --> 07:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
going to mention today have already been
 
07:00:54.150 --> 07:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned and I don't want to like
 
07:00:56.548 --> 07:00:56.558 align:start position:0%
reiterate it facing a lot of the similar
 
07:00:59.030 --> 07:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
issues of having to make dates too far
 
07:01:02.430 --> 07:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
in advance um you know just the
 
07:01:04.270 --> 07:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
turnaround time tends to be stretched
 
07:01:06.670 --> 07:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
out as a smaller Farm it's harder for us
 
07:01:08.510 --> 07:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
to have like consistent processing dates
 
07:01:10.628 --> 07:01:10.638 align:start position:0%
throughout the year it's also relative
 
07:01:13.590 --> 07:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
to we're in the Northeast and a lot of
 
07:01:16.030 --> 07:01:16.040 align:start position:0%
it's seasonal you know it's like if I
 
07:01:18.310 --> 07:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
raise a lamb it doesn't make sense for
 
07:01:20.468 --> 07:01:20.478 align:start position:0%
me to keep it all winter it's not going
 
07:01:23.190 --> 07:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
to get much bigger you know and so even
 
07:01:24.388 --> 07:01:24.398 align:start position:0%
though it would be easier for me to get
 
07:01:27.830 --> 07:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
a processing date in the spring that
 
07:01:29.230 --> 07:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that that makes sense for
 
07:01:32.190 --> 07:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
us in the bottom line and so I I think
 
07:01:33.788 --> 07:01:33.798 align:start position:0%
part of what this bill is trying to
 
07:01:35.628 --> 07:01:35.638 align:start position:0%
accomplish is giving the opportunity to
 
07:01:38.350 --> 07:01:38.360 align:start position:0%
open up the market to these smaller
 
07:01:41.150 --> 07:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
facilities and I think a key Point
 
07:01:43.388 --> 07:01:43.398 align:start position:0%
really just after hearing everybody
 
07:01:45.750 --> 07:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
speak is
 
07:01:48.788 --> 07:01:48.798 align:start position:0%
that I think people come to to a farmer
 
07:01:51.150 --> 07:01:51.160 align:start position:0%
like me because they know me and they
 
07:01:53.708 --> 07:01:53.718 align:start position:0%
trust me and I think that's the whole
 
07:01:57.388 --> 07:01:57.398 align:start position:0%
concept behind it it's about getting
 
07:02:00.110 --> 07:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
the bureaucracy out of it and giving
 
07:02:01.310 --> 07:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
people the opportunity to make the
 
07:02:03.230 --> 07:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
choice themselves
 
07:02:05.110 --> 07:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
as opposed to feeling like we have to
 
07:02:06.868 --> 07:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
have this whole huge system in order to
 
07:02:08.110 --> 07:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
protect them because they don't know
 
07:02:10.708 --> 07:02:10.718 align:start position:0%
what they're doing I think people have
 
07:02:13.868 --> 07:02:13.878 align:start position:0%
gravitated away from that and why it's
 
07:02:17.190 --> 07:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
why they've there's been a huge uptick
 
07:02:18.990 --> 07:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
especially after Co and the supply chain
 
07:02:21.468 --> 07:02:21.478 align:start position:0%
issues I mean it was unbelievable the
 
07:02:23.270 --> 07:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
change that happened and that hasn't
 
07:02:27.230 --> 07:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
gone away um and I think it's only going
 
07:02:28.990 --> 07:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
to get bigger and I think the problem is
 
07:02:30.708 --> 07:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
there's just no room to
 
07:02:34.708 --> 07:02:34.718 align:start position:0%
grow um um it's very difficult within
 
07:02:36.110 --> 07:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
the current
 
07:02:38.510 --> 07:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
system to think about
 
07:02:42.030 --> 07:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
expanding and for me personally I think
 
07:02:43.868 --> 07:02:43.878 align:start position:0%
I would love the ability to be able to
 
07:02:46.350 --> 07:02:46.360 align:start position:0%
bring processing onto the farm you're
 
07:02:49.110 --> 07:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
eliminating the trucking of the animals
 
07:02:51.670 --> 07:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
which is significant it's also there's
 
07:02:54.070 --> 07:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
all kinds of added losses to that like
 
07:02:56.230 --> 07:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
the animals physically lose weight
 
07:02:58.750 --> 07:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
during traveling it's pretty stressful
 
07:03:02.230 --> 07:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
on them and you know I mean it's like we
 
07:03:03.708 --> 07:03:03.718 align:start position:0%
raise these animals and they're almost
 
07:03:05.830 --> 07:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
like pets you know it's like you have a
 
07:03:07.548 --> 07:03:07.558 align:start position:0%
personal relationship with them and
 
07:03:09.788 --> 07:03:09.798 align:start position:0%
that's what people appreciate is that
 
07:03:11.548 --> 07:03:11.558 align:start position:0%
there's this Dynamic of knowing where
 
07:03:14.150 --> 07:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
your food comes from and then so there's
 
07:03:15.868 --> 07:03:15.878 align:start position:0%
a bit of a disconnect with the current
 
07:03:17.510 --> 07:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
system and the way that we then do the
 
07:03:19.548 --> 07:03:19.558 align:start position:0%
processing they're going to some far
 
07:03:22.310 --> 07:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
away land you know they don't understand
 
07:03:24.590 --> 07:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
what's going on and I've been on farms
 
07:03:26.948 --> 07:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
before where we've processed animals
 
07:03:29.030 --> 07:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
just for own personal consumption and
 
07:03:30.788 --> 07:03:30.798 align:start position:0%
it's a totally different experience for
 
07:03:32.750 --> 07:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
the animal itself
 
07:03:35.190 --> 07:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
than going through the whole process uh
 
07:03:36.708 --> 07:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
that we have to do
 
07:03:39.548 --> 07:03:39.558 align:start position:0%
now and so I don't know that the way
 
07:03:42.430 --> 07:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
that this bill is written is fully how
 
07:03:43.948 --> 07:03:43.958 align:start position:0%
it should be I see a lot of the
 
07:03:45.548 --> 07:03:45.558 align:start position:0%
arguments being made and they're good
 
07:03:48.750 --> 07:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
ones but I do think that there's no
 
07:03:51.350 --> 07:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
doubt that there's a huge issue here
 
07:03:54.548 --> 07:03:54.558 align:start position:0%
okay can you conclude please um yeah I
 
07:03:57.750 --> 07:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
think mainly I'm definitely into the
 
07:04:00.990 --> 07:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
idea of trying to get involved uh with
 
07:04:02.830 --> 07:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
our state to help get the prime act
 
07:04:05.590 --> 07:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
approved on the federal level um they've
 
07:04:07.868 --> 07:04:07.878 align:start position:0%
been trying to put it through for eight
 
07:04:10.788 --> 07:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
years every year they put it in it never
 
07:04:13.590 --> 07:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
gets out of committee so um maybe we
 
07:04:16.510 --> 07:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
need to send some uh lobbies or
 
07:04:19.670 --> 07:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
something I don't know okay yeah I'm
 
07:04:21.788 --> 07:04:21.798 align:start position:0%
good thank you thank you any questions
 
07:04:21.798 --> 07:04:22.910 align:start position:0%
good thank you thank you any questions
representative

07:04:22.910 --> 07:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:04:25.430 --> 07:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
07:04:26.230 --> 07:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
for your
 
07:04:28.190 --> 07:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
testimony you're talking about how it
 
07:04:30.948 --> 07:04:30.958 align:start position:0%
would be nice if Farmers could process
 
07:04:33.590 --> 07:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
the meat on their own farm and sell it
 
07:04:36.150 --> 07:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
um and that sounds cool but historically
 
07:04:37.708 --> 07:04:37.718 align:start position:0%
I could be wrong here but historically
 
07:04:40.990 --> 07:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
it seems like uh back in the day Farmers
 
07:04:43.830 --> 07:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
would take their pig or their cow I mean
 
07:04:45.070 --> 07:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't even put them in a truck
 
07:04:46.670 --> 07:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
they would literally walk it to the
 
07:04:49.190 --> 07:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
local butcher and the butcher would
 
07:04:51.548 --> 07:04:51.558 align:start position:0%
Slaughter it and I think the butcher
 
07:04:53.830 --> 07:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
would sell the meat too the farmer
 
07:04:55.350 --> 07:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't really interested in getting the
 
07:04:57.468 --> 07:04:57.478 align:start position:0%
meat back and then taking it home and
 
07:05:00.388 --> 07:05:00.398 align:start position:0%
then trying to be the salesperson to me
 
07:05:02.468 --> 07:05:02.478 align:start position:0%
it seems a little bit like
 
07:05:04.868 --> 07:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
the idea of the farmer also being the
 
07:05:07.430 --> 07:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
salesperson for the meat is sort of like
 
07:05:10.350 --> 07:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
a it's like a response to something
 
07:05:12.670 --> 07:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
that's blocking that original process
 
07:05:15.310 --> 07:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
that historical process from happening
 
07:05:17.510 --> 07:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
what is blocking that historical process
 
07:05:19.750 --> 07:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
from happening where people could just
 
07:05:22.270 --> 07:05:22.280 align:start position:0%
literally walk their their their meat to
 
07:05:24.150 --> 07:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
the butcher the butcher would butcher it
 
07:05:26.310 --> 07:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
and then sell it locally why why doesn't
 
07:05:27.548 --> 07:05:27.558 align:start position:0%
that happen
 
07:05:30.990 --> 07:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
anymore well I think you know I mean our
 
07:05:32.310 --> 07:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
entire Market Market structure is
 
07:05:33.750 --> 07:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
completely different and everybody's
 
07:05:35.948 --> 07:05:35.958 align:start position:0%
used to going to the grocery store uh
 
07:05:38.590 --> 07:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
there's a huge convenience element to it
 
07:05:39.990 --> 07:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that we've started
 
07:05:41.750 --> 07:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
doing is an online Farm Store where
 
07:05:43.388 --> 07:05:43.398 align:start position:0%
people can order online and then get it
 
07:05:45.070 --> 07:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
delivered to their house and that's
 
07:05:47.468 --> 07:05:47.478 align:start position:0%
helped a lot um I think it's just people
 
07:05:49.430 --> 07:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
are used to you know they're not going
 
07:05:52.350 --> 07:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
to a butcher shop and to the produce
 
07:05:54.670 --> 07:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
shop and it's all in one spot and so
 
07:05:58.030 --> 07:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
we're competing against that um I think
 
07:05:59.590 --> 07:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
also it's just the distance you know
 
07:06:01.190 --> 07:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
there just isn't enough facilities and I
 
07:06:02.708 --> 07:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
think that's part of what this bill is
 
07:06:05.510 --> 07:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
trying to address because the custom
 
07:06:07.910 --> 07:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
shops are everywhere like there's dozens
 
07:06:09.590 --> 07:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
of them I have one right up the street
 
07:06:12.468 --> 07:06:12.478 align:start position:0%
for me and you know some of them may be
 
07:06:14.468 --> 07:06:14.478 align:start position:0%
good and may be bad I personally have
 
07:06:17.350 --> 07:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
not been using them because I only sell
 
07:06:20.030 --> 07:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
retail and we have to use the
 
07:06:23.590 --> 07:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
USDA um and so if but I have had
 
07:06:25.590 --> 07:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
conversations with some of the local
 
07:06:28.468 --> 07:06:28.478 align:start position:0%
custom shops who are eager and waiting
 
07:06:30.788 --> 07:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
for business from someone like me I
 
07:06:33.548 --> 07:06:33.558 align:start position:0%
think it's it's just a matter of you
 
07:06:35.070 --> 07:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
know we can't do it because we're
 
07:06:36.708 --> 07:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
selling retail cuts and that's the way
 
07:06:41.310 --> 07:06:41.320 align:start position:0%
our business model is um and I you know
 
07:06:43.868 --> 07:06:43.878 align:start position:0%
having talked with some of these uh
 
07:06:46.150 --> 07:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
processors I personally don't feel a lot
 
07:06:47.788 --> 07:06:47.798 align:start position:0%
of concern about
 
07:06:51.110 --> 07:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
safety uh interacting with them directly
 
07:06:52.910 --> 07:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
you know these facilities are not just
 
07:06:56.310 --> 07:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
like somebody's backyard they're you
 
07:06:58.110 --> 07:06:58.120 align:start position:0%
know inspected facilities they just
 
07:06:59.708 --> 07:06:59.718 align:start position:0%
don't have an inspector on site
 
07:07:01.548 --> 07:07:01.558 align:start position:0%
inspecting each animal it's really
 
07:07:03.910 --> 07:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
really the main
 
07:07:06.110 --> 07:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
difference representative
 
07:07:09.468 --> 07:07:09.478 align:start position:0%
Penza um thank you madam chair thank you
 
07:07:12.030 --> 07:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
representative uh King for that CU I was
 
07:07:14.990 --> 07:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
thinking about that too like it this the
 
07:07:16.548 --> 07:07:16.558 align:start position:0%
process is so different than what it
 
07:07:18.868 --> 07:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
used to be I mean I remember growing up
 
07:07:22.110 --> 07:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
and you'd go to the local butcher but so
 
07:07:24.230 --> 07:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
do you think that it would ever go back
 
07:07:26.750 --> 07:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
to that or is it just because there's
 
07:07:28.868 --> 07:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
not enough I mean here in conquered
 
07:07:30.910 --> 07:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
there's a local butcher but he's
 
07:07:35.030 --> 07:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
obviously not um Outback yeah you know
 
07:07:36.990 --> 07:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
slaughtering so it's just it's very
 
07:07:40.030 --> 07:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
different I think a lot of them do uh
 
07:07:42.190 --> 07:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
like most of the USDA facilities have a
 
07:07:45.628 --> 07:07:45.638 align:start position:0%
retail shop as well um okay I just think
 
07:07:47.070 --> 07:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
it's more about convenience people are
 
07:07:48.270 --> 07:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
used to going to the grocery store you
 
07:07:49.750 --> 07:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
get everything you need why are they
 
07:07:52.548 --> 07:07:52.558 align:start position:0%
going to go to a second place you know
 
07:07:56.190 --> 07:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
and they might have you know they might
 
07:07:58.070 --> 07:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate the quality better and it
 
07:08:00.670 --> 07:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
would be worth it to do it sometimes but
 
07:08:04.628 --> 07:08:04.638 align:start position:0%
maybe not for the everyday meal you know
 
07:08:08.750 --> 07:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you okay I have one last uh one
 
07:08:11.230 --> 07:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
last card thank you so much for your
 
07:08:13.190 --> 07:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
coming out today and speaking with us
 
07:08:15.590 --> 07:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
and if you have written testimony uh
 
07:08:18.270 --> 07:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
please share it with a clerk
 
07:08:20.910 --> 07:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
here uh last but not least we have
 
07:08:23.590 --> 07:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative Erica Leon uh I don't
 
07:08:25.270 --> 07:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
know if anybody else wishes to speak at
 
07:08:29.868 --> 07:08:29.878 align:start position:0%
all but this is the last pink card I
 
07:08:32.670 --> 07:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
have good afternoon good afternoon thank
 
07:08:34.270 --> 07:08:34.280 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I won't try and keep us
 
07:08:36.070 --> 07:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
to me being here eight hours straight
 
07:08:37.510 --> 07:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
because I'm sure you've been here just
 
07:08:40.190 --> 07:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
about as long uh my for the record my
 
07:08:42.670 --> 07:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
name is Erica Leon I represent Dairy
 
07:08:44.948 --> 07:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
which is Rockingham 13 and I am a
 
07:08:48.150 --> 07:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill um I have been
 
07:08:49.628 --> 07:08:49.638 align:start position:0%
lucky enough to be able to buy a half
 
07:08:52.590 --> 07:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
beef even from land that touches mine uh
 
07:08:54.350 --> 07:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
but not everybody has enough freezer
 
07:08:57.150 --> 07:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
space or is able to deal with the cost
 
07:09:00.070 --> 07:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
of getting half a beef um we recently
 
07:09:03.350 --> 07:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
purchased it and we only had a 40% yield
 
07:09:06.548 --> 07:09:06.558 align:start position:0%
coming back from a USDA facility with
 
07:09:09.830 --> 07:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
holes in the packaging so I got meat
 
07:09:11.150 --> 07:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
that had been slaughtered only a few
 
07:09:14.628 --> 07:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
days earlier and Frozen that has massive
 
07:09:18.230 --> 07:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
ice crystals within the ground beef this
 
07:09:21.590 --> 07:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
was an issue of the processing so I I I
 
07:09:23.430 --> 07:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
like my local farmer they're literally a
 
07:09:24.868 --> 07:09:24.878 align:start position:0%
neighbor I can walk across the street
 
07:09:26.910 --> 07:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
and go from my land to their land so I
 
07:09:29.310 --> 07:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
didn't ask them to eat that cost of
 
07:09:31.948 --> 07:09:31.958 align:start position:0%
having only a 40% yield off the hanging
 
07:09:35.030 --> 07:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
weight um instead of the higher 60% that
 
07:09:37.750 --> 07:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
you would expect and I didn't hold them
 
07:09:39.110 --> 07:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
accountable for the fact that there were
 
07:09:41.388 --> 07:09:41.398 align:start position:0%
holes in the packaging but it makes it a
 
07:09:43.708 --> 07:09:43.718 align:start position:0%
lot harder for me to go ahead and keep
 
07:09:45.150 --> 07:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
supporting my local
 
07:09:47.548 --> 07:09:47.558 align:start position:0%
farms I would like to see more of an
 
07:09:49.990 --> 07:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for everybody to be able to
 
07:09:53.628 --> 07:09:53.638 align:start position:0%
get happy meat grown locally by good
 
07:09:55.110 --> 07:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
Farmers where you can look in them in
 
07:09:57.468 --> 07:09:57.478 align:start position:0%
the eye shake their hand and have a
 
07:09:59.190 --> 07:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
conversation about where the meat is
 
07:10:01.310 --> 07:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
processed and how it's processed because
 
07:10:02.628 --> 07:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
because right now when it goes into the
 
07:10:04.830 --> 07:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
big USDA machine there's a lot of
 
07:10:06.830 --> 07:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions and it just doesn't
 
07:10:09.150 --> 07:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
give us the level of safety that we all
 
07:10:10.910 --> 07:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
used to think the government stamp
 
07:10:13.750 --> 07:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
provided so I really would like to see
 
07:10:16.350 --> 07:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
whatever we can do in order to increase
 
07:10:18.910 --> 07:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
the ability for Neighbors to transact
 
07:10:21.430 --> 07:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
with neighbors to eat happy beef and
 
07:10:24.830 --> 07:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
happy pigs um and be able to have good
 
07:10:27.670 --> 07:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
food raised locally and just really
 
07:10:29.868 --> 07:10:29.878 align:start position:0%
support one another um I do think that
 
07:10:32.590 --> 07:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
if you look towards a res solution I I
 
07:10:34.110 --> 07:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
think that this might be something that
 
07:10:35.750 --> 07:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
has enough interest that if you come
 
07:10:37.548 --> 07:10:37.558 align:start position:0%
together with the language we may even
 
07:10:39.388 --> 07:10:39.398 align:start position:0%
be able to suspend the rules in order to
 
07:10:41.030 --> 07:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
do a late Drafting and late introduction
 
07:10:43.230 --> 07:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
of a house resolution if we have
 
07:10:45.830 --> 07:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
language that works because I think that
 
07:10:49.070 --> 07:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
good food raised well slaughtered well
 
07:10:52.190 --> 07:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
and at prices that allow Farmers to keep
 
07:10:54.388 --> 07:10:54.398 align:start position:0%
their Farms running and allow households
 
07:10:55.830 --> 07:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
to eat that meat is something that
 
07:10:58.430 --> 07:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
everybody can agree on um so while I
 
07:11:00.270 --> 07:11:00.280 align:start position:0%
would like to move forward and try and
 
07:11:02.070 --> 07:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
see what we can do to provide whatever
 
07:11:04.270 --> 07:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
carve outs we can for New Hampshire
 
07:11:06.190 --> 07:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
consumers for New Hampshire farmers and
 
07:11:08.750 --> 07:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire processors um I I also
 
07:11:10.430 --> 07:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
would like to see us encouraging the
 
07:11:13.270 --> 07:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
federal level um got a message into the
 
07:11:15.350 --> 07:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
perennial sponsor of the Prime act so
 
07:11:16.708 --> 07:11:16.718 align:start position:0%
I'll let you know if he's coming back to
 
07:11:19.070 --> 07:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
do it again this year uh which would be
 
07:11:21.510 --> 07:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
great to have but I would just urge you
 
07:11:23.750 --> 07:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
to understand that having a government
 
07:11:25.750 --> 07:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
stamp doesn't mean that all is well
 
07:11:27.150 --> 07:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a lot more important to
 
07:11:28.510 --> 07:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
be able to look somebody in the eye
 
07:11:30.230 --> 07:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
shake their hand and really talk through
 
07:11:32.110 --> 07:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
the process as well well and be
 
07:11:34.310 --> 07:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable in the process if we bring
 
07:11:35.910 --> 07:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
more of this back inh house to New
 
07:11:37.868 --> 07:11:37.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we can have New Hampshire
 
07:11:39.868 --> 07:11:39.878 align:start position:0%
specific meet with New Hampshire
 
07:11:41.868 --> 07:11:41.878 align:start position:0%
specific inspections I think we'll have
 
07:11:44.590 --> 07:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
a lot more confidence and quite frankly
 
07:11:46.948 --> 07:11:46.958 align:start position:0%
I'd be in favor of having a law that you
 
07:11:48.548 --> 07:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
can't advertise something as New
 
07:11:50.910 --> 07:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire beef or New Hampshire pork
 
07:11:52.590 --> 07:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
unless it actually lived in New
 
07:11:55.190 --> 07:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ate in New Hampshire grew in
 
07:11:57.430 --> 07:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and has now returned to
 
07:11:59.670 --> 07:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I I recognize with I am
 
07:12:01.590 --> 07:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
wrapping it up I recognize with the
 
07:12:03.868 --> 07:12:03.878 align:start position:0%
shortage of processing facilities maybe
 
07:12:05.350 --> 07:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
we can't also say slaughtered and
 
07:12:06.750 --> 07:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
processed in New Hampshire because
 
07:12:08.310 --> 07:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
there's times when somebody needs to go
 
07:12:10.350 --> 07:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
across the border I hear there's no
 
07:12:13.910 --> 07:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
poultry USDA processors within the state
 
07:12:16.070 --> 07:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
um but let's have our New Hampshire beef
 
07:12:18.190 --> 07:12:18.200 align:start position:0%
be New Hampshire beef um so that we can
 
07:12:19.948 --> 07:12:19.958 align:start position:0%
have some good truth in
 
07:12:23.270 --> 07:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
advertising thank you representative
 
07:12:26.548 --> 07:12:26.558 align:start position:0%
King oh representative King go ahead
 
07:12:28.510 --> 07:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um thank you for
 
07:12:31.628 --> 07:12:31.638 align:start position:0%
your testimony have you ever experiened
 
07:12:34.350 --> 07:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
or known people who experienced um
 
07:12:37.030 --> 07:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
farmers who took their their beef for
 
07:12:40.070 --> 07:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
example to a USDA Butcher and then got
 
07:12:43.310 --> 07:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
back meat that was mislabeled like like
 
07:12:45.190 --> 07:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
cuz I've I've had experien with that
 
07:12:47.190 --> 07:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
somebody we buy from where it's like
 
07:12:49.310 --> 07:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
labeled like a ribey and it's like
 
07:12:51.670 --> 07:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
that's a top round does do they not even
 
07:12:52.628 --> 07:12:52.638 align:start position:0%
know what they're you know what I mean
 
07:12:54.070 --> 07:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
do they know know what they're doing
 
07:12:55.750 --> 07:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
anymore I mean have you experience that
 
07:12:57.868 --> 07:12:57.878 align:start position:0%
yourself uh thank you for the question
 
07:12:59.468 --> 07:12:59.478 align:start position:0%
some of my packages of meat that were
 
07:13:01.388 --> 07:13:01.398 align:start position:0%
labeled and the most recent both with
 
07:13:03.830 --> 07:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
the trade name and the farm name so they
 
07:13:05.990 --> 07:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
had I thought that I had two different
 
07:13:08.150 --> 07:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
cows coming to me because some said X
 
07:13:10.788 --> 07:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
and some said y on the label and I had
 
07:13:12.910 --> 07:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
packages with the same exact label that
 
07:13:14.670 --> 07:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
one was one pound and an entirely
 
07:13:16.628 --> 07:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
different cut than the three pound cut
 
07:13:19.708 --> 07:13:19.718 align:start position:0%
that I found on another um I think that
 
07:13:21.708 --> 07:13:21.718 align:start position:0%
the USD inspectors and the processors
 
07:13:23.190 --> 07:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
are doing their best but they're not
 
07:13:25.190 --> 07:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
perfect so we shouldn't hold New
 
07:13:27.070 --> 07:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specific people to that a
 
07:13:28.830 --> 07:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
level of perfection they can't be
 
07:13:30.150 --> 07:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
achieved by the federal government
 
07:13:32.110 --> 07:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
programs either
 
07:13:34.750 --> 07:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other
 
07:13:37.070 --> 07:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Lon
 
07:13:40.150 --> 07:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
we appreciate it thank you if I may get
 
07:13:44.548 --> 07:13:44.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:48.070 --> 07:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
there um online uh through the online
 
07:13:50.868 --> 07:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
portal we had
 
07:13:54.350 --> 07:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
326 people in support of this
 
07:13:58.548 --> 07:13:58.558 align:start position:0%
bill and 16 in
 
07:14:02.670 --> 07:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
opposition and for our sheet here we had
 
07:14:06.750 --> 07:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six seven in
 
07:14:10.468 --> 07:14:10.478 align:start position:0%
support and five in
 
07:14:13.628 --> 07:14:13.638 align:start position:0%
opposition and with that I'm going to
 
07:14:14.910 --> 07:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
close the
 
07:14:18.830 --> 07:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
07:14:22.310 --> 07:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
