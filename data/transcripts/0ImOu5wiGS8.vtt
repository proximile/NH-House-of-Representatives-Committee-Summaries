you if you think in those terms and get
 
00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 align:start position:0%
your point across that would be
 
00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.070 align:start position:0%
your point across that would be
great

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 align:start position:0%

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
to be opened and for the prime sponsor
 
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
to have more than three minutes uh but
 
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 align:start position:0%

and uh and get it done we are going to
 
00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 align:start position:0%

argue just find yourself another
seat

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
um outside of that I think we're ready
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 align:start position:0%
quorum and rep
 
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 align:start position:0%
sir so we had a discussion relative to
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
the timing of this yesterday and it was
 
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
not my impression yesterday that we were
 
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
going to limit testimony yeah in the
 
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
discussion yes fair enough in the
 
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 align:start position:0%
discussion yesterday we said we were
 
00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 align:start position:0%
going to look at the number of
 
00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
cards and and looking at the number of
 
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
cards uh if you do 3 minutes times 30 um
 
00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
that's a ton of testimony and that's
 
00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
only just to start off with so to be
 
00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
fair to every one we're going to start
 
00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
by limiting it to 3 minutes and
 
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
representative Solomon and I have agreed
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
to that um as a as a way forward we talk
 
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
point okay uh representative glasson uh
 
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
are you here to introduce HB
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
238 Mr chair yes sir I am okay the floor
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
is yours
 
00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 align:start position:0%
sir uh Mr chair thank you honorable
 
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
representatives of the committee it is
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
my uh distinct honor to represent uh to
 
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill 238 which would end
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
forced union membership as a condition
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
of employment again what this bill does
 
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
is it gives Freedom of Choice as to
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not joining a union is
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
correct for
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
you and that can't be held against you
 
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
as a condition of your
 
00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
employment in states that have done this
 
00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 align:start position:0%
before we found that unions better
 
00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
represent their membership in their
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
employees when their employees have the
 
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
influence of being able to walk away
 
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
being able to withdraw their
 
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
contributions and you know when your
 
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
membership has the power to say you're
 
00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:12.879 align:start position:0%
not well representing me and find other
 
00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
representation or self- represent
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
without continuing to pay dues the
 
00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
unions have paid more attention to their
 
00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
labor force and better represented
 
00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
them um there are also clear cases and
 
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
I'll be followed in testimony which will
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
um be able to better tell you about the
 
00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
states that have enacted this have seen
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
a decrease in unemployment and an
 
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
increase in business coming into the
 
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
state which especially in this state
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
where we have the tax problem that we
 
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
have with personal property tax would
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
bring other sources of revenue and
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
employment into the state um again if
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
this passes membership will have more
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
influence on their unions this doesn't
 
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
affect people who are happy with their
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
Union representation this does not stop
 
00:07:55.869 --> 00:07:55.879 align:start position:0%
unions from doing the best that they can
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
for their employ uh for their membership
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
if you like your you should continue to
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
participate in your union what this does
 
00:08:06.749 --> 00:08:06.759 align:start position:0%
is this makes unions an option you know
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
I want people to join unions because
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
they find Value in what the union is
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
doing for them and they recognize and
 
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
support the benefits that they're
 
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
getting out of that membership not
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
because they're forc to as a condition
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
of their
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
payroll so this is the bill that I'm
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
introducing and proud to introduce um I
 
00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
won't be taking questions because I'll
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
be followed by a lot of subject matter

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
would ask you to do that but I am going
 
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
to read an excerpt from the
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
article want to take a moment to address
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
the arguments made by those promoting
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
so-called right to work laws and the
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
claim that such legislation would
 
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
benefit New Hampshire the evidence tells
 
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
a very different story among the 27
 
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
states where right to work laws are in
 
00:10:24.509 --> 00:10:24.519 align:start position:0%
effect wages and standards of living are
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
constantly lower compared to states
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
without these laws take West Virginia
 
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
for example when right to work was
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
enacted there it failed to attract new
 
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
business or spur economic growth even
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
West Virginia governor Jim Justice
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledged the reality in Stark terms
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
quote really and truly let's just be
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
brutally honest Governor Justice said
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
during a town hall meeting we passed the
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
right to work law West Virginia we ran
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
to the windows looked to see all the
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
people that were going to come and guess
 
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
what they didn't come we got rid of
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
prevailing wage we changed our corporate
 
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
tax taxes we've done a lot of different
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
things and we run to the windows and
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
they haven't come we've absolutely built
 
00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
the field in a lot of different places
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
thinking building the field they'll come
 
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
and they didn't come right to Work
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
legislation has been sponsored in this
 
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
state for well over 30 to 35 times this
 
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
is my 11th time at bat as head of this
 
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:22.519 align:start position:0%
organization testifying against it for
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
the life of me what I can't understand
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
is why um Republican party which
 
00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
preaches Less business Le uh less
 
00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
interference with business less
 
00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
government wants to interfere with
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
agreements between a business and their
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
employees no one is forced to join a
 
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
union that fair share clause which was
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
referenced by the the sponsor of this
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
bill has to be negotiated between the
 
00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:52.279 align:start position:0%
business and the employees and I think
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
we should stay out of the business of
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
Private Business government has no
 
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
business in that and um with that thank
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you sir are there any
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
questions represent McKenzie thank you
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh president Gull uh the the discussion
 
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
about whether or not somebody's forced
 
00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
to join a union can you just give us a
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
sense of of that how that works in the
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
SEIU um no one's forced to join um we go
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
to an orientation we talk about um the
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
benefits of joining a Union and if
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
someone wants to join then they're
 
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
eligible to join if they don't they
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
don't it's literally how it works thank
 
00:12:41.949 --> 00:12:41.959 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you so much thank you for
 
00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:45.199 align:start position:0%

00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
judge good morning Mr chairman members
 
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
is Greg Moore I'm a regional director
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
with Americans for Prosperity and I'm
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
here today test in support of House Bill
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
238 um I'll tell a few quick stories
 
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
that I have while I have the through the
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
three minutes the first one is why this
 
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
issue is personal to me I was working at
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
DHHS as a director in 2005 and 2006 when
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
the state enacted an agency fee and I
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
had one of my employees come in tears
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
about the fact that money was being
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
withheld from her paycheck despite the
 
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
fact that she didn't agree with the
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
direction the union was bargaining on
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
her behalf um fundamentally I think that
 
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
that's why a lot of PE a lot of
 
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
non-members in Union environments don't
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
join is because they don't feel as
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
though the Union's best negotiating in
 
00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:35.959 align:start position:0%
their interest and I would say and I
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
would say that that uh that's a lot of
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
the reason it's I I liken it to this
 
00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
it's like going to a restaurant or
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
ordering a chicken Caesar salad getting
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
a cheeseburger told you have to pay for
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
the cheeseburger and if you complain
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
about it you're called ungrateful Second
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
Story uh with one of our activists
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
worked in Massachusetts in a union shop
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
he was part of a a smaller younger group
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
of people who were on a 401K plan there
 
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
was an older larger group more senior
 
00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
folks who were on a Divine benefit plan
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
for them uh they uh they had a
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
negotiation and the negotiating team
 
00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
which is largely made up of older
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
members got more money into the defined
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
benefit plan and the younger workers got
 
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
nothing now in a right to work state
 
00:14:19.949 --> 00:14:19.959 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't happen because those those
 
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
uh members would immediately leave
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
because they would it would be obvious
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
that they're not negotiating on their
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
behalf third quick story when I was
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
working as uh I before with I was AFP
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
was a chief of staff of the house and in
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
2011 we passed right to work in the
 
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
house passed right to work in the Senate
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
and then it was an interim period
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
because the governor vetoed it waiting
 
00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:39.759 align:start position:0%
for the veto day we used to have
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
business owners actually show up across
 
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
the street come up and talk to the
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
speaker and tell us that they would that
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
if we passed right to work they would
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
move to the state now I was curious I
 
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
didn't know why and I wanted to know why
 
00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:52.519 align:start position:0%
they would do that and because you hear
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
the argument that there's less pay
 
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
that's not had nothing to do with it at
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
all the reason why they want to come to
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
a right to work state is because there's
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
more labor peace people in in the union
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
are happier and that helps to in
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
incentivize Recruitment and Retention
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
and particularly in the manufacturing
 
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
space getting and keeping good people is
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
really critical so for all these reasons
 
00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:11.959 align:start position:0%
and I could go on for more but I get
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
three minutes so I'll stop there and be
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir any questions
 
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.030 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir any questions
representative

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
Schultz thank you Mr chair good to see
 
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr Moore um I'm curious to know
 
00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
because I know Americans for Prosperity
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
um has spoken on this in the past I'm
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
curious to know if if you or your
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
organization supports the right for
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
unions to exist at all absolutely thank
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
you for the question uh we believe that
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
people if they want to get together and
 
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
engage in Collective action that's fine
 
00:15:46.829 --> 00:15:46.839 align:start position:0%
uh the real challenge that we have uh
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
comes from the Wagner Act which states
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
back to 1935 that says that if 50% plus
 
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
one member of a bargaining unit decide
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
to join a union the minority lose all
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
their rights they lose their right to
 
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
negot neate they lose the right to
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
represent themselves they lose all their
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
rights and have to go exclusively
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
through the union so fundamentally the
 
00:16:08.189 --> 00:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
the challenge we have is is with
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
exclusive representation not not unions
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
themselves but thank you for the
 
00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
question I'm glad to
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
clarify representative K thank you Mr
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
chair and uh thank you Mr Moore uh what
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
you just described is sounds like
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
democracy are you opposed to democracy
 
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm could you please explain yeah
 
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
well you said said the members decide
 
00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:34.519 align:start position:0%
they vote at 50% plus one uh wants to
 
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
have a union then they have a union and
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
the other people you feel aren't
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
represented but I think in fact that
 
00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:43.959 align:start position:0%
negotiations and benefits and everything
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
negotiated by the union apply to
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
everyone who does work in that in that
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
company so it seems to me they are
 
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
getting a benefit you're just you just
 
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
reluctant to pay the agency fee to help
 
00:16:59.949 --> 00:16:59.959 align:start position:0%
cover the cost but to my point 50 % plus
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
one in a vote that's how democracy Works
 
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:04.839 align:start position:0%
correct and and thankfully we don't have
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
a democracy in the US we have a
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional republic where our rights
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
constitution my goodness I I thought we
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
did have democracy in where we we vote
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
and the majority wins I'm sorry Gman
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
this is not a an argument back and forth
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
questions and answers please any other
 
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039 align:start position:0%
questions representa
 
00:17:26.189 --> 00:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
Soloman thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
question um you mentioned that um
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
businesses have been talking about uh
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
wanting to come to uh New Hampshire if
 
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
we pass right to work could you name a
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
few of those businesses that are anxious
 
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
to come to New Hampshire under those
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances and that's and that's the
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
game right there uh the The Business
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
Leaders would come up they would say if
 
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
you pass right to work we'll pass it
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
however until you pass right to work you
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
cannot mention that we said
 
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
that and there's a reason for that
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
because because undoubtedly there would
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
be trouble caused back within the other
 
00:17:59.549 --> 00:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
New England States in which they're
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
located and they said and they made
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear that they that they are
 
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
not willing to put their name to
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
anything for that
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
reason are there any other
 
00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
questions all right oh I'm sorry
 
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie thank you thank
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
Moore uh you uh suggested that organized
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
labor um promotes
 
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
unrest you talked about Labor
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
Peace So are are you suggesting that
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
organized labor um uh promotes unrest
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
and undermines uh the economic
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
conditions in New Hampshire undermines
 
00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:40.039 align:start position:0%
the economic the economy generally
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
speaking in New Hampshire so when I
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned labor piece what I meant was
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
when the union is representing the
 
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
entirety of the workforce the entirety
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
of the bargaining unit that is a more
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
harmonious workplace if you have a
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
scenario where you can have a majority
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
of the people decide that they want some
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
want something and they get it and the
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
minority of the people did not want it
 
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
and they're left out and excluded then
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
that that's obviously going to leave
 
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
them less happy and less likely to stay
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
and less likely to encourage their
 
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.070 align:start position:0%
 
workplace

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
workplace
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
sir repr LK thank you Mr chair so
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this legislation kind of mess
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
with the harmony of unions by saying
 
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
okay if you want to be a member but
 
00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
don't want to pay dues or you know help
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
um help keep the union strong isn't that
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
saying you know you can pay you don't
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
have to pay if you don't want to but
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't that create
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
unrest I don't know how it creates
 
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
unrest when the union is more focused on
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
making sure all their members are happy
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
I think that would create um a more
 
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.549 align:start position:0%
I think that would create um a more
positive

00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
workplace yeah thank you Mr
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:19:59.710 --> 00:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
question if you do not want to be a
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
member of the union and you're in a
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
union shop how are you are you able to
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
independently negotiate your own wages
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
and just say I'm going to do it on my
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
own under federal law no if you have a a
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
a bargaining unit that has been
 
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
certified by the National Labor
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
Relations Board you lose your ability to
 
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
go and negotiate for your own uh
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
compensation benefits time off anything
 
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
like that it is exclusively done by on
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
on behalf of of the Union
 
00:20:28.919 --> 00:20:30.190 align:start position:0%
on behalf of of the Union
thank

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
you representative McKenzie uh can you
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
uh uh provide uh just heard the term
 
00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:38.789 align:start position:0%
uh uh provide uh just heard the term
Union

00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
Union
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
shop so what is a union shop so a union
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
shop is is well it depends if you have a
 
00:20:48.669 --> 00:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
certified Union shop one is certified by
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
the National Labor Relations Board it is
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
a shop that wherein there has been a a a
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
union organizing effort where where one
 
00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
Union has gotten certified by 50% plus
 
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
one that's not the only type of Union
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
shop there are member only unions there
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
are actually some workplaces that have
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
multiple member only unions that
 
00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
represent their people and the people
 
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
who are not member of of the member on
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
unions negotiate on their own
 
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
behalf but there are no there are no clo
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
shops under Taft heartley there are no
 
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
close shops I think I think that's what
 
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
you're getting at that's what I'm
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
getting okay I want so we got there
 
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
followup for a followup so close shop
 
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:28.360 align:start position:0%
would mean that you could not work in
 
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.029 align:start position:0%
would mean that you could not work in
that

00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
in that facility if you didn't join the
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
union correct between 1935 and 1947
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
there were closed shops
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
where full union membership was a
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
condition of employment right no longer
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
the case that's that V outlawed by Taff
 
00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
Harley in 1947 the same legislation that
 
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
created the right to work
 
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
exception so people can join don't have
 
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
to join the union they can work in a
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
shop that's a union shop and don't have
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
to join the union is that you have
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
testimony that's correct that's federal
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
law thank you repr Granger thank you Mr
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
if you if you have these protections
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned that means that you
 
00:22:12.269 --> 00:22:12.279 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay union dues or pay to
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
the union anything correct if you're not
 
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
a member of the union or no correct if
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
if uh if New Hampshire were to become
 
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
the 27th right to work
 
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
state uh if you are not a member you
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
would not have to pay any fees or dues
 
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:28.039 align:start position:0%
to the union thank you very much
 
00:22:28.039 --> 00:22:29.590 align:start position:0%
to the union thank you very much
representative

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
brard thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:35.559 align:start position:0%
for taking my question with studies
 
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
indicating that right to work states
 
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
often have higher rates of
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
workplace injuries how can you ensure me
 
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
that weakening unions won't lead to less
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement of safety regulations in New
 
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think that's a great
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
question there have been some studies
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
looking specifically at that uh one of
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
the challenges is that the states are
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
right to work states are often more
 
00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
Agricultural and agricultural uh
 
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
environments actually lead to higher
 
00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
workplace accidents so that's one
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
important factor to keep in mind but uh
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
there have been a number of studies I
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
saw one by the MAA Institute that uh
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
basically undermined the notion that
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
that um it's less safe to work in a
 
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
state with Right to Work protections I
 
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
wish I had that study with
 
00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:23.799 align:start position:0%
me I
 
00:23:27.149 --> 00:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
laby thank you Mr chair uh good to see
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr Moore question for you regarding
 
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
the North Country um the North Country
 
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
could use industry it doesn't have much
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
and it could use a hand how would this
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
law help or hurt the North Country well
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
I would think the the North country and
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um as my
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh I would I
 
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
would assume that that the place that
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
businesses coming to New Hampshire would
 
00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
First Look would be the North country
 
00:23:55.149 --> 00:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
and that's because a there's space
 
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
available and B there's more workers
 
00:23:59.310 --> 00:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
available it is hard as as you know as a
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
business owner it's hard to find people
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
these days in Southern New Hampshire uh
 
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
so I would think that the North Country
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
would be uniquely positioned to benefit
 
00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:10.039 align:start position:0%
from the passage of a right to work
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
law repres
 
00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:14.070 align:start position:0%
law repres
McKenzie

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
McKenzie
 
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
uh are you familiar with the history of
 
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
the North country in terms of the union
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
movement I uh representative I am
 
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
familiar uh as it turns out when I was
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
working at DHHS was when they were
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
closing many of the mills in Lancaster
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
and uh in in Berlin so so the that was a
 
00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:34.039 align:start position:0%
union town there were thousands of union
 
00:24:42.269 --> 00:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
Berlin okay any further
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
questions represent brard thank you Mr
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
question uh given that right to work
 
00:24:54.909 --> 00:24:54.919 align:start position:0%
laws correlate with fewer
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
employer um sponsor benefits
 
00:25:00.909 --> 00:25:00.919 align:start position:0%
how can you ensure me that New
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's workers won't see a decline
 
00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
in health coverage and retirement
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
options what defines benefits and and
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
what defines compensation is is usually
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
Marketplace forces uh at today and in an
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
environment where you can talk to any
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
small business owner or anyone who's
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
hiring anybody uh you can't for example
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
hire people in in the greater Manchester
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
area for any less than about $20 an hour
 
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
you just can't and so fundamentally what
 
00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
tends to drive compensation and benefit
 
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
are are
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
essentially Market forces competing for
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
labor particularly when you have Labor
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
scarcity unemployment in New Hampshire
 
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
is 2% and the greatest challenge that we
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
would have uh for employers looking to
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire or finding a
 
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce and you can and doesn't take
 
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
much you can talk to any any employer
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
around they'll tell you that the biggest
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
problem they have is finding and keeping
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative K thank you Mr
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
chair Mr MOA do you really think that
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
rights to work is the biggest concern
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
that employers have when looking at a
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
state uh don't you think that uh
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing and educated Workforce
 
00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
uh School functions uh schools that are
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
functioning well and and well financed
 
00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
and maintained don't you think those are
 
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
other considerations for both businesses
 
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
and workers I can tell you that there
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
are many considerations every single
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
employer on making decision for sighting
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
it looks at a number of different
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
factors for example up until about 10
 
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
years ago we had some of the highest uh
 
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
business taxes in in in the country we
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
were 40 ranked 47th uh thankfully over
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
the course of the last 10 years we have
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
made our business tax environment much
 
00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
more competitive and that spurred a
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
significant number of amount of economic
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
growth so to your point yes there are a
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
number of factors that businesses
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
consider when they decide to relocate
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
right to work is simply one of them
 
00:26:55.559 --> 00:26:56.389 align:start position:0%
right to work is simply one of them
thank

00:26:56.389 --> 00:26:56.399 align:start position:0%

633 and I am a resident of hookit I'm

hookit uh and I come to testify an
 
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill uh prior to my
 
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
career as a business agent because the
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
last thing I think you guys want to hear
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
is some testimony of the quote unquote
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
Union boss I was a rank and file member
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
of teamer local 633 at Associated
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
groceries where I operated at forklift
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh I could sit here and tell you the
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
talking points of anti-right to work
 
00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
being it drives down wages it drives
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
down benefits but that's not what I'm
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
here to tell you uh if it were not for
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
my union and the and the benefits
 
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
negotiated uh by local 633 when I was a
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
ranked file member I physically would
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
not be here to make this testimony today
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
as a rank and file member at Associated
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
groceries I was diagnosed with stage 4 a
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
scream aell carcinoma tonsil
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
cancer during those treatments my union
 
00:28:30.029 --> 00:28:30.039 align:start position:0%
negotiat health insurance saved my life
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
on more than one occasion the nurses the
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
doctors all went to my wife and said
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
your your husband is getting the best uh
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
care due to his health insurance I was
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
never once asked to leave the facility
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
to free up a bed which I know happens uh
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
when you have health insurances that
 
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
don't do what they're supposed to do
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
that never happened once I was cleared
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
and go back to work uh my FMLA uh
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
protections had run out uh my union was
 
00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:57.559 align:start position:0%
able to keep my job my position I was
 
00:28:59.950 --> 00:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
able to go back to work all right
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
without the negotiated benefits uh by
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
unions uh the American worker especially
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
workers in New Hampshire will be
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
completely unprotected make no mistake
 
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
about it Right to Work legislation is
 
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
strictly a way to weaken unions and take
 
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
away negotiating power from the people
 
00:29:19.389 --> 00:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
that are trying to negotiate and take
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh let me see
 
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
oh yeah so again with the uh terms and
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
conditions which I worked under I had
 
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
short-term disability coverage uh when I
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
was out and that was the only money
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
coming in when I was out not being able
 
00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:39.519 align:start position:0%
to work to provide groceries for my
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
family you overall being a part of a
 
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
union uh has been the best decision uh
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
right to work laws are just bad for the
 
00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
American worker bad for New Hampshire we
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
have fought this fight for the last 30
 
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
plus years and it always gets shot down
 
00:29:55.509 --> 00:29:55.519 align:start position:0%
right uh in my opinion and and my
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
professional life as a business agent
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
I've heard I've heard some testimony
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
already about work shortages and and
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
needing employers excuse me needing uh
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
workers uh in my experience there's not
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
really a worker shortage those employers
 
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
who provide the best wages benefits and
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
retirement are not looking for employees
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
because they say fully staffed you know
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of of unions uh here
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
to protect the workers create create
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
safe working environments good wages and
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh under retirement and great health
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
insurance so uh I could again tell you
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
how Right to Work lowers wages benefits
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
safety but I don't want to I only got
 
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
three minutes so I will make that my
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
testimony answer any questions that you
 
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:40.600 align:start position:0%

00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%

chair um Mr judge I'm so glad that your
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
health uh and everything I'm sure that
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
everybody feels this way I'm so glad it
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
worked out for you um I'm sad that uh
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
some folks don't have that coverage and
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
as I will as a point of personal
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
privilege I'm a granddaughter and
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
daughter of a teamers so I really
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here thank
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
um why do you think under President
 
00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:12.919 align:start position:0%
Trump the GOP has removed the right to
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
work um plank from the national
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
Republican platform and I am aware that
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
your union internationally did not take
 
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
a stand on the presidential election as
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
a Democrat I was smid and sad about that
 
00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
but I think in this sense uh this this
 
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
question is is a good one to ask you as
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
a Teamster can you ref uh repeat the
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
question yes why why do you think that
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
under President Trump the GOP took the
 
00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:42.039 align:start position:0%
plank supporting right to work um out of
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
the national platform for the for the
 
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
Republican Party under President
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
Trump's um leadership uh I can only give
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
you my opinion I know that recently the
 
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
Republican party has attempted to become
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
the uh party of the working people uh
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
that may have been a step in the right
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
direction uh you know but I believe it's
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
no disrespect it's a bit of sod because
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
one of the first uh bills here in New
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right out of the gate with a
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
republican uh Governor is is Right to
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
Work uh I do believe there are great
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
Republicans especially here in New
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who have sided with us uh but
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
I do believe inherently it's still part
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
of their National platform even if
 
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
they're not out in
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
front are there any further questions
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
one quick one every ler thank you uh
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr judge for your testimony my
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
dad was a teamer to and he was very sick
 
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
for a long time and his benefits kept
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
him alive until uh he finally
 
00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
succumbed to uh with cancer but my
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
question is are you forced to pay dues
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
or you do it voluntarily say that again
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
are you forced to pay dues or do you do
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
it voluntarily no um in all of
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
our in all of our public sector
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
contracts you can you can op out from
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
paying dues uh but in our private sector
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
contracts uh those that have uh those
 
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the contract are voted on
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
uh by all the members at Contract
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
renewal and there's also the um
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
objective fee so you're not forced to
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
pay dues if you don't if you so choose
 
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.629 align:start position:0%
pay dues if you don't if you so choose
not

00:33:12.629 --> 00:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
to every
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
Flanigan thank you Mr chairman I too
 
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
Paid Dues to the teamsters when I was in
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
college I didn't get any benefits other
 
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
than maybe a better pay and allow me to
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
work it but I am also glad that you're
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
doing well thanks sir um there was
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
something that was brought up um oh when
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
you say you're voluntarily paying uh
 
00:33:39.389 --> 00:33:39.399 align:start position:0%
your dues you didn't bring up agency is
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
agency viewed as different than
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
dues the uh obor fee is that agency fee
 
00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
agency fee public sector that's the now
 
00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
know the Janice decision right but do
 
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.430 align:start position:0%
know the Janice decision right but do
you

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
have with the private I
 
00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
understand is there an opport
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
where even in the private sector that an
 
00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
individual an employee can just pay the
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
agency fee the cost of negotiating like
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
yes you call it something different than
 
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
yeah it's the same thing uh what was not
 
00:34:13.069 --> 00:34:13.079 align:start position:0%
brought up and what I'd like to mention
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
under that uh if Right to Work were to
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
pass uh Unions would be obligated to
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
represent those employees who are not
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
paying dues or an objective fee at all
 
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
and I would believe uh I stand to be
 
00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
corrected that unions are the only
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
organization in this country that would
 
00:34:28.589 --> 00:34:28.599 align:start position:0%
be forced to provide
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh services to people without paying for
 
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
them uh I is a not a member of AAA could
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
not call triaa and say hey I'm broke
 
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
down on the side of the road come change
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
my tire the first thing they're going to
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
do is say are you uh a are you a member
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
and B are you dues paid up and if
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not comeing to
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
change your tire so I think it's
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
inherently wrong that under right to
 
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
work laws Unions would be forced to
 
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
represent uh people who aren't paying
 
00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:54.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
share uh for a quick followup so
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
basically your answer is yeah you can
 
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
either pay dues or you call it something
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
different than agency fee right you have
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
a the objective fee thank you very much
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
question so you mentioned that um you
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
guys are the unions are forced to
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
represent people who are not members of
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
the unions are there unions that do not
 
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.710 align:start position:0%
the unions are there unions that do not
represent

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
illegal for a quick followup what about
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
the members only
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
unions I'm not unaware of anyone in New

asking questions and it's it's not a
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
political form for statements and those
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%

part um I'm appearing before you today
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
to strongly oppose uh House Bill 23 8 FN
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
um as others have or will note with all
 
00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
of the cards um this bill is nothing
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
more than attempt to deceive and confuse
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with real rights it
 
00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with real work and it
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
won't create real work it simply permits
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
a few to Advantage themselves at the
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
expense of others and those few will
 
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
endure no cost no
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
sacrifice um uh at in in a in a right to
 
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.069 align:start position:0%
sacrifice um uh at in in a in a right to
work

00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
situation this bill actually undermines
 
00:37:05.309 --> 00:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
the competitive balance that workers
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
seek to achieve in a free market through
 
00:37:08.079 --> 00:37:09.190 align:start position:0%
seek to achieve in a free market through
Collective

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
Collective
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
action it is anti-competitive to allow
 
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
some to take advantage of that
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
Collective action without participating
 
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
in it or supporting
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
it we've seen the debilitating impacts
 
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
of socalled Right to Work legislation on
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
workers in many other states the data
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
from the e Economic Policy Institute
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
shows full-time workers in states that
 
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
have adopted this falsely named and
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
deceptively intended
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
legislation can earn nearly $1,700 less
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
per year with no no measurable gains in
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
employment the race to the Bottom by
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
states to attract companies by offering
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
lower wages than their neighbors can be
 
00:37:55.309 --> 00:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
seen simply by driving along the banks
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
of the marac and Manchester
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
those Mills now do employ people but if
 
00:38:05.309 --> 00:38:05.319 align:start position:0%
you were here in New Hampshire 30 or 40
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
or 50 years ago those Mills were
 
00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:12.200 align:start position:0%
empty all of that work taken by Amis and
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
other manufactures to the
 
00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:20.839 align:start position:0%
South for lower pay that was all it was
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
about and having lived in Mississippi
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
for 10 years I can tell you that all of
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
those companies that mov to the South
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
have now moved to Mexico or southeast
 
00:38:34.109 --> 00:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
Asia again in that race to the
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
bottom in the 1950s more than a third of
 
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
us workers were unionized and our
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
economy grew to become the Envy of the
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
world with GDP growth averaging more
 
00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.790 align:start position:0%
world with GDP growth averaging more
than

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
4% today only one in 10 workers are
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
unionized and GDP growth is less than
 
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
half of what it was when unions were
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
strong the evidence is clear unions not
 
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
only do not cost jobs or limit rights
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
they support living wages Fair working
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
conditions if youve just heard and they
 
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
actually create an educated and safe
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
Workforce that is the attraction for
 
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
most all right sir your time is up thank
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
you thank you so much any
 
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
questions Schultz Mr chair I just wanted
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
to point out that he has a typed version
 
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
of his speech and as a former Clerk of
 
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
this committee I think it's helpful for
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
us to have copies of that in the in the
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
main folder for the record absolutely
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I did bring copies so okay if
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
we can hand those around that would be
 
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you for your testimony
 
00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:42.870 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you for your testimony
thank

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
you I'd like to call John Reynolds

please and on Deck
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the opportunity
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
to testify today thank you sorry I hope
 
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
I didn't jump the gun uh my name is John
 
00:40:08.349 --> 00:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
Reynolds I'm the state director for the
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
national Federation of Independent
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
Business in New Hampshire we represent
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
over 1700 small businesses in every
 
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
sector in every corner of the State uh
 
00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
our mission is to promote and protect
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
the right of our members to own operate
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
and grow their
 
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
business excuse me
 
00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
uh fundamentally our members believe
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
that right to work work is about
 
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
allowing small business owners and their
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
employees to determine their own future
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh in nfib surveys of New Hampshire
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
small businesses over 80% support right
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
to work and notably in other states when
 
00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
the question has come up about retaining
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
the policy support is even higher closer
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
to 90% uh also academic research backs
 
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
the benefits of right to work and there
 
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
are a number of studies some of which
 
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
I've cited in the letter that was
 
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
distributed uh I think one of the most
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
notable ones is a 2021 study by
 
00:40:58.990 --> 00:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
researchers at University which examined
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
the long-range impacts of right to work
 
00:41:03.069 --> 00:41:03.079 align:start position:0%
in Border counties and states that with
 
00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
and without the policy and the study
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
looked at not only counties immediately
 
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
adjacent to the Border but one County in
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
on each side as well so effectively it
 
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
would apply to the entire city New
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and what they found in
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
addition to evidence uh to suggest
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
higher average wages the researchers at
 
00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
Harvard also concluded that right to
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
work is associated with higher
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
population growth higher employment to
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
population higher share of manuf
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
facturing employment higher rates of
 
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
upward economic Mobility lower rates of
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
unemployment and lower rates of poverty
 
00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
so in some we want continued economic
 
00:41:39.069 --> 00:41:39.079 align:start position:0%
growth in the state of New Hampshire we
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
want New Hampshire to be an even more
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
attractive place for people to live work
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
raise a family start a business and
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
that's why we believe that right to work
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
is the right policy at the right time
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:53.069 --> 00:41:53.079 align:start position:0%
again thank you sir I appreciate that
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
representative Susi thank you Mr
 
00:41:56.349 --> 00:41:56.359 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
question so I'm sure that every
 
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
representative in here received the same
 
00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
letter um from the citizens or right to
 
00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.030 align:start position:0%
letter um from the citizens or right to
work

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
movement and for years I've been here
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
this is my eth term so I've been dealing
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
with this for 14 years and that letter
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
that we received said that 80% of New
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens believe that they
 
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
should have the right to work do you
 
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
have data to back that up because it
 
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
hasn't changed the number hasn't changed
 
00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
in all the letters that I've received
 
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
over 14 years Mr chair representative
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
Susi uh nfib is not affiliated or
 
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
associated with the I'm sorry which
 
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
organization did you say for Right to
 
00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:38.599 align:start position:0%
Work movement because you had mentioned
 
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
you that right to work people in New
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 80% of the people in New
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire believe that it's right to
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
work is the right thing to do and I'm
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
asking if you have any data to back that
 
00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
up yes uh so the number I cited which is
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
the act the specific number I think is
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
about 82% support 5 or 6% oppose 11% or
 
00:42:56.549 --> 00:42:56.559 align:start position:0%
so have no opinion that comes from an
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
nfib member survey of small businesses
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any other broad-based
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
poll or survey of small businesses in
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
the state on this question so I and
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
again we're just speaking for ourselves
 
00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
and our
 
00:43:14.589 --> 00:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
members I was ask
 
00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:16.839 align:start position:0%
solivan thank you for Mr chair and thank
 
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh you
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
referenced a Harvard study
 
00:43:25.549 --> 00:43:25.559 align:start position:0%
um can you um tell us exactly who the
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
author of that study was and uh what
 
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
their background is um I can I certainly
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
can share a copy of the study with all
 
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee I know the
 
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
last names of the researchers were
 
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
Austin and Lily the title is the long

run long run effects of right to work
 
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
laws it was published on November 16th
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
of 2021 I'd be happy to follow up with

you over email with a copy of the study
 
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:49.720 align:start position:0%
thank you

followup yes
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
sir are you aware that that study was
 
00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.390 align:start position:0%
sir are you aware that that study was
not

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed uh I looked um was not
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
aware it was peer-reviewed I looked for
 
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
any other uh studies that refuted the
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
findings and I didn't find
 
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
any thank you and
 
00:44:14.589 --> 00:44:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
ma'am okay thank you so much I was
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
exactly uh thank you and thank you for
 
00:44:22.549 --> 00:44:22.559 align:start position:0%
taking the question would you just uh
 
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
explain to me what a small business is
 
00:44:27.069 --> 00:44:27.079 align:start position:0%
how many people and it's like an ex
 
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:29.720 align:start position:0%
essal question uh so there's a lot of
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
different um thresholds for small
 
00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
businesses I'll just say 80 I forget if
 
00:44:35.549 --> 00:44:35.559 align:start position:0%
I said this at the outset so I apologize
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
if I'm repeating myself but for us our
 
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
80% of our members employ 20 people or
 
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
fewer so you know we tend to be on the
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
very small side uh if you look at the
 
00:44:46.349 --> 00:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
United States ball Business Association
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh the federal SBA um they're General
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
across the board threshold right for
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
between large and small as 500 employees
 
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
um and then when you get into industry
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
specific Thresh it ranges between you
 
00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:00.839 align:start position:0%
know 100 less than 100 could be a small
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
business in some cases or less than 1500
 
00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
could be a small business in some cases
 
00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
if you look at different Federal Acts
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
like the federal Family Medical and
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
Leave Act 50 and or I'm sorry under 50
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
employees are exempt from that
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
regulation so you could argue right
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's a threshold same thing for the
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act Right the employer
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
mandate to provide coverages applies to
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
50 and
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
above thank you representative farington
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
taking the question I believe that West
 
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
Virginia is the closest state with Right
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
to Work legislation given that what
 
00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
effect would having passing this have on
 
00:45:40.109 --> 00:45:40.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire small businesses yeah um
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
I'll again point back to the Harvard
 
00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
study which is also supported by earlier
 
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
research I think and here I think I
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
cited a paper from the Federal Reserve
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
Bank of Richmond uh right and the
 
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
findings in both instances and other
 
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
academic research right so strongly
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
suggests higher employment higher rates
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
of employment lower poverty um higher
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
rates of employment in sectors that uh
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
are known for having good pay good
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
benefits like manufacturing um so I
 
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
think the the benefits right we we would
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
be a leader in in New England uh by
 
00:46:14.549 --> 00:46:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
law representative kahill thank you Mr
 
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
question uh in New Hampshire really the
 
00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of employers in the
 
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
state are small businesses and we
 
00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.670 align:start position:0%
state are small businesses and we
appreciate

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
and uh you know their concerned and
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
uh 84% have fewer than 15 employees do
 
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
you have any idea how many currently are
 
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
have unions in those businesses and is
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
businesses was a timed out on me I think
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
um sorry representative I'm just
 
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
replaying your question in my head uh do
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
I have data on could you repeat the
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
question apologize well there are 84% of
 
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
the com of the businesses in New
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the small businesses where our
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
small business they have 15 employees or
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
fewer are could you have any an idea of
 
00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
how many of those have unions in those
 
00:47:27.069 --> 00:47:27.079 align:start position:0%
businesses to that part of the question
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
I I don't have the rate of unionization
 
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
in that size business off the top of my
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
head but I'd certainly be happy to track
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
it down and follow up with you after the
 
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
committee to your second question about
 
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
the level of I believe it was about the
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
level of concern uh yes if I if I may
 
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you well I I believe that
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
there are probably very few it's my
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
belief that there are probably very few
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
unions operating in such small
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
businesses and we have so many small
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
businesses in New Hampshire I just
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
wonder if that's this issue is a real
 
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
pressing concern for our small
 
00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:01.559 align:start position:0%
businesses in New
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I I can you know speak from
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
talking to small business owner I can
 
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
speak from just personal experience
 
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
without having data in front of me I
 
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
know that you know there are certainly
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
Union shops um with fewer than 15 20 25
 
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
whatever number you want to pick to
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
Define small employer right there there
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
certainly what number that is I I will
 
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
follow up after committee uh as to the
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
level of concern I could speak to our
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
membership right um and the way that
 
00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
nfib works is that we every year survey
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
our members on a range of questions a
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
range of policy issues we ask them you
 
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
know do you support or oppose this
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
policy and over 80% supported right to
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
work so I glean from that that this is
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
an issue of concern for a lot of our
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
members thank you m Jan Flanigan thank
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and just as a point of
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
clarification unless it has changed I
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
thought uh you had to have at least 10
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
employees to unionize in the state of
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
that was public employers
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you so much sir thank
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%

who mowed your fields which you kept
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
back by fraud cry out and the cries of
 
00:50:17.789 --> 00:50:17.799 align:start position:0%
the Harvesters have reached the ears of
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
the Lord of
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
hosts right to work laws risk silencing
 
00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:26.799 align:start position:0%
these cries by weakening the collective

voice of workers making it harder for
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
them to advocate for just wages safe
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
working conditions and the dignity they
 
00:50:37.789 --> 00:50:37.799 align:start position:0%
deserve as Christians we are also called

00:50:56.829 --> 00:50:56.839 align:start position:0%
undermines this solidarity it Fosters
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
Division and creates economic
 
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
instability for families and
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
communities by diminishing the power of

workers to negotiate
 
00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839 align:start position:0%
collectively this legislation threatens
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
not just to harm
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
individuals but the moral fabric of New

vulnerable data indicates as you've
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
heard that these laws often result in
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
lower wages and reduced benefits
 
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impacting those who
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
are already struggling to make ends meet
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
we are called to create a society where

00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
that thank you oh thank you so our Union
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
is called the student workers Collective
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth and we were established in
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
2022 we were the fifth undergraduate
 
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
labor union to emerge in the United
 
00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
States and we are here in strong
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
opposition to this Right to Work bill
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
between my freshman and sophomore years
 
00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
of college our independent student Le
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
Union was able to negotiate a platform
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
of workplace benefits to secure all
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
undergraduate dining employees at $21
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
base wage and sick pay our union dues
 
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:43.240 align:start position:0%
are just 2% which is 2 cents for every
 
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
dollar um and they go towards
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
supplementing our hardship fund and
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
sourcing legal support as we bargain
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
against our 8 billion doll institutions
 
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
lawyers our wages were raised 40% and
 
00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
through our on the ground organizing
 
00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
effort efforts uh we were able to
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
increase it from just earning 12 to
 
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
$21 um and to this day our dues only
 
00:54:05.549 --> 00:54:05.559 align:start position:0%
take a fraction of our paycheck but they
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
Chang the trajectory of every single
 
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
worker at Dartmouth
 
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
College yeah I think it's really
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
important to note that before our Union
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
formed at our College just two years ago
 
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
we often as low-income students felt
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
like we were workers first and students
 
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
second that our purpose was to serve our
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
more affluent peers um when I first got
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
to college before we had a union I was
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
working upwards of 40 hours a week I was
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
choosing my classes around my work
 
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
schedule instead of the other way around
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
the union has dramatically impacted our
 
00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
ability to be students and to be members
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
of our community um I think it's also
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
really critical to understand that dues
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
are a very very small fraction of our
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
paycheck compared to the benefits we get
 
00:54:56.109 --> 00:54:56.119 align:start position:0%
when we unionized if you deduct the 2%
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
in do is that go towards supporting our
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
Union which is an independent Union it
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
is Rank and file Leed we as student
 
00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
workers are the ones doing all the
 
00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
support work to keep it going filing the
 
00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
Grievances negotiating with the
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
college's lawyers who make more money
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
than we'll ever see and it is really
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
important to know that that is a 38% net
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
increase in wages on top of that we got
 
00:55:19.789 --> 00:55:19.799 align:start position:0%
more benefits like sick pay and mental
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
health pay and so this idea that people
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
are at risk of losing money when they
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
are obligated to pay dues for Union
 
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
representation does not play out in
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
reality I think um another note is that
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
our dues um which are democratically
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
ladies that's uh your time is up subject
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
to any questions representative Granger
 
00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:43.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
taking my questions so was the Dartmouth
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock Union in any way involved with
 
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
the decision by uh Dartmouth K Hitchcock
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
to deny kidney transplants to those who
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
refuse the Corona virus shots
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
we do not represent um medical workers
 
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:01.720 align:start position:0%
at all we represent student dining
 
00:56:04.109 --> 00:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
workers and undergraduate advisers
 
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
completely different unions thank you
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
very much any other
 
00:56:08.799 --> 00:56:10.309 align:start position:0%
very much any other
questions

00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
see repr FL again uh thank you Mr
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
chairman I I again I apologize did you
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
represented your own Union you
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
established your own Union Yes um when
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
we initially founded it were we were the
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
fifth ever undergraduate Union it was
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
considered very
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
risky to take on students as a labor
 
00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:31.240 align:start position:0%
force and so we are an independently
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
formed Union we are Rank and file L we
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
teach ourselves contract law between
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
classes just a quick followup what's the
 
00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:40.039 align:start position:0%
name of your union the student worker

very very good work thank you so much
thank

00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
McCarthy morning uh my name is Larry
 
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
moochin I'm here on behalf of the over
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
200 uh uh 2,000 Union laborers who
 
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:13.720 align:start position:0%
reside in New Hampshire I'm also a
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
resident of Bo um one of the arguments
 
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
in favor of right to work is that uh
 
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
Union uh the employees should be able to
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
choose where they work without having to
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
join the union I would implore you to
 
00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
examine that argument a little more
 
00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
closely the question is why are the
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
employers that are unionized so
 
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
attractive uh to work for could it be
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
that the union that uh represents these
 
00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:41.720 align:start position:0%
uh workers so well and negotiates for
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
their interests
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
um that the members that work at these
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
places the pay and benefits are superior
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
to the competitor employees which may
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
not be
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
organized um secondly right to work is
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
really the endorsement of getting
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
something for nothing which is
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
essentially is welfare for employees who
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
earn the exact same thing as the person
 
00:58:09.309 --> 00:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
working next to them the only difference
 
00:58:11.789 --> 00:58:11.799 align:start position:0%
is that the person working next to them
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
is paying for their share of the
 
00:58:14.079 --> 00:58:15.470 align:start position:0%
is paying for their share of the
negotiated

00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
negotiated
 
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
contract uh from the services and the
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
benefits and working conditions and
 
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
wages that the union has provided for
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
them through
 
00:58:31.029 --> 00:58:31.039 align:start position:0%
negotiations and the concept of paying
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
dues for services is in benefits is not
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
a novel concept organizations that
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
support this legislation right here like
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
the ABC and the BR are Do's member uh
 
00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:45.710 align:start position:0%
the ABC and the BR are Do's member uh
based

00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
based
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
organizations it would be very
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
interesting to know if either would
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
provide their services to those who are
 
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
non-members even if those non-members
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
would like to get the benefit of those
 
00:59:01.549 --> 00:59:01.559 align:start position:0%
Services um the final question is what
 
00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
problem is this trying to solve here in
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we already have as low as
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
you can pay 725 minimum wage we have one
 
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:13.640 align:start position:0%
of the lowest unemployment rates in the
 
00:59:16.349 --> 00:59:16.359 align:start position:0%
country um and we have no prevailing
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
wages on construction projects already
 
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
this is all the things that right to
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
work did in other states um this leads
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
me to the inevitable conclusion that the
 
00:59:28.029 --> 00:59:28.039 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is for the
 
00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
government to infringe on the rights of
 
00:59:32.349 --> 00:59:32.359 align:start position:0%
two private entities trying to negotiate
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
a contract to provide goods and services
 
00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
for employees that they mutually agreed
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
on um that's my testimony I urge you to
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
please vote to recommend House Bill 238
 
00:59:46.029 --> 00:59:46.039 align:start position:0%
as inexpedient to
 
00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you for your testimony
 
00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:49.950 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you for your testimony
any

00:59:49.950 --> 00:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
questions seeing
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
none uh thank you sir I appreciate you
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
01:00:04.109 --> 01:00:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:13.640 align:start position:0%
Deck good morning Mr sorry U Mr chairman
 
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee I
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak here
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
today my name is Michael McCarthy I was
 
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
a for term state representative from
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
NASA a 26- year member of the IBEW labor
 
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
union and a 31-year member of the
 
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
Republican party to expand on what some
 
01:00:32.349 --> 01:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
other people said here today there are
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
consequences of right to work and I
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
think particularly when we're talking
 
01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
about something that you might not have
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
personal background in having been in a
 
01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:41.720 align:start position:0%
union I'd compare it to um instead of
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
Labor dues the fees one pays into a
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
homeowners association or into a condo
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
association now the reason people live
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
in these associations is because they
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
want someone to mow the lawn to remove
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
the snow to clean the pool to do
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
maintenance now some people choose not
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
to live in these places despite wanting
 
01:00:58.510 --> 01:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
these benefits because they don't want
 
01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:01.640 align:start position:0%
to pay them now if we were to pass a law
 
01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:03.640 align:start position:0%
that uh said that it was okay to live in
 
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
a condo association or homeowners
 
01:01:08.109 --> 01:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
association but get all the benefits and
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
pay nothing in those associations would
 
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
go bankrupt that is a consequence of
 
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
right to work as far as I'm concerned um
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
now strictly speaking as a republican
 
01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
it's a frustrating issue because it's
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
like Groundhog Day this issue keeps
 
01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
coming up over and over and over again
 
01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.390 align:start position:0%
coming up over and over and over again
um

01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
and uh is the Republican party has run
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire for the most
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
part since the Civil War and this is an
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
issue that has been coming up in this
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
state as I understand it since
 
01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
1947 that means time again over and over
 
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
again when this issue has been voted
 
01:01:46.349 --> 01:01:46.359 align:start position:0%
down it's been under a house that's been
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
controlled by Republicans under a senate
 
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
controlled by Republicans and under
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
Republican Governor so she didn't even
 
01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
become part of our party platform until
 
01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
2010 now during my time as a legislature
 
01:01:59.870 --> 01:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
we had uh fight this issue in two
 
01:02:02.829 --> 01:02:02.839 align:start position:0%
contentious times during the um 2010 and
 
01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
the 2016 session now sad to say we
 
01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
started out in a in a majority and
 
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
particularly the 2010 session it was a
 
01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
super majority now the after effects of
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
this of us pursuing this issue in an
 
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
illc conceived fashion was a much less
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
in uh spectacular minority position and
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
I just think people are expressing
 
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
themselves at The Ballot Box this issue
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
is not popular among the people of New
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I believe uh it's a
 
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
negative consequence for the people of
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire when Republicans aren't in
 
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
charge of the state that's my personal
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
perspective uh just to Simply wrap up um
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
since 1947 we've had a tremendous um
 
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
tradition of finding right to work and
 
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate in the state
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
state of Hampshire and I ask the
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
committee to please uphold this
 
01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
tradition and again find right toic and
 
01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate uh to move things
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
along no questions thank you all right
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%

testimony and I'd like to call B barudi

served on the affordable housing

01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
of the housing crisis and what's going
 
01:03:43.630 --> 01:03:43.640 align:start position:0%
on and now is not a good time for us to
 
01:03:46.269 --> 01:03:46.279 align:start position:0%
weaken our Workforce taking benefits
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
away from workers as a previous speaker
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
said um people want good solid workers
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
with benefits they can afford to pay
 
01:03:58.829 --> 01:03:58.839 align:start position:0%
rent and so for
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%

story before uh you've come before this
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%

you mentioned that nothing you could do
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
about how your union was being
 
01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
run uh it's my understanding that the
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
members run the union not the boss runs
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
the union but the members so isn't it
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
true that you could at
 
01:12:07.709 --> 01:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
Anytime work within your union to do
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
what you think was best for your union
 
01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
because you've said that you had no
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
control over
 
01:12:15.629 --> 01:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
that the problem there being and
 
01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
somebody has mentioned it uh you know
 
01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
the difference between a democracy in a
 
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
in a constitutional republic uh the in a
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
democracy and that's what unions are you
 
01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
know you've got 500 members and you've
 
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
got one guy with a complaint well 500
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
members rule okay uh in uh in this case
 
01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:37.719 align:start position:0%
that you can say you can resign from a
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
union if if this this bill passes you
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
can say no I've had enough of this
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
you're not serving me well I don't like
 
01:12:45.629 --> 01:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
your service I don't like your product
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay whether you and and if that's the
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
way you feel you don't have to pay you
 
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
know you don't have to be you don't have
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
to be a member okay and uh otherwise and
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
back back in 1974 I you know I I know we
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
had laws but those laws were being
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
broken I wish I had a copy of the
 
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
contract who it was mandated that you
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
join the union and I know people that
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
were were were let go you know we we had
 
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
a a thing where um we you had to work 96
 
01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
hours in in 30 days and um you know then
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
you then you had to join the union and I
 
01:13:19.629 --> 01:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
know people that will let go because
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to join the union you
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
know back in 1974 1975 in that time
 
01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:28.350 align:start position:0%
know back in 1974 1975 in that time
period

01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions representative
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
Sullivan you repeatedly say you had to
 
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
join the union yes are you fully aware
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
that it is illegal to force someone to
 
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
join a
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
union I am but in 1974 that's what they
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
were doing uh you know whether it was
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
illegal or not it was in that contract
 
01:13:49.629 --> 01:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
like I said I wish I had a c copy of
 
01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
that contract it was in there you know
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
must join power up yes sir um you also
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you were very
 
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
dissatisfied with uh your union rep yes
 
01:14:04.629 --> 01:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
I was a union rep for 25 years it was my
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
job to make sure the members were well
 
01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
taken care
 
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
of part of what motivated me was I
 
01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
didn't want to have a complaint go to my
 
01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
boss because my boss would have dealt
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
with that complaint and I would have
 
01:14:20.629 --> 01:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
been you know brought in the carpet I'm
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
proud to say it for 25 years that I had
 
01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:23.669 align:start position:0%
proud to say it for 25 years that I had
no

01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
complaints um
 
01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
and I was proud of the work I did but if
 
01:14:31.229 --> 01:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
there's somebody who's not doing their
 
01:14:31.239 --> 01:14:33.070 align:start position:0%
there's somebody who's not doing their
job

01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
um they ought to be um um have a
 
01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
complaint I ask you did you file a
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
complaint filing a complaint complaint
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
back in those days to get you
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
blackballed okay uh you you'd get no
 
01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
representation you'd uh you the first at
 
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
the first uh little bit of little bit of
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
okay yes sir um I I have a follow-up
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
question and I think it's important in
 
01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
the sense that
 
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
um try to figure out when people
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
withdraw from a union uh how this would
 
01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
work and okay I would like to know
 
01:15:17.149 --> 01:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
so the current situation is that
 
01:15:19.229 --> 01:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
everybody gets the same benefits whether
 
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
you a member of the union or not so if
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
you withdraw from the union you
 
01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
disconnect completely from the union now
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
I'm the employer so could you explain to
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
me how that would work if we had 50
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
different people uh you had the union
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
they had people that were just
 
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
Independents within that organization
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
how would that work and how would the
 
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
boss or the owner of that company manage
 
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
that kind of
 
01:15:44.430 --> 01:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
situation well I imagine they'd be able
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
to um you know hire fire pay better
 
01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
better benefits on on on on Merit if
 
01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
you've got a super employee you pay him
 
01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
if the guy's a slug well that has to be
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
reflective in in how he's uh how he's
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
too so you're you're saying that you
 
01:16:11.310 --> 01:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
would have individual agreements so
 
01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
you'd have the Union contract then you
 
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
would have individual agreements with
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
those people who wanted to be uh didn't
 
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
want to be part of the union and yes and
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
you is at your position that that would
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
promote labor peace within an
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
organization or would that be disruptive
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
to an
 
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
organization whether it promoted labor
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
peace or not uh it would promote labor
 
01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:35.550 align:start position:0%
peace or not uh it would promote labor
labor

01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%

01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of

the committee and happy New Year to you
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
all my name is Peggy Murphy McCarthy and
 
01:17:05.229 --> 01:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
I live in Nashua I am a member of ibw
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
local 2320 in Manchester a former member
 
01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire house and I'm a
 
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
republican my fellow Union Republicans
 
01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
and I have had a challenging time in New
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we've never understood the
 
01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
Republican disdain for unions aren't we
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
all about limiting government
 
01:17:23.229 --> 01:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
interference I took my job 28 years ago
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
specifically because it had a union
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
I benefit from good wages Health Care
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
retirement safe work rules paid medical
 
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
leave and pay Equity those are six major
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
labor issues that were negotiated not
 
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
legislated this bill attempts to insert
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
government into an existing functioning
 
01:17:46.189 --> 01:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
private Arrangement it suggests that
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
union workers are victims in need of
 
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
Rescue by the state worker freedom is
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
just a clever rebranding of the rhetoric
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
we heard in 2010 that this bill would
 
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
break the back of organized labor it's
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
been a tough 15 years for sure much to
 
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
our surprise in July president Trump
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
chose for his running mate a senator who
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
had walked a UAW picket line with his
 
01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
striking constituents and then in August
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire GOP chair announced an
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
effort to reach out to Union Republicans
 
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
stating that we and I quote were no
 
01:18:19.229 --> 01:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
longer the
 
01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
opposition after the election President
 
01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
Trump selected for his labor secretary
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
Lori Chavez deer a union endorsed
 
01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
Republican congresswoman who
 
01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored the proa that news got
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
everyone's attention president Trump's
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
slogan has been make America great again
 
01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
and I've seen many posts reflecting on
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
how previous generations could support a
 
01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
family own a home and retire on one
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
salary many of those grandparents I
 
01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
would submit to you were union members
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
in the mid1 1950s union membership was
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
at its peak at about 35% of the
 
01:18:54.270 --> 01:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
workforce and our economy was thriving
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
as the labor plank of the 1956
 
01:18:59.790 --> 01:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
Republican platform stated end I quote
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
the process of free collective
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
bargaining has been strengthened by the
 
01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
insistence of this Administration that
 
01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
labor and management settle their
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
differences at the bargaining table
 
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
without the intervention of the
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
government President Eisenhower was
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
quoted labor is the United States the
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
men and women who create the wealth that
 
01:19:20.910 --> 01:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
is shared in this country they are
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
America I truly hope the Outreach this
 
01:19:25.229 --> 01:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
summer was not in bad faith
 
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:26.960 align:start position:0%

this bill in expedient to legislate
 
01:19:51.149 --> 01:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:19:53.229 --> 01:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
representative Granger thank you Mr
 
01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:55.149 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
questions

01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
you suggest that right to work
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
represents government interference but
 
01:19:58.990 --> 01:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
what could be a greater interference
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
than the federal government stripping
 
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
away non members right to bargain for
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
themselves or to represent themselves in
 
01:20:03.679 --> 01:20:06.229 align:start position:0%
themselves or to represent themselves in
a

01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
grievance could you repeat that you
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
suggest that right to work represents
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
government interference but what could
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
be a greater interference than the
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
federal government stripping away
 
01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
non-members right to bargain for
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
themselves or to represent themselves in
 
01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.350 align:start position:0%
themselves or to represent themselves in
a

01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:20:22.510 --> 01:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
grievance I don't see that as government
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
interference if they're in an agreed
 
01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
upon arrangement to work in this office
 
01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
to work in this shop to work wherever
 
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
this work location is Under the Umbrella
 
01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
of their collective bargaining agreement
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
that if something comes up that they
 
01:20:37.149 --> 01:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
have a grievance they will be
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
represented by the union if they want to
 
01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
represent themselves they can work
 
01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.830 align:start position:0%
represent themselves they can work
someplace

01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
someplace
 
01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
else all right uh follow up keep it as
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
questions please do you think that the
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
federal government should be involved in
 
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
forcing people out of their job if they
 
01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
do not want to join a
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
union no no but that's not what this
 
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.270 align:start position:0%
union no no but that's not what this
is

01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%

Ian I live in conquered and I strongly
 
01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
support this bill this bill is one of
 
01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
Liberty and freedom and since New
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the Live Free or Die state
 
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
workers should have the freedom to
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
choose whether to Jo join a union or not
 
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
and never be subjected to agency fees
 
01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
now much of what I was going to discuss
 
01:22:07.629 --> 01:22:07.639 align:start position:0%
has already been mentioned um so I'm
 
01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
going to keep this brief um I've heard
 
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
that government should not be involved
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
in an organization which has the
 
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
blessings of government through the
 
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
national Relations Act of 1935 as
 
01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
representative Granger just pointed out
 
01:22:27.629 --> 01:22:27.639 align:start position:0%
unions are forced
 
01:22:30.189 --> 01:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
to provide collective bargaining for
 
01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
anybody that's in that particular job
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
first of all I don't see anything in the
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution that gave the government
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
the right to do this um so as far as I'm
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
concerned they the government created
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
the problem and unfortunately it'll be
 
01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
up to government to rectify the problem
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
by making right to
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
work now I've heard arguments that claim
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
that without Union
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
representation that chaos would ensue
 
01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
when it became time for worker
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
contracts in my younger days I was a
 
01:23:06.709 --> 01:23:06.719 align:start position:0%
police officer in the state of Texas
 
01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
which is a right to work
 
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
state there were never any problems with
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
negotiation whether it be with salary or
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
benefits employees and employers can
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
work together without labor unions
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
representation and it is the right and
 
01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
to me it's very insulting that a
 
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
government agency would think that I is
 
01:23:36.110 --> 01:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
am uncapable of negotiating for what I
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
need for myself and my family and as
 
01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
I've stated in Texas we did not have any
 
01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
problem um I I heard one representative
 
01:23:47.149 --> 01:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
say that uh there would be a lot of
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
different contracts this was not the
 
01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
case and it isn't today because as I
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
said Texas is still a right to work
 
01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:55.629 align:start position:0%
said Texas is still a right to work
state

01:23:55.629 --> 01:23:55.639 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:23:58.430 --> 01:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
so I implore you to pass this important
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you for your
 
01:24:03.390 --> 01:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Schulz thank
 
01:24:05.629 --> 01:24:05.639 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair quick question were you a
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
member of a union in Texas and are you a
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
member of a union currently um no Texas
 
01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
was is a well back then I don't know if
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
there was right to work or not but we
 
01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
were not a unionized police force in the
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
city of Marshall
 
01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
Texas and I was forced pay agency
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
fees when I was a teacher here in New
 
01:24:29.199 --> 01:24:30.830 align:start position:0%
fees when I was a teacher here in New
Hampshire

01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:33.400 align:start position:0%
um fortunately I was able to get a
 
01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
religious exemption but then when I they
 
01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
told me I would have to pay that $400
 
01:24:42.109 --> 01:24:42.119 align:start position:0%
$500 to a charity they wouldn't let me
 
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
pick a charity that I would use so again
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
I was being forced to do something that
 
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't have had to do with my own
 
01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.030 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't have had to do with my own
hard-earned

01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
hard-earned
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
money and luckily when the Janice
 
01:24:57.390 --> 01:24:57.400 align:start position:0%
decision came by I no longer had to
 
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
abide by that rule but unfortunately a
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
lot of people in the private sector will
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
still have to do this and as I said and
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to reiterate this again
 
01:25:09.550 --> 01:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
government created this problem in
 
01:25:12.669 --> 01:25:12.679 align:start position:0%
1935 and hopefully we can get rid of it
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire thank
 
01:25:17.229 --> 01:25:17.239 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie thank you Mr
 
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for appearing before
 
01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
the committee uh you were a union
 
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
teacher at one point is that your
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
testimony I was not a member of the
 
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
Union ever um but 10 years into my
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
teaching here in New Hampshire um they
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
decided that I had to pay the agency fee
 
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
and I was able to say no because of
 
01:25:42.030 --> 01:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
religious affiliations which I had to
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
prove and then they told me I couldn't
 
01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
give my money to a religious
 
01:25:48.669 --> 01:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
organization all I don't so the question
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
I have is for a followup sir sure as a
 
01:25:53.950 --> 01:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
non-union member m did you receive the
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
benefit benefits that were negotiated by
 
01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
the union and did you take those
 
01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
benefits that were negotiated by the
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
union to which you did not contribute to
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
the to the administration of that thing
 
01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
did you did you take all the benefits of
 
01:26:11.709 --> 01:26:11.719 align:start position:0%
course just like I did in Texas when I
 
01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
was not a member of a union thank you
 
01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:16.070 align:start position:0%
was not a member of a union thank you
representative

01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
farington thank you Mr chairman as a
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
non-member did the Union ever Advocate
 
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
against your own interest
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
yes by taking my money I'm a single
 
01:26:31.149 --> 01:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
parent and every scent
 
01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
counted okay repr stop thank you Mr
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
chair um did you ever consider going to
 
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
work for a nonpublic school during that
 
01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:46.280 align:start position:0%
time yes I did but as a single parent uh
 
01:26:48.669 --> 01:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
I considered going to the one of the
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
Catholic schools and um
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately since Vatican 2 came out
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's very hard to uh for teachers
 
01:26:59.830 --> 01:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
to have the same salary as public school
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
or private schools I see so the money
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
was better in the public school yeah it
 
01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
would have also been better in a private
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
school other than Catholic all right
 
01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
thank you all right represent bashard
 
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:19.119 align:start position:0%
question okay right to work allows
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
workers to benefit from Union
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
negotiations without paying dues
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
how can you assure me of the fairness of
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
some employees receiving the benefit of
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining for free While
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
others bear the cost okay as I've stated
 
01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government created this
 
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
problem and two wrongs don't make a
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
right it is up to this body for the
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire to tell the
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
federal government we're not doing that
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
and there's been a lot of federal laws
 
01:27:56.430 --> 01:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
that are not right are not
 
01:27:59.950 --> 01:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional and they need to be
 
01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
challenged okay representative kale
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
my question uh just to clarify do I did
 
01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
I hear correctly that the job you had as
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
a union teacher paid better wages and
 
01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:16.719 align:start position:0%
benefits than was available to you in a
 
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
non-union School in a Catholic school
 
01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
and that's where I am a Catholic and I
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
was I considered working there in
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
conquered because I am a single parent
 
01:28:29.709 --> 01:28:29.719 align:start position:0%
uh now I might have been able to go to
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
some private school somewhere else but
 
01:28:33.310 --> 01:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
then I would have had to travel been
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
away from my kids
 
01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
more for a followup so so it was better
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
in your situation as a single parent uh
 
01:28:45.629 --> 01:28:45.639 align:start position:0%
to stay working with the Union teaching
 
01:28:48.910 --> 01:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
job teaching in the school where I was
 
01:28:53.229 --> 01:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
yes but as I said it was wrong for the
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
law in 19 1935 to prevent me from
 
01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
negotiating okay so it's like a it's
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
like a catch 22 there one more small one
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
small B this is this is but again I'm
 
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
yes not
 
01:29:15.629 --> 01:29:15.639 align:start position:0%
interrogation right okay okay but again
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
because of the Union negotiated wages
 
01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:21.400 align:start position:0%
and benefits that you had even minus the
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
agency fee that I agree un you did did
 
01:29:27.629 --> 01:29:27.639 align:start position:0%
not like paying your your situation was
 
01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
was better than going
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
elsewhere I'm not going to say it was
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
because of the Union because there's a
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
lot of places where people work and they
 
01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:38.420 align:start position:0%
lot of places where people work and they
get

01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:38.430 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:39.550 align:start position:0%
get

benefits all right Ram Schultz Mr chair

I'd like to take a point of personal
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
privilege if it's okay and by that I
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%

01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:55.159 align:start position:0%

01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
right to work as does the pope as does
 
01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:00.600 align:start position:0%

with that group um uh I'm coming here to
 
01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
address this myth of um this worker
 
01:31:21.629 --> 01:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
who's out there and is stranded and has
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
no recourse because he she is in a union
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
um unions are democratic small D
 
01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
Democratic organizations they um they
 
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
run elections and if you're unhappy um
 
01:31:37.709 --> 01:31:37.719 align:start position:0%
you're in this Union you're unhappy with
 
01:31:39.310 --> 01:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
things let's you don't like the work
 
01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
rules you want Merit pay you want um uh
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
you want it you want it you the uh the
 
01:31:49.950 --> 01:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
business agent is drinking too much like
 
01:31:52.109 --> 01:31:52.119 align:start position:0%
someone said well what do you do you do
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
everything that you people have done
 
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
you run and you change things is it hard
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
yes right um you've got to convince
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
people you got to put your name out
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
there um I admire you guys whether I
 
01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
agree with you or not every two years
 
01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:09.400 align:start position:0%
you go you you work you know you you go
 
01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
and you run and you get elected because
 
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
you want to change things
 
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah right right well I think unions
 
01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
do a little better than $100 a year um
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
and uh yeah
 
01:32:27.390 --> 01:32:27.400 align:start position:0%
um that's that's really I I I never hear
 
01:32:30.109 --> 01:32:30.119 align:start position:0%
that point brought out enough that that
 
01:32:32.910 --> 01:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
you can change things um that I I work
 
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
for a union and I've done some
 
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
organizing um or organizing work on a on
 
01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
a renewal contract both of those had
 
01:32:44.109 --> 01:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
Merit pay so um I I and I think that's a
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
trend at least in the news Guild is to
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
have have Merit pay in in um in Union
 
01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
contracts so um any other questions any
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
question appreciate your testimony thank
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
you representative Granger thank you Mr
 
01:32:58.270 --> 01:32:58.280 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
question what would you say to the
 
01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
workers who do not wish to engage in
 
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
increased levels of workplace
 
01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
politics um you can you can you mean you
 
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
mean donating to political campaigns or
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
well you mentioned that or followup so
 
01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that
 
01:33:20.910 --> 01:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
um you can change things right through a
 
01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
similar through a similar method that we
 
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
use to get become representatives for
 
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
$100 a year yeah so what would you say
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
to those workers who do not want wish to
 
01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
have more workplace politics I I guess
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
then then whatever their concern is
 
01:33:39.109 --> 01:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
important I I think the analogy is I
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
live in Manchester but you know what and
 
01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
and I like and I get police coverage
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
fire coverage my roads are plowed um but
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
you know what I don't want to pay taxes
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
so I just won't vote and everything will
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
be fine that's just not how it works in
 
01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:58.790 align:start position:0%
be fine that's just not how it works in
this

01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
country for a
 
01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
followup would you consider union dues a
 
01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
tax uh yes and agency fees and agency
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
fees sure thank you very much yeah okay
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you sir for
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
your testimony I appreciate it thank you
 
01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:30.510 --> 01:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
Eden oh thank you very much Mr chairman
 
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for getting my name right
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
the second time I had a funny experience
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
in the Senate once which was uh the
 
01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
chair kept saying representative
 
01:34:39.709 --> 01:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
Harrington representative Harrington
 
01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
who's another rep from stford County and
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
I thought it I was looking around for
 
01:34:44.669 --> 01:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
Michael Harrington and she realized I
 
01:34:45.870 --> 01:34:45.880 align:start position:0%
thought I'd written my name clearly
 
01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
enough but I apparently I didn't but I
 
01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
apologize so I'm resident Timothy Horgan
 
01:34:54.750 --> 01:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
h o r r i g- n and um I'm from straford
 
01:34:57.790 --> 01:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
County District 10 the town of Durham
 
01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:58.750 align:start position:0%
County District 10 the town of Durham
and

01:34:58.750 --> 01:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
um the phrase right to work is
 
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
misleading obviously work is a privilege
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
not a right I mean everybody deserves
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to work but nobody's
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
entitled to any particular job with any
 
01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:09.310 align:start position:0%
entitled to any particular job with any
particular

01:35:09.310 --> 01:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
employer and um every employer does have
 
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
the right to set the terms of the
 
01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
employment and if you want to work for
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
that employer you need to meet those
 
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
terms and some employers have chosen to
 
01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
be Union shops and
 
01:35:25.629 --> 01:35:25.639 align:start position:0%
um and obviously that usually doesn't
 
01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
happen 100% voluntarily they usually
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
unionize only if the workers get
 
01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
together to organize a union which is
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
pretty difficult but every employer has
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
the right to get by with non-union labor
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
to move their existing facilities
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
somewhere else including to North
 
01:35:41.950 --> 01:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
Carolina or overseas or even the shut
 
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
down altogether so I'm in my ninth term
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
now I've been getting letters snail mail
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
letters delivered by unionized postal
 
01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
workers from New England write to work
 
01:35:51.390 --> 01:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
for over 15 years now and I haven't
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
saved all those letters I do have that
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
20 and 20 2013 letters and they both say
 
01:35:58.270 --> 01:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
exactly the same thing as as a 2025
 
01:35:59.910 --> 01:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
letter and one of their talking points
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
is repeated reference to a report by PHS
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
fantas the nation's longtime leading
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
business relocation firm and um that
 
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
firm actually hasn't existed for 20
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
years and it's I have good reason to
 
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
believe that that report doesn't in fact
 
01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
does not actually exist and if they did
 
01:36:20.109 --> 01:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
they were a consulting firm that was
 
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
selling a particular version to business
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
climate and one of the things
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
and what they thought was a good
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
business climate was a non-union
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
Workforce but that's uh that's just that
 
01:36:33.149 --> 01:36:33.159 align:start position:0%
was just their opinion and ironically
 
01:36:34.590 --> 01:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
they don't exist anymore because they
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
got bought up by a large company which
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
sold them to another large company and
 
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
that's something I'm sure the workers of
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
that company lost their jobs in that
 
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
process and so about 2005 it disappeared
 
01:36:47.229 --> 01:36:47.239 align:start position:0%
all together but
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh so you have my written
 
01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
testimony which you've seen twice cuz I
 
01:36:54.149 --> 01:36:54.159 align:start position:0%
handed out copies and put it on the
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
portal but anyway unions and I'm still
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
lifting a phrase here from Mark from
 
01:37:00.030 --> 01:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
Mark Hayward just testified they're
 
01:37:01.950 --> 01:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
small D Democratic
 
01:37:03.870 --> 01:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
institutions they're not perfect but
 
01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
they're more democratic than many other
 
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
institutions so any union members
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
dissatisfied with the Union's
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
performance is this free to work with
 
01:37:14.669 --> 01:37:14.679 align:start position:0%
the Union committee they're also um free
 
01:37:17.310 --> 01:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
to go somewhere else um they're if the
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
pay rates working diss are better
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere else they can go somewhere
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
else but
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
usually fact almost always those pay
 
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
rates and working conditions are better
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
when the workers can collectively
 
01:37:30.510 --> 01:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
negotiate through the union and if some
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
worker doesn't want anything at all to
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
do with unions just about every
 
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
profession has a choice of non-union
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
shops and representative your time is up
 
01:37:40.189 --> 01:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
all right thank you are there any
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
questions sure thanks see no question
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
it I'd like to call Tom Eden
 
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
colb hello chair and representatives
 
01:38:05.589 --> 01:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
good morning sir my name is Tom Eaton
 
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
I'm a lifelong New Hampshire resident
 
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
and proud ibw member I'm here
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
representing myself I testified my
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
opposition to the right to work Senate
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 516 on March 19th 2024 I focused on
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
the statistics obain obtained by
 
01:38:23.550 --> 01:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
Vermont's 2024 proposition 3 the
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
proposition passed the Vermont House and
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
Senate Senate
 
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
unanimously this sent a strong message
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
to Vermont's middle class their elected
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
officials support them and not corporate
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
lobbyists pushing a Washington DC agenda
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
on in our region there are still no
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
right to work states in New England to
 
01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
date and we should keep it that way we
 
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
are here today to oppose Right to Work
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 238 Right to Work always has
 
01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
been and always will be be wrong for New
 
01:38:56.669 --> 01:38:56.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there is nothing about right
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
to work that makes our state a better
 
01:39:00.910 --> 01:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
place to work or live the effects of
 
01:39:03.310 --> 01:39:03.320 align:start position:0%
Right to Work are quite the opposite in
 
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
states where it has been voted in right
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
to work is not beneficial to workers its
 
01:39:09.629 --> 01:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
only purpose is to weaken unions from
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
within by financial distress the name
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
right to work is quite deceiving no
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
labor unions wish unemployment for
 
01:39:19.629 --> 01:39:19.639 align:start position:0%
workers we feel the exact opposite we
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
want the safest best workplaces and
 
01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:23.790 align:start position:0%
want the safest best workplaces and
practices

01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
practices
 
01:39:25.229 --> 01:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
achieve union jobs are more attractive
 
01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
to workers because of the compensation
 
01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
benefits and retirement that are
 
01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
collectively bargained for unions are
 
01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
voted into shops and workplaces under
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
nlrb guidelines and procedures by a
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
majority vote of the employees if
 
01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
someone does not wish to work at a union
 
01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
shop they are free to work at a
 
01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
non-union shop that performs the same
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
job I compel you all to think who this
 
01:39:55.870 --> 01:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
legislation serves it does not benefit
 
01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire it intends
 
01:40:00.669 --> 01:40:00.679 align:start position:0%
to diminish our quality of life for the
 
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
profit of others please help send the
 
01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719 align:start position:0%
message to New Hampshire voters that our
 
01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
elected officials support our middle
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%

you to support House Bill 238 the New

Hampshire Right to Work bill of course a
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
number of other people are going to be
 
01:40:57.390 --> 01:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
talking about the economic arguments in
 
01:40:59.229 --> 01:40:59.239 align:start position:0%
favor of right to work which are very
 
01:41:01.950 --> 01:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
real um the fact is over the last decade
 
01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
right to work states saw 16% job growth
 
01:41:07.149 --> 01:41:07.159 align:start position:0%
while New Hampshire lagged behind at 5 a
 
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
half% uh Kentucky in 2017 pass right to
 
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
work in January went into effect
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
immediately and they added 100,000 jobs
 
01:41:17.550 --> 01:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
saw $9.2 billion in investment from in
 
01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
in new projects their previous high was
 
01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
5.5 billion um the you know Oklahoma
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
went from 40th in job growth the first
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
almost immediately and stayed in the top
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
five over the next decade Indiana dozens
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
of projects in the pipeline within eight
 
01:41:34.189 --> 01:41:34.199 align:start position:0%
months of right to work you know you it
 
01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
works um West Virginia lost jobs in the
 
01:41:38.430 --> 01:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
six years leading up to right to work
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
6,000 jobs if I remember right added
 
01:41:42.270 --> 01:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
22,000 in the three years after it
 
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
passed it and they recovered from you
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
the losses for covid way faster than Mo
 
01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
most other states um the reason for this
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
is something like half of all states
 
01:41:55.070 --> 01:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
considering relocation or expansion uh
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
automatically rule out non-right to work
 
01:41:58.669 --> 01:41:58.679 align:start position:0%
states but you know the ranger of my
 
01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
time I'd just like to talk a little
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
about you some of the arguments you're
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
likely to hear um yeah as you know tens
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
of thousands of workers in New Hampshire
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
presently have no choice you know if
 
01:42:09.589 --> 01:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
they're you they're forced to pay union
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
dues or not have a job and Common Sense
 
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
tells us that no private organization
 
01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:15.639 align:start position:0%
should be able to take away a worker's
 
01:42:17.790 --> 01:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
livelihood for refusal to bankroll that
 
01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
organization and and Common Sense also
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
tells us freedom is two-sided that's why
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment bars Congress from
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
prohibiting religious observance and
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
also bars Congress from forcing anyone
 
01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
to worship um same principle should
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
apply in labor law freedom to associate
 
01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
is meaningless without you know Freedom
 
01:42:36.510 --> 01:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
not to associate yet Right to Work
 
01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:38.360 align:start position:0%
opponents claim a worker who wants to
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
join Union somehow isn't truly free
 
01:42:43.629 --> 01:42:43.639 align:start position:0%
unless all his co-workers pay up um you
 
01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
there are several rationalizations for
 
01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
this the first is that they're forced to
 
01:42:49.629 --> 01:42:49.639 align:start position:0%
pay you know represent non-members as
 
01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
several people have said that's just not
 
01:42:52.589 --> 01:42:52.599 align:start position:0%
true in the private in the private
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
sector quote William g Who was appointed
 
01:42:56.709 --> 01:42:56.719 align:start position:0%
by Bill Clinton to serve as chairman of
 
01:42:59.589 --> 01:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
the nlrb um in his book agenda reform he
 
01:43:01.149 --> 01:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
said the law permits members only
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
bargaining without regard to majority
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
rule or an appropriate unit without
 
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
regard to exclusivity the fact is you
 
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
know exclusive representation is the
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
something the union bosses demand not
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
something that is foisted on them second
 
01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
rationalization is on this false
 
01:43:17.229 --> 01:43:17.239 align:start position:0%
assumption that working that that
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
workers you know all workers benefit I
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
mean it's a simple example here in New
 
01:43:23.189 --> 01:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was in 2009 the state of
 
01:43:24.750 --> 01:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
employees Association refused to
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
negotiate fur law lows and as a result
 
01:43:29.229 --> 01:43:29.239 align:start position:0%
250 workers who were then forced to pay
 
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
union dues at the time lost their jobs
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
you know those workers lost their jobs
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
as a direct result of the Union's
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
negotiating strategy please tell me how
 
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
those workers benefit from Union
 
01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
membership indeed then California
 
01:43:43.870 --> 01:43:43.880 align:start position:0%
attorney general okay I'm up I'll
 
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%

01:43:53.709 --> 01:43:53.719 align:start position:0%
Roger representative St
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
please um you gave us a lot of data can
 
01:43:59.550 --> 01:43:59.560 align:start position:0%
I ask where that data came from and can

you provide it to us uh yes I can um
 
01:44:06.510 --> 01:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
with with regards to the specifics uh
 
01:44:08.109 --> 01:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
most of it comes from just Federal you
 
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
know employment data combined with uh we
 
01:44:13.589 --> 01:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
typ we typically use uh The Merck uh
 
01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
cost of living dat you know uh index but
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%

representative

01:44:21.629 --> 01:44:21.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
Flanagan thank you Mr Mr chairman you
 
01:44:27.149 --> 01:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
had mentioned West Virginia MH and I
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
think all of us received an email of a
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
video that Governor Justice put out
 
01:44:34.669 --> 01:44:34.679 align:start position:0%
saying that they enacted right to work
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
and no one was beating down his door to
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
bring their businesses to West Virginia
 
01:44:39.790 --> 01:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm just
 
01:44:42.589 --> 01:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
wondering how does that the data that
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
you had saying they had Monumental
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
growth uh compared to what he testified
 
01:44:50.709 --> 01:44:50.719 align:start position:0%
or stated in a state of the uh the state
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
address I would imagine that's what it
 
01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
was um so so representative Flanigan I I
 
01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
know that you've probably seen a
 
01:44:59.070 --> 01:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
dishonest attack ad in politics once or
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
twice in your life um yeah it it people
 
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
in this room have seen them a lot um
 
01:45:07.470 --> 01:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
probably about them uh in any event um
 
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
you know before he said that Governor
 
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
Justice made it clear he supported right
 
01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
to work and he cautioned against
 
01:45:13.589 --> 01:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
twisting his words I mean the fact is
 
01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.719 align:start position:0%
what he was saying in context Is that
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
West Virginia hadn't done enough I mean
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
in 2019 Justice came out and said that
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
yeah right to work was a reason why they
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
were adding jobs but after Co I mean
 
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
look you know uh he he's a guy who wants
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
the state to be better um and you know
 
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
that and so yeah he's looking to do more
 
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
to advocate for a state understandable
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
but anyway you have another question
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
okay just for a followup it the video
 
01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
was of him yes is I mean I don't know
 
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
how you could put words in his mouth
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
when it comes out of his mouth that he
 
01:45:48.350 --> 01:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
was doing a state but anyway got thank
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:54.990 --> 01:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
yeah um representative labry and then
 
01:45:57.149 --> 01:45:57.159 align:start position:0%
represent Schultz thank you Mr chair
 
01:45:58.950 --> 01:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh the
 
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
North country is economically challenged
 
01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
and what do you think that this law ped
 
01:46:06.910 --> 01:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
would do to that North Country near and
 
01:46:09.790 --> 01:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
dear to my heart is a Berlin guy um yeah
 
01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
I think it would help I mean it would
 
01:46:13.470 --> 01:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
get you know so a right to work you know
 
01:46:15.149 --> 01:46:15.159 align:start position:0%
what what the what the old Fanta study
 
01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
says and what most of these other
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
studies say is that it's a primary
 
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
selection criteria for half of companies
 
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
so they're not even looking at non-right
 
01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
to work states it's kind of of like if
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
you're looking for real estate and you
 
01:46:26.589 --> 01:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
need a house you know you're only
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
looking at houses with a garage or
 
01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
something and you know your right to
 
01:46:32.189 --> 01:46:32.199 align:start position:0%
work is kind of like a free garage I
 
01:46:33.790 --> 01:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
mean unlike a lot of other Economic
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
Development things I mean um you know a
 
01:46:38.709 --> 01:46:38.719 align:start position:0%
company that insists on an interstate
 
01:46:40.109 --> 01:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
highway coming to their town is not
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
going to cons consider Berlin but it is
 
01:46:44.589 --> 01:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
going to get them more looks and it'll
 
01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
and it'll help them get it'll help them
 
01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully close out a few jobs and get
 
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
some real Prosperity up
 
01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
there follow uh for a followup
 
01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
um I guess not only in my opinion but in
 
01:46:59.629 --> 01:46:59.639 align:start position:0%
the opinion of a lot of folks there's a
 
01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
lot of union jobs in the North Country
 
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's uh prisons systems or or
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
whatnot um and it still remains
 
01:47:09.669 --> 01:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
depressed how do you square that so
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
you're asking me why there are a lot
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of union jobs and why
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
the area is depressed look a lot of
 
01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:15.639 align:start position:0%
companies have moved out I mean and and
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
they never got replaced I mean Berlin
 
01:47:19.149 --> 01:47:19.159 align:start position:0%
had a population over 20,000 in the
 
01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
1920s and it's down I think 9,000 right
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
now um
 
01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
you know it's just you know the package
 
01:47:27.310 --> 01:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
of you know you know you logging has
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
move you know has gotten smaller and
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
paper mills and um they just really
 
01:47:32.669 --> 01:47:32.679 align:start position:0%
hasn't been you know they they sold the
 
01:47:34.830 --> 01:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
prisons as a way of you know bringing
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
other employment but you know it it just
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
hasn't been enough and I'd like to see
 
01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
more come into the North Country thank
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
you okay and repres Schultz thank you Mr
 
01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
chair I should have held this question
 
01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
for you given your affiliation um why do
 
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
you think the national
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
GOP uh platform under Donald Trump
 
01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
removed the right to work um plank so
 
01:48:00.109 --> 01:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of things they took out
 
01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:01.679 align:start position:0%
of the platform I mean if you look at
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
the 2024 platform it's a much simpler
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
sort of overall overarching statement of
 
01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
principles rather than a a bill of
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
specifics and they just you know they
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
took a you number of issues unrelated to
 
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
right to work out of the platform it's
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
just it's a much simpler document you
 
01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
know you have less words you say
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
less okay and represent McKenzie sir and
 
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative Sol on De uh you had a
 
01:48:29.589 --> 01:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
lot to say during the course of this
 
01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
testimony and it's very difficult to
 
01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
unpack it uh but let me say one thing uh
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
that the North Country for many many
 
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
years was wall to wall unions up there
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
and it was a failure of uh and the
 
01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
economy changed and the the Mills closed
 
01:48:50.030 --> 01:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
but that that aside this particular bill
 
01:48:54.669 --> 01:48:54.679 align:start position:0%
as I as I read it has two Visions in it
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
one is uh relates to becoming uh a
 
01:48:59.390 --> 01:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
remain a union
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
member uh which currently is a
 
01:49:03.550 --> 01:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the of the federal
 
01:49:06.510 --> 01:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
government so this has no real impact
 
01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
that people currently can can join a
 
01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
union or not join a union they can come
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
to work in a in a there's no such thing
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
as a union shop anymore but they can
 
01:49:20.709 --> 01:49:20.719 align:start position:0%
come to work in any business in the
 
01:49:23.109 --> 01:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
state of no Hampshire union or non-union
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
and do not have to currently uh uh
 
01:49:28.189 --> 01:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
they're not prohibited from doing that
 
01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
do we agree on that that that is one
 
01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
provision of this well you misspoke sir
 
01:49:36.189 --> 01:49:36.199 align:start position:0%
the union shop is not prohibited but the
 
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
the closed shop is prohibited but yeah
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
um but yeah and the problem is that
 
01:49:41.629 --> 01:49:41.639 align:start position:0%
workers are still being forced to pay a
 
01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
union as a condition of employment and
 
01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
we consider that wrong so Mr chairman is
 
01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
that's the point of this this
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
legislation there's a lot of other stuff
 
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
included in it but it comes down to that
 
01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
second section that's number two which
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
basically says it's about paying union
 
01:50:00.990 --> 01:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
dues it's about paying agency fees
 
01:50:02.910 --> 01:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
correct because it's not going to change
 
01:50:05.229 --> 01:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of people's access to to
 
01:50:06.669 --> 01:50:06.679 align:start position:0%
employment well I do think it's
 
01:50:08.229 --> 01:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
important to reiterate a worker's right
 
01:50:10.189 --> 01:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
to join a union if they so choose you
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
know I think that's important
 
01:50:13.950 --> 01:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
philosophically but yeah no I I mean but
 
01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
yeah obviously you know the teeth of the
 
01:50:18.669 --> 01:50:18.679 align:start position:0%
bill or forcing is that it eliminates
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
the practice of forcing workers to join
 
01:50:21.390 --> 01:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
or support a
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
union okay and representative Sullivan
 
01:50:26.589 --> 01:50:26.599 align:start position:0%
sir representative McKenzie did a good
 
01:50:28.709 --> 01:50:28.719 align:start position:0%
job of taking my
 
01:50:31.149 --> 01:50:31.159 align:start position:0%
thunder okay representative
 
01:50:33.390 --> 01:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
rer uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question is a non-union
 
01:50:38.189 --> 01:50:38.199 align:start position:0%
member who is forced to pay union dues
 
01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:42.679 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote in the union no thank
 
01:50:45.629 --> 01:50:45.639 align:start position:0%
you and representative Susi and then
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative ler thank you Mr chairman
 
01:50:50.109 --> 01:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
so I see you wearing the orange badge do
 
01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
you represent you represent right to
 
01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
work yes I'm an employee of the national
 
01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
Right to Work committee do you receive a
 
01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
fee or a paycheck to do that yeah I'm
 
01:51:02.830 --> 01:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
I'm an employe okay so my question would
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
be you're representing the national
 
01:51:08.149 --> 01:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
right to work and you charge them a fee
 
01:51:10.109 --> 01:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
you get a paycheck why should unions
 
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
have to represent people and not get
 
01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
paid to do it as well they've demanded
 
01:51:17.870 --> 01:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
that power under federal law I I mean
 
01:51:19.470 --> 01:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
this isn't something foed on them it's
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
something they've demanded that's a
 
01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
clear difference
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
okay and representative lerk thank you
 
01:51:29.069 --> 01:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I would have to agree with
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
you that 80% of the people that live in
 
01:51:35.709 --> 01:51:35.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire support people's ability
 
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
of to have the right to
 
01:51:40.510 --> 01:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
work do you believe that they understand
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
the legislation and would agree with it
 
01:51:45.629 --> 01:51:45.639 align:start position:0%
if they knew really what it
 
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
was basically a union
 
01:51:52.030 --> 01:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
busting bill it's a simple bill it
 
01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
really is just giving workers freedom to
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
choose whether or not they believe a
 
01:51:58.069 --> 01:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
labor union you know benefits them yeah
 
01:51:59.870 --> 01:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's about personal
 
01:52:02.069 --> 01:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
freedom just quick followup for a
 
01:52:05.229 --> 01:52:05.239 align:start position:0%
followup please yeah I just I just don't
 
01:52:09.669 --> 01:52:09.679 align:start position:0%
think that most people really understand
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
what this bill does and what it's trying
 
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
to do so I I kind of would have to
 
01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
disagree with what here okay so we can
 
01:52:17.390 --> 01:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
ask questions yeah so the question is do
 
01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
you really believe that people
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
understand what this Bill is saying and
 
01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
that it really affects them in any way
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
shape or form I I believe they
 
01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
understand it and I believe that it does
 
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
affect look a you know Rising tide lifts
 
01:52:34.109 --> 01:52:34.119 align:start position:0%
all boats you know if you got more jobs
 
01:52:35.709 --> 01:52:35.719 align:start position:0%
coming into the state by definition
 
01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's going to mean those are better
 
01:52:38.910 --> 01:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
jobs because if people come in and offer
 
01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
employment they're not going to get any
 
01:52:41.790 --> 01:52:41.800 align:start position:0%
takers unless they're offering better
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
than what people already
 
01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
have okay and representative farington
 
01:52:49.149 --> 01:52:49.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman we've heard a lot
 
01:52:52.270 --> 01:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
about this legislation weakening unions
 
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
is is Union participation higher in
 
01:52:56.669 --> 01:52:56.679 align:start position:0%
right to work states or non-right to
 
01:52:56.679 --> 01:52:58.229 align:start position:0%
right to work states or non-right to
work

01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:53:01.069 --> 01:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
states it varies a good bit uh in
 
01:53:04.709 --> 01:53:04.719 align:start position:0%
particular I I from memory Alabama and
 
01:53:06.270 --> 01:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
uh Nevada have higher Union
 
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
participation rates uh Wisconsin I think
 
01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
too uh than New Hampshire um I mean
 
01:53:13.229 --> 01:53:13.239 align:start position:0%
overall by and large forced unionism
 
01:53:15.790 --> 01:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
states have higher Union density but is
 
01:53:17.629 --> 01:53:17.639 align:start position:0%
that correlation or
 
01:53:19.790 --> 01:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
causation okay and representative
 
01:53:22.510 --> 01:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
Granger thank you Mr chair why would
 
01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
unions demand the right to represent
 
01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
non-members uh they get a lot of power
 
01:53:29.189 --> 01:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the fact that they they
 
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
have control over all the workers and
 
01:53:32.790 --> 01:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
and there's no competition I mean if if
 
01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
you had workers able to I mean like look
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
as a manager it's pretty easy to
 
01:53:38.229 --> 01:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
negotiate pay for multiple people I mean
 
01:53:40.990 --> 01:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
I manage a couple people and it's not a
 
01:53:44.830 --> 01:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
big time suck for me um you know but but
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
really I I mean you know if you actually
 
01:53:48.189 --> 01:53:48.199 align:start position:0%
started seeing workers paid better I
 
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
mean there was a case out in uh Nebraska
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
a good long time ago but uh School Board
 
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't find a teacher to teach shop
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
class uh for you know they had to offer
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
$5,000 more money because there simply
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
were no qualified people to actually
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
teach the thing um you know and the Nea
 
01:54:04.830 --> 01:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
took them to court saying no you're
 
01:54:06.149 --> 01:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
paying them more you know that's
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
unacceptable and the their lawyer uh
 
01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
told the Omaha World Herald that that
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
was a victory for collective bargaining
 
01:54:12.669 --> 01:54:12.679 align:start position:0%
when when that failed I mean that's one
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
of the very few cases that actually came
 
01:54:16.990 --> 01:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
out but um you know there's this sort of
 
01:54:19.470 --> 01:54:19.480 align:start position:0%
idea that you know yeah I mean it allows
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
them to present the fiction that like
 
01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
everyone's benefiting because it's
 
01:54:23.550 --> 01:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
everyone get the same deal that that
 
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
example okay so we can ask questions for
 
01:54:32.910 --> 01:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
a long time and the longer we ask
 
01:54:35.069 --> 01:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
questions the longer we go so if it is a
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
Germain question that is going to help
 
01:54:41.229 --> 01:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
our understanding of HB 238 please ask a
 
01:54:43.149 --> 01:54:43.159 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair do you
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
consider it a hostage
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
scenario uh yeah no I mean they're not
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%

mentioned Oklahoma as a right to work
 
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
state were they an early adopter or just
 
01:55:10.990 --> 01:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
recent uh they were
 
01:55:13.870 --> 01:55:13.880 align:start position:0%
2001 2001
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
yes interesting uh followup for a
 
01:55:20.229 --> 01:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
followup yes well I I was reading that
 
01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
in the 90s they were trying to attract
 
01:55:25.510 --> 01:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
United Airlines and they sent they sent
 
01:55:27.589 --> 01:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
people to live to go and visit Oklahoma
 
01:55:30.510 --> 01:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
City for a week and the they came back
 
01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
and they said they didn't want to live
 
01:55:34.390 --> 01:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
there nothing against Oklahoma City
 
01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
myself but it wasn't until they enacted
 
01:55:39.310 --> 01:55:39.320 align:start position:0%
a 1% sales tax and started investing in
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
the in the in the town that they were
 
01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
attracting businesses and in fact
 
01:55:45.069 --> 01:55:45.079 align:start position:0%
they're going to have an Olympic event
 
01:55:47.709 --> 01:55:47.719 align:start position:0%
some 2,000 miles away from the Summer
 
01:55:50.589 --> 01:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
Olympics is should we enact a 1% sales
 
01:55:52.709 --> 01:55:52.719 align:start position:0%
tax in New Hampshire do we draw relate
 
01:55:57.550 --> 01:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
to HB 238 sir I vaguely I give you
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
exceptionally vely I see see yeah okay
 
01:56:02.470 --> 01:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
all right and representative clerk yeah
 
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
thanks again Mr chair so do you
 
01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
understand that the Union's wages are a
 
01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
minimum wage for their
 
01:56:13.470 --> 01:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
employees uh yeah I guess in a sense
 
01:56:16.510 --> 01:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay just a quick followup please
 
01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:18.430 align:start position:0%
yeah okay just a quick followup please
please

01:56:18.430 --> 01:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
um as long as are you aware that as long
 
01:56:24.430 --> 01:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
as they get the minimum their minimum
 
01:56:26.589 --> 01:56:26.599 align:start position:0%
wage they can actually get
 
01:56:30.510 --> 01:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
more so if I just as an example I'm a
 
01:56:34.270 --> 01:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
union carpenter if I I make X I can
 
01:56:36.430 --> 01:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
negotiate for more as you know by being
 
01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:37.069 align:start position:0%
negotiate for more as you know by being
a

01:56:37.069 --> 01:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:56:41.069 --> 01:56:41.079 align:start position:0%
foreman producing more um and and a
 
01:56:42.589 --> 01:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
company that I work for can give me
 
01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
benefits and higher pay if they so
 
01:56:46.109 --> 01:56:46.119 align:start position:0%
choose as long as I get at least the
 
01:56:49.629 --> 01:56:49.639 align:start position:0%
minimum are you aware of that um so
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of weird things in the
 
01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
construction industry uh that's that's
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
not typical of a lot of unionized
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
employment but yeah I me I mean
 
01:56:58.629 --> 01:56:58.639 align:start position:0%
obviously if you move into a if you're a
 
01:57:00.270 --> 01:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
teacher if you get your master's degree
 
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
but it's it's set by the terms of the
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
contract were you aware of that I could
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
do that though uh no there's as I said
 
01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of weird things in the
 
01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:09.069 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of weird things in the
construction

01:57:09.069 --> 01:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
construction
 
01:57:13.390 --> 01:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
industry okay one last look around we're
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%

the electrical contractors Association
 
01:58:02.589 --> 01:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
representing um electrical construction
 
01:58:04.350 --> 01:58:04.360 align:start position:0%
companies so that's the employers the
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
business owners both small and large
 
01:58:08.229 --> 01:58:08.239 align:start position:0%

and Maine um some of the ibw members
 
01:58:18.189 --> 01:58:18.199 align:start position:0%
that are employed by my employers are um
 
01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire but maybe
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
members of other local unions um
 
01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the region so I am here today
 
01:58:29.629 --> 01:58:29.639 align:start position:0%
to testify in opposition to House Bill
 
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
238 um also known as right to work as I
 
01:58:35.470 --> 01:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned NAA we our contractors are
 
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
responsible electrical and
 
01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:38.229 align:start position:0%
responsible electrical and
telecommunication

01:58:38.229 --> 01:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
telecommunication
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
contractors um and what we do is we
 
01:58:43.229 --> 01:58:43.239 align:start position:0%
advance the industry through advocacy
 
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
education research and standards
 
01:58:47.950 --> 01:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
development and we are only able to
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
accomplish this as an employer
 
01:58:51.629 --> 01:58:51.639 align:start position:0%
organization in conjunction with our
 
01:58:53.709 --> 01:58:53.719 align:start position:0%
partner ship with the ibw the
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
International Brotherhood of Electrical
 
01:58:58.470 --> 01:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
Workers our partnership with the ibw
 
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
allows us to perform work with special
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge and experience needed for
 
01:59:03.510 --> 01:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
every kind of project that you can
 
01:59:06.069 --> 01:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
imagine it allows us to reduce accidents
 
01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
and injuries and in turn reduce costly
 
01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
delays on projects our partnership with
 
01:59:13.790 --> 01:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
the ibw allows us to eliminate call
 
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
backs limit change orders helps to avoid
 
01:59:19.229 --> 01:59:19.239 align:start position:0%
emergencies that can bust budgets on
 
01:59:21.189 --> 01:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
these construction projects and
 
01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
incidents that turn into legal issues
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
when a contractor calls the hiring Hall
 
01:59:27.189 --> 01:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
ibw they know that they're going to get
 
01:59:31.709 --> 01:59:31.719 align:start position:0%
someone who is trained and
 
01:59:34.510 --> 01:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable in short this partnership
 
01:59:36.589 --> 01:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
guarantees that our contractors get a
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
job when we get a job it will be staffed
 
01:59:41.069 --> 01:59:41.079 align:start position:0%
by the highly skilled workers who
 
01:59:43.709 --> 01:59:43.719 align:start position:0%
complete this on time many times under
 
01:59:46.270 --> 01:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
budget and that work is performed on
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
that job is the highest
 
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%

02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Janice Kelby and
 
02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
I'm a retired postal worker I worked a
 
02:07:59.390 --> 02:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
midnight shift in a mail processing
 
02:08:04.069 --> 02:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
plant at the USPS for over 29 years I
 
02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
currently live in hooks at New Hampshire
 
02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
I was a single parent when I was hired
 
02:08:11.229 --> 02:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
and very aware that the benefits that
 
02:08:13.589 --> 02:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
made me want to seek a job at the post
 
02:08:16.510 --> 02:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
office had been obtained through the
 
02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
union and their
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
negotiations it is more evident with the
 
02:08:23.589 --> 02:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
Postal Service than it is a lot of
 
02:08:26.910 --> 02:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
places because the postal service has a
 
02:08:30.310 --> 02:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
category of employees called casuals
 
02:08:32.629 --> 02:08:32.639 align:start position:0%
casuals weren't necessarily shortterm
 
02:08:34.990 --> 02:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
some had worked for more than 10 years
 
02:08:36.549 --> 02:08:36.559 align:start position:0%
they were not part of the bargaining
 
02:08:40.149 --> 02:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
unit and the that made the difference
 
02:08:42.910 --> 02:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
between what the Postal Service gave you
 
02:08:44.589 --> 02:08:44.599 align:start position:0%
out of the kindness of their heart and
 
02:08:46.990 --> 02:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
what had been attained by the union very
 
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
clear casuals wages were far less than
 
02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
ours although they often did identical
 
02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
work they got no sick leave no health
 
02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
benefits earned minimal time off paid
 
02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
time off and no retirement benefits
 
02:09:04.669 --> 02:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
folks were not knocking down the doors
 
02:09:07.109 --> 02:09:07.119 align:start position:0%
to become a casual they wanted the
 
02:09:11.310 --> 02:09:11.320 align:start position:0%
career jobs they wanted them complete
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
with all the benefits negotiated by the
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
union so workers who are telling you
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
they want nothing to do with the Union
 
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
are not being 100% honest they do want
 
02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
want the benefits that were achieved by
 
02:09:26.189 --> 02:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
the union and the benefits do not just
 
02:09:29.430 --> 02:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
simply fall out of the sky sadly working
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
for the USPS is somewhat like being in a
 
02:09:35.069 --> 02:09:35.079 align:start position:0%
right to work state people who choose
 
02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
not to join a union don't share the cost
 
02:09:39.990 --> 02:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
of representation most postal workers
 
02:09:43.030 --> 02:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
join a union but not all having some
 
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
people enjoy the contract benefits
 
02:09:47.709 --> 02:09:47.719 align:start position:0%
without helping with the cost does in
 
02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
fact create Division and resentment do
 
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
Union is obligated by federal law to
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
represent the non-members who pay
 
02:09:59.229 --> 02:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
nothing not even for their own personal
 
02:10:03.030 --> 02:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
representation I know in my local we um
 
02:10:07.229 --> 02:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
had to defend a guy who was not a union
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
member and the fees for the arbitrator
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
for just one day and this was 20 years
 
02:10:14.350 --> 02:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
ago was
 
02:10:17.390 --> 02:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
$1,500 just for a one day hearing that
 
02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
came out of my dues not his the bigger
 
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
issue is the considerable resources that
 
02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
go in to negotiating a contract I went
 
02:10:29.069 --> 02:10:29.079 align:start position:0%
to a national arbitration case to
 
02:10:32.589 --> 02:10:32.599 align:start position:0%
testify one time about the job duties of
 
02:10:36.069 --> 02:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
a particular job and I listened first to
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
The Economist talk and several other
 
02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
expert Witnesses those people were paid
 
02:10:46.549 --> 02:10:46.559 align:start position:0%
to be there by the union and that's what
 
02:10:50.950 --> 02:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
made us get an increase in the wages for
 
02:10:54.030 --> 02:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
that particular job that wouldn't happen
 
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
without that I just have one question if
 
02:10:57.480 --> 02:10:58.950 align:start position:0%
without that I just have one question if
there's

02:10:58.950 --> 02:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:11:01.430 --> 02:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
people thank you for your testimony
 
02:11:05.709 --> 02:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:08.229 --> 02:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no question I'm sorry
 
02:11:10.549 --> 02:11:10.559 align:start position:0%
representative St or Schultz thank you
 
02:11:14.109 --> 02:11:14.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I would would love to hear
 
02:11:15.910 --> 02:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
your question and I don't know it's of
 
02:11:19.629 --> 02:11:19.639 align:start position:0%
us as a committee or my my question is
 
02:11:22.270 --> 02:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
why if there are all these businesses
 
02:11:24.669 --> 02:11:24.679 align:start position:0%
are going to flock to New Hampshire if
 
02:11:26.149 --> 02:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
we get right to
 
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
work didn't anybody tell them that right
 
02:11:33.990 --> 02:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
to work or that a agency fee is not a
 
02:11:36.589 --> 02:11:36.599 align:start position:0%
requirement they don't have to negotiate
 
02:11:40.669 --> 02:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
it so that's nothing but baloney that
 
02:11:42.350 --> 02:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to flock here to New
 
02:11:44.709 --> 02:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they could flock here now and
 
02:11:47.189 --> 02:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
say no I don't want a fair share
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
Clause thank you ma'am are there any
 
02:11:52.669 --> 02:11:52.679 align:start position:0%

Howard thank you Mr chairman and hello
 
02:12:11.549 --> 02:12:11.559 align:start position:0%
to my fellow labor committee members
 
02:12:14.430 --> 02:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
sorry that I'm not with you this year uh
 
02:12:17.189 --> 02:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm ré representative ré
 
02:12:19.750 --> 02:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
kulum from Hillsboro District
 
02:12:22.549 --> 02:12:22.559 align:start position:0%
30 heard from one of the previous uh
 
02:12:25.109 --> 02:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
speakers that those people who work for
 
02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
non-union companies um don't prosper
 
02:12:29.589 --> 02:12:29.599 align:start position:0%
from it and that the only person who
 
02:12:32.030 --> 02:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
walks away with the gold is the
 
02:12:35.470 --> 02:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
owner I'd like to share my story uh I
 
02:12:37.589 --> 02:12:37.599 align:start position:0%
started working for a commercial heating
 
02:12:39.910 --> 02:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
and air conditioning company back in
 
02:12:43.030 --> 02:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
1993 and my position was an entry-level
 
02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
position over the course of my 25 years
 
02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
there I retired as a vice president and
 
02:12:50.549 --> 02:12:50.559 align:start position:0%
general manager running an operation of
 
02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
with a six million actually more than $6
 
02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:53.470 align:start position:0%
with a six million actually more than $6
million

02:12:53.470 --> 02:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:12:56.310 --> 02:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
budget uh we were non-union and I
 
02:12:58.229 --> 02:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
believe that I advocated pretty well for
 
02:13:01.870 --> 02:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
myself and that the owner of the company
 
02:13:03.470 --> 02:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
was not the only one who walked away
 
02:13:05.549 --> 02:13:05.559 align:start position:0%
with the gold that many of us had the
 
02:13:07.870 --> 02:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to advance ourselves in that
 
02:13:10.270 --> 02:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
company and advocate well for ourselves
 
02:13:11.830 --> 02:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
and they worked with us to help reach
 
02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:13.629 align:start position:0%
and they worked with us to help reach
our

02:13:13.629 --> 02:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:13:15.709 --> 02:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
goals so one of the things I'd like to
 
02:13:18.510 --> 02:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
share is over the 25 years that I was
 
02:13:22.350 --> 02:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
there um when I started we had 125
 
02:13:24.549 --> 02:13:24.559 align:start position:0%
employees over the 25 years we grewed
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
over 400
 
02:13:28.549 --> 02:13:28.559 align:start position:0%
employees throughout the course of that
 
02:13:31.390 --> 02:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
time we had the trade unions um coming
 
02:13:33.669 --> 02:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
in they would send in their employees
 
02:13:36.030 --> 02:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
and they tried multiple times to to
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
organize our our um company they were
 
02:13:42.790 --> 02:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
tireless at it we were successful every
 
02:13:45.149 --> 02:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
time and um we believe it was because we
 
02:13:47.790 --> 02:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
offered great benefits great wages we
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
had a strong focus on safety we had
 
02:13:51.870 --> 02:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
continual training
 
02:13:53.390 --> 02:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
we had a robust health and dental
 
02:13:55.589 --> 02:13:55.599 align:start position:0%
insurance plan which you hear to today
 
02:13:59.390 --> 02:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't exist with non-union
 
02:14:02.669 --> 02:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
companies so the you know as a non-union
 
02:14:04.589 --> 02:14:04.599 align:start position:0%
company we also did a lot of government
 
02:14:06.510 --> 02:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
work between the state and with the
 
02:14:08.990 --> 02:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
federal agencies and we were required to
 
02:14:10.709 --> 02:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
pay the prevailing rates which was the
 
02:14:12.350 --> 02:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
union scale wages that we were hearing
 
02:14:15.229 --> 02:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
about today and having been a person who
 
02:14:17.430 --> 02:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
did the certified payroll I could see
 
02:14:20.589 --> 02:14:20.599 align:start position:0%
that we almost always paid higher than
 
02:14:23.229 --> 02:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
the Union scale Rate rates and we didn't
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
have the adjustments that we could take
 
02:14:26.990 --> 02:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
off and deduct from those union scale
 
02:14:28.790 --> 02:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
rates that the union had so they had an
 
02:14:31.229 --> 02:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
advantage over us on the competition for
 
02:14:33.950 --> 02:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
um winning these jobs bidding on these
 
02:14:36.069 --> 02:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
jobs but we were still successful in
 
02:14:37.990 --> 02:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
keeping ourselves in the
 
02:14:40.270 --> 02:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
market so we hear about the policies
 
02:14:42.549 --> 02:14:42.559 align:start position:0%
that don't create jobs um or improve
 
02:14:45.310 --> 02:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
economic outcomes again I'll say that we
 
02:14:48.350 --> 02:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
grew to over 400 employees so we created
 
02:14:53.470 --> 02:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:54.990 --> 02:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
I believe that had the union been
 
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
successful in organizing us that the
 
02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
those employees um who wanted to remain
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
as non-union should have had that right
 
02:15:04.709 --> 02:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
they started off with a company that was
 
02:15:06.910 --> 02:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
non-union it was the Union sending in
 
02:15:09.549 --> 02:15:09.559 align:start position:0%
their employees to try to organize us so
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
they should have had that right to stay

that fully company funded
 
02:15:54.030 --> 02:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting question um I did
 
02:15:54.870 --> 02:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
have to
 
02:15:57.430 --> 02:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
contribute and um my employees all of
 
02:15:59.189 --> 02:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
the employees had to contribute I it was
 
02:16:02.069 --> 02:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
a 8020 split the company picked up 80%
 
02:16:04.030 --> 02:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
we paid 20 and I had a woman who was
 
02:16:06.229 --> 02:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
working for me who didn't join who
 
02:16:08.189 --> 02:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
didn't sign on for the benefits and what
 
02:16:09.709 --> 02:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
she told me was her husband was a
 
02:16:12.669 --> 02:16:12.679 align:start position:0%
carpenter um union carpenter worker and
 
02:16:14.990 --> 02:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
he had to buy the insurance benefits and
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
he didn't have the option to opt out so
 
02:16:19.390 --> 02:16:19.400 align:start position:0%
he was paying over $300 a week for his
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
insurance benefits that she could have
 
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
bought for $60 a week through our
 
02:16:26.549 --> 02:16:26.559 align:start position:0%
organization can I can I follow up with
 
02:16:30.750 --> 02:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
that for follow up Sir um just as so you
 
02:16:33.110 --> 02:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
know we don't pay for our health
 
02:16:36.309 --> 02:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
insurance our people that we work for
 
02:16:38.750 --> 02:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's in the contract as part of our
 
02:16:42.509 --> 02:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
contract that it the uh companies that
 
02:16:45.110 --> 02:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
we work for pay for our health insurance
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
I should clarify this was this was in
 
02:16:50.110 --> 02:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
New York so it may be different there I
 
02:16:51.589 --> 02:16:51.599 align:start position:0%
I do not know I'm just saying in New
 
02:16:53.790 --> 02:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire nothing comes out of my check
 
02:16:56.110 --> 02:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
for my health insurance the insurances
 
02:16:58.190 --> 02:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
were equal as far as their coverage they
 
02:17:01.709 --> 02:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
were very comparable yep good I'm again
 
02:17:03.790 --> 02:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
I I happy for you that everything was
 
02:17:06.030 --> 02:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
great and represent
 
02:17:08.549 --> 02:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
stab thank you uh thank you for taking
 
02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
my question it's good to see you um my
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
question is if your company had not been
 
02:17:18.030 --> 02:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
so good to its employees do you think
 
02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%
the union might have had more success in
 
02:17:25.230 --> 02:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:27.469 --> 02:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
workplace hard to say I mean it's
 
02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
possible Right but they knew they knew
 
02:17:33.389 --> 02:17:33.399 align:start position:0%
we were treating our employees well and
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
what the benefits were for them it was
 
02:17:38.790 --> 02:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
strictly a membership financial gain for
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
them to come in and get our employees
 
02:17:42.549 --> 02:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
into their
 
02:17:46.910 --> 02:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
Union okay um no further questions I'd
 
02:17:49.469 --> 02:17:49.479 align:start position:0%

Hokinson thank you honorable Mr chair
 
02:18:28.509 --> 02:18:28.519 align:start position:0%
and uh committee members my name is
 
02:18:30.190 --> 02:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
representative Heath Howard I represent
 
02:18:31.629 --> 02:18:31.639 align:start position:0%
the towns of straford and barington in
 
02:18:33.990 --> 02:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
straford District 4 I'm the son of a
 
02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%
union member in the Rochester school
 
02:18:38.030 --> 02:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
district and have seen how unions work
 
02:18:39.790 --> 02:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
firsthand because they're not just
 
02:18:42.389 --> 02:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
organizations but communities when I was
 
02:18:44.910 --> 02:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
16 years old I broke my back and my mom
 
02:18:46.669 --> 02:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
used all of her sick days and all of her
 
02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
vacation days to be with me the thing is
 
02:18:51.030 --> 02:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
is that fellow teachers and Union
 
02:18:53.870 --> 02:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
members made us meals gave us gas cards
 
02:18:56.589 --> 02:18:56.599 align:start position:0%
and even visited Us in the hospital the
 
02:18:58.150 --> 02:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
union was there for my family when we
 
02:19:01.709 --> 02:19:01.719 align:start position:0%
needed it most HB 238 is a bill that
 
02:19:03.509 --> 02:19:03.519 align:start position:0%
would destroy the ability for labor
 
02:19:05.070 --> 02:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
unions to organize and undermine the
 
02:19:07.150 --> 02:19:07.160 align:start position:0%
very agreement of how they can function
 
02:19:08.990 --> 02:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
effectively I want to give a little
 
02:19:10.270 --> 02:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
background to the committee about the
 
02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
formation and dissolution of labor
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
unions they are formed by holding an
 
02:19:16.910 --> 02:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
election and can be dissolved by holding
 
02:19:19.389 --> 02:19:19.399 align:start position:0%
an election just like this past November
 
02:19:20.709 --> 02:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
when Donald Trump became president
 
02:19:22.349 --> 02:19:22.359 align:start position:0%
presid of the United States or in 2020
 
02:19:24.629 --> 02:19:24.639 align:start position:0%
when Joe Biden did we are all subject to
 
02:19:26.589 --> 02:19:26.599 align:start position:0%
the same laws and taxes implemented by
 
02:19:29.509 --> 02:19:29.519 align:start position:0%
them workplaces operate just like any
 
02:19:31.709 --> 02:19:31.719 align:start position:0%
other state and whether you like paying
 
02:19:33.629 --> 02:19:33.639 align:start position:0%
taxes or dues they fund important
 
02:19:35.469 --> 02:19:35.479 align:start position:0%
infrastructure essential to benefiting
 
02:19:38.230 --> 02:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
the masses I'll end my analogy Now by
 
02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
making a stark contrast between the
 
02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
government and unions unions are widely
 
02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
trusted and unite people of all
 
02:19:47.870 --> 02:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
political parties why because they
 
02:19:49.990 --> 02:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
consistently produce results for workers
 
02:19:52.750 --> 02:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
in the form of better contracts pay or
 
02:19:55.150 --> 02:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
benefits passing this legislation would
 
02:19:56.590 --> 02:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
create the opportunity for people to
 
02:19:58.790 --> 02:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
freeload off of a union by benefiting
 
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
from everything that the dues pay for
 
02:20:03.309 --> 02:20:03.319 align:start position:0%
without contributing it is an All or
 
02:20:06.190 --> 02:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
Nothing Game and demand the same
 
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
benefits uh and and if an employer uh
 
02:20:13.510 --> 02:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
were to deny uh sorry I apologize this
 
02:20:14.910 --> 02:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
so-called white right to work
 
02:20:16.950 --> 02:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
circumvents the whole election process
 
02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
making it pointless and it turns in turn
 
02:20:22.750 --> 02:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
tramples the right of others if people
 
02:20:24.910 --> 02:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
want to stop working in a union
 
02:20:27.710 --> 02:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
workplace they can vote on it simply put
 
02:20:29.630 --> 02:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
right to work is wrong for New Hampshire
 
02:20:33.309 --> 02:20:33.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh are there any questions of this
 
02:20:38.950 --> 02:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
witness seeing no questions thank you
 
02:20:41.429 --> 02:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
and do you have your written testimony
 
02:20:42.990 --> 02:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh I can forward it to the committee if
 
02:20:44.510 --> 02:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
you could put it that in representative
 
02:20:46.830 --> 02:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
C if you have yours um that would be
 
02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:49.349 align:start position:0%
C if you have yours um that would be
fine

opposition to HB 238 FN so-called Right

to Work bill as you
 
02:22:37.830 --> 02:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
know uh for almost 20 years and I think
 
02:22:39.710 --> 02:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
it's as we've heard today much longer
 
02:22:42.750 --> 02:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
than that uh years efforts to pass this
 
02:22:45.790 --> 02:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
legislation have been defeated by bar
 
02:22:48.070 --> 02:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
bipartisan groups of legislators who
 
02:22:50.190 --> 02:22:50.200 align:start position:0%
voted down these bills because they knew
 
02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
right to work is bad for New Hampshire
 
02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
workers taxpayers and businesses as
 
02:22:57.510 --> 02:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
business owners we believe that right to
 
02:23:00.309 --> 02:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
work is bad public policy because it
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
mandates government interference in a
 
02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
free market and will adversely impact
 
02:23:08.110 --> 02:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire based businesses if
 
02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
passed by this legislation right to work
 
02:23:13.590 --> 02:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
will intrude on our business's ability
 
02:23:15.750 --> 02:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
to freely negotiate contracts that we
 
02:23:17.469 --> 02:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
determine are in the best interest of
 
02:23:20.269 --> 02:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
our companies this is not a decision
 
02:23:22.150 --> 02:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
that State should be making especially
 
02:23:24.550 --> 02:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire this legislation
 
02:23:26.349 --> 02:23:26.359 align:start position:0%
will also adversely impact our
 
02:23:29.389 --> 02:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
businesses because it harms the unions

to our companies by weakening unions and
 
02:24:00.990 --> 02:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
our training programs right to work will
 
02:24:03.230 --> 02:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
make it harder for us to find trained

employees in New Hampshire that will
 
02:24:09.670 --> 02:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
economy we also believe that passing
 
02:24:13.710 --> 02:24:13.720 align:start position:0%
right to work will harm our communities
 
02:24:16.030 --> 02:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
because studies are shown oh I'm the

02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
taking the time to hear me out uh I just
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
want to say I'm kind of G to wing it a
 
02:26:06.870 --> 02:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
little bit I had something written up
 
02:26:08.710 --> 02:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
but after hearing all the testimony I
 
02:26:11.349 --> 02:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
kind of see that a lot of you really
 
02:26:12.910 --> 02:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
understand more so what this bill is
 
02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
about than the previous year when I was
 
02:26:18.230 --> 02:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
here um which which is good to see um
 
02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
I'm representing Gen X Construction
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
and save on wall construction here I'm a
 
02:26:24.510 --> 02:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
project manager for them we do anywhere
 
02:26:26.750 --> 02:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
from 50 to $75 million worth of
 
02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
construction work a year um we oppose
 
02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
this we think that it's not good for New
 
02:26:37.150 --> 02:26:37.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we are I heard somebody
 
02:26:39.269 --> 02:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
mention something about it being
 
02:26:42.429 --> 02:26:42.439 align:start position:0%
compared to a hostage hostage situation
 
02:26:44.110 --> 02:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
as far as being a union member me myself
 
02:26:46.910 --> 02:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
I am a union member as well um I'm
 
02:26:48.389 --> 02:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
actually a union member who was just
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with cancer in the past two
 
02:26:54.590 --> 02:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
months and because I'm a union member
 
02:26:55.950 --> 02:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
the one thing I didn't have to worry
 
02:26:57.870 --> 02:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
about throughout all this is how I was
 
02:27:00.429 --> 02:27:00.439 align:start position:0%
going to P to pay for it my family's
 
02:27:03.030 --> 02:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
taken care of my medical is covered all
 
02:27:04.389 --> 02:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
I've got to do is focus on getting
 
02:27:07.230 --> 02:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
better and I can do that because the
 
02:27:10.870 --> 02:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
union helps me I work non-union for 20
 
02:27:13.630 --> 02:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
years in this industry I didn't have
 
02:27:16.309 --> 02:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
anything that I have like I do now
 
02:27:17.790 --> 02:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
Union I don't have to pay my dues
 
02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
I have the right to go work anywhere I
 
02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
want I do it by choice every member does
 
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
it by choice no one's forced to do
 
02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
anything um I think that's the part that
 
02:27:34.030 --> 02:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
really people don't understand with this
 
02:27:35.950 --> 02:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
no one's forced to do
 
02:27:38.309 --> 02:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
this um and the fact that it keeps
 
02:27:40.429 --> 02:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
coming up and we got to keep talking
 
02:27:42.230 --> 02:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
about it even though it get shot down
 
02:27:45.429 --> 02:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
repeatedly I understand that that's how
 
02:27:48.670 --> 02:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
legislation Works um I think there's
 
02:27:50.190 --> 02:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
better things our tax dollars can be
 
02:27:52.870 --> 02:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
going for then talking about this
 
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
situation consistently that keeps
 
02:27:55.550 --> 02:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
getting shot
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
down um the education's great as an from
 
02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
an employer standpoint the people that
 
02:28:06.030 --> 02:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
we get from the Carpenters Union they're
 
02:28:08.630 --> 02:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
educated they're safe they're not going
 
02:28:09.990 --> 02:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
to hurt themselves when they go to work
 
02:28:11.469 --> 02:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
we're confident in that we don't have to
 
02:28:12.830 --> 02:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
worry about having to call someone's
 
02:28:15.190 --> 02:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
family and say Hey Joe fell off the
 
02:28:16.389 --> 02:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
staging he's not going to be home
 
02:28:18.670 --> 02:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
tonight Joe was trained how to walk on
 
02:28:19.750 --> 02:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
that staging to make sure that he's
 
02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
going to be safe and get home to his
 
02:28:23.670 --> 02:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
family you don't really get that
 
02:28:25.830 --> 02:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
anywhere else without having to pay out
 
02:28:27.710 --> 02:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
of pocket the Carpenters Union does that
 
02:28:30.630 --> 02:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
for us so for the measly 20 something
 
02:28:33.630 --> 02:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
dollars we pay in dues a month my return
 
02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
on investment is tfold do it I do it
 
02:28:39.670 --> 02:28:39.680 align:start position:0%

02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
have to say I appreciate your testimony
 
02:28:45.230 --> 02:28:45.240 align:start position:0%

questions seeing no questions thank you
 
02:28:54.830 --> 02:28:54.840 align:start position:0%

afternoon Mr chair and members of the
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Stephan consalvas
 
02:29:10.510 --> 02:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
I'm here for myself my family and my
 
02:29:13.309 --> 02:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
union I've uh worked for the United
 
02:29:15.110 --> 02:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
Steel Workers and lived in Salem New
 
02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for over 20 25 years I raised
 
02:29:20.349 --> 02:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
three children two of which are adult
 
02:29:24.150 --> 02:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
now in New Hampshire um my middle my
 
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
middle daughter when she was three years
 
02:29:28.590 --> 02:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
old was diagnosed with
 
02:29:32.110 --> 02:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
histiocytosis it's it's a disease that
 
02:29:34.750 --> 02:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
basically it ate her ate her bones in
 
02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
her ear um in
 
02:29:41.950 --> 02:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
over probably 20 surgeries
 
02:29:44.950 --> 02:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy uh now years later it's
 
02:29:47.389 --> 02:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
considered a cancer but because of my
 
02:29:51.630 --> 02:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
union in my Union Insurance
 
02:29:54.469 --> 02:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
and everything that my union did for me
 
02:29:57.429 --> 02:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
I didn't pay one cent out of my pocket
 
02:29:59.510 --> 02:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
for the hundreds and hundreds of
 
02:30:02.389 --> 02:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars of medical bills
 
02:30:07.230 --> 02:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
that we had um my question is why and
 
02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
when why do we continue to try to pass
 
02:30:13.230 --> 02:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
this so-called right to work in a state
 
02:30:15.870 --> 02:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
where we don't want it or need it when
 
02:30:18.309 --> 02:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
is this going to stop I have been here
 
02:30:20.469 --> 02:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
for every every time this is come up in
 
02:30:22.750 --> 02:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
the last 20 something
 
02:30:25.309 --> 02:30:25.319 align:start position:0%
years we will never stop fighting this
 
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
because it is wrong for New
 
02:30:30.630 --> 02:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have Janice we have other
 
02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
workers ability not to join Union so why
 
02:30:36.630 --> 02:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
our private businesses don't want it
 
02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
this is not nor do our workers so why
 
02:30:43.389 --> 02:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
influences from other states come here
 
02:30:45.830 --> 02:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
handing out donations and the promise of
 
02:30:47.469 --> 02:30:47.479 align:start position:0%
something that just isn't
 
02:30:50.269 --> 02:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
true our state is growing for the better
 
02:30:52.830 --> 02:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
and we don't need any so-called help
 
02:30:55.389 --> 02:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
from right to work do we want to grow or
 
02:30:57.429 --> 02:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
do we want to go backwards because the
 
02:31:00.150 --> 02:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
truth is right to work states although I
 
02:31:02.230 --> 02:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
heard how happy they are I don't know
 
02:31:04.309 --> 02:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
how you're happy being
 
02:31:07.990 --> 02:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
poorer worse medical and worse schools
 
02:31:11.670 --> 02:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
than anywhere else in the country so
 
02:31:14.349 --> 02:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
what I want to leave for my children is
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
not that please vote no on HB 238 the
 
02:31:21.910 --> 02:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is better than
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
this thank you sir appreciate your
 
02:31:27.110 --> 02:31:27.120 align:start position:0%

02:31:29.429 --> 02:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no questions thank you
 
02:31:33.750 --> 02:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:36.349 --> 02:31:36.359 align:start position:0%

02:31:50.030 --> 02:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
Deck good morning good morning Mr
 
02:31:51.790 --> 02:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee my
 
02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
name is Mark atarian I'm the lead
 
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.160 align:start position:0%

02:32:01.070 --> 02:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my wife and I live in New
 
02:32:02.950 --> 02:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the my wife and I have
 
02:32:05.110 --> 02:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
lived in New Hampshire for the last 22
 
02:32:07.710 --> 02:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
years and we have two adult children who
 
02:32:10.429 --> 02:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
work and live in our great
 
02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
state I'm here today because I believe
 
02:32:15.710 --> 02:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
that our citizens deserve to know the
 
02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
truth about HB 238 FN
 
02:32:22.150 --> 02:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
the right to work in the phrase right to
 
02:32:24.670 --> 02:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
work itself is intended to deceive and
 
02:32:27.190 --> 02:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
confuse working Americans about the
 
02:32:29.990 --> 02:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
impact such laws will have on their
 
02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.230 align:start position:0%
impact such laws will have on their
working

02:32:32.230 --> 02:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:32:34.670 --> 02:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
conditions as Martin Luther King Jr
 
02:32:35.870 --> 02:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
pointed out in
 
02:32:38.910 --> 02:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
1961 right to work is a false
 
02:32:41.870 --> 02:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
slogan since right to work laws provide
 
02:32:45.070 --> 02:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
neither rights nor work and in fact are
 
02:32:48.190 --> 02:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
designed to Rob us of our civil rights
 
02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
and job rights
 
02:32:52.910 --> 02:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
right to work is also design designed to
 
02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
destroy labor unions and the freedom of
 
02:32:57.510 --> 02:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining by which the
 
02:33:00.389 --> 02:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
unions have improved wages working
 
02:33:02.269 --> 02:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
conditions for
 
02:33:04.990 --> 02:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
everyone decades later research proves
 
02:33:07.630 --> 02:33:07.640 align:start position:0%
King's contention that wherever these
 
02:33:11.230 --> 02:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
laws have been passed wages are
 
02:33:14.110 --> 02:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
lower no New England state has a right
 
02:33:16.750 --> 02:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
to work law and repeated
 
02:33:20.230 --> 02:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
defeats repeated defeats to fight uh
 
02:33:22.349 --> 02:33:22.359 align:start position:0%
work bills have demonstrated its
 
02:33:25.030 --> 02:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
persistent unpopularity among the
 
02:33:29.830 --> 02:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rers and with legisl from both
 
02:33:32.550 --> 02:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
parties the north atlan States cist
 
02:33:34.389 --> 02:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
training fund invests more than $13
 
02:33:36.190 --> 02:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
million in our apprentiship and
 
02:33:39.870 --> 02:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
journeyman training programs across our

region at on the Hampshire Training
 
02:33:44.750 --> 02:33:44.760 align:start position:0%

no cost to the

taxpayers these training programs
 
02:33:58.030 --> 02:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
provide more than our more than 100 New
 
02:34:00.190 --> 02:34:00.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire based Union contractors with
 
02:34:03.150 --> 02:34:03.160 align:start position:0%
highly skilled safe and reliable
 
02:34:05.349 --> 02:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
Workforce that allows them to be
 
02:34:09.110 --> 02:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
successful in a competitive construction
 
02:34:11.349 --> 02:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
industry the passage of right to work
 
02:34:13.790 --> 02:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
law would negatively impact our apprenti
 
02:34:15.950 --> 02:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
program by potentially weakening the
 
02:34:18.150 --> 02:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
bargaining powers of
 
02:34:20.950 --> 02:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
unions which plays a significant role in
 
02:34:24.230 --> 02:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
managing and promoting apprenticeship
 
02:34:26.870 --> 02:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
programs potentially leading to fewer
 
02:34:29.469 --> 02:34:29.479 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship opportunities lower
 
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
quality training
 
02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
standards and less stability and
 
02:34:38.309 --> 02:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity for our apprentices to do uh
 
02:34:40.230 --> 02:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
to reduce Union
 
02:34:43.150 --> 02:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
protections unions particularly the
 
02:34:45.750 --> 02:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
building trade unions actively negotiate
 
02:34:47.349 --> 02:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
for apprenticeship programs with
 
02:34:49.990 --> 02:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements
 
02:34:51.750 --> 02:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
ensuring quality standards and
 
02:34:54.070 --> 02:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
commitment from employers to train
 
02:34:57.510 --> 02:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
apprentices in the workforce of
 
02:34:59.910 --> 02:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
tomorrow with right to work laws where
 
02:35:01.990 --> 02:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
workers are not required to contribute
 
02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
to the cost of their
 
02:35:07.870 --> 02:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
representation this leverage would be
 
02:35:09.750 --> 02:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
diminished thank you sir I appreciate

students do you have currently um
 
02:36:09.550 --> 02:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
working in that building um you also
 
02:36:12.870 --> 02:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
have apprentices but how big is the
 
02:36:16.510 --> 02:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
program well the program is is quite big
 
02:36:20.070 --> 02:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
um on any on any given week we have 25
 
02:36:22.990 --> 02:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
to 30 students uh being trained in our
 
02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
facility uh in various aspects of what
 
02:36:28.349 --> 02:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
we do as far as commercial work it could
 
02:36:30.630 --> 02:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
be finished work it could be doors and
 
02:36:33.550 --> 02:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
hardware um and every week it changes
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
but on an average 25 to 30 apprentices a
 
02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
week we
 
02:36:41.030 --> 02:36:41.040 align:start position:0%

that's that's a rotating so people who
 
02:36:49.030 --> 02:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
are in the apprenticeship program um get
 
02:36:50.630 --> 02:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
trained and then they're working out in

thank you for your patience and for
 
02:38:47.630 --> 02:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
listening and being here my name is Gail
 
02:38:50.150 --> 02:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
Kenny I reside in Kanan New Hampshire
 
02:38:51.950 --> 02:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
I'm a pastor with the Meridan
 
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
Congregational Church and I also speak
 
02:38:56.910 --> 02:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the economic Justice
 
02:38:59.070 --> 02:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
Ministry of the New Hampshire United
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
Church of Christ which is the largest
 
02:39:04.030 --> 02:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
Protestant denomination of the state and
 
02:39:06.030 --> 02:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
I'm also here on behalf of other clergy
 
02:39:08.710 --> 02:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
as well so numerous New Hampshire Faith
 
02:39:10.750 --> 02:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
leaders from multiple Traditions
 
02:39:13.269 --> 02:39:13.279 align:start position:0%
Catholic Protestant Jewish and others
 
02:39:15.389 --> 02:39:15.399 align:start position:0%
have been vigorous in their opposition
 
02:39:19.150 --> 02:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
to to deceptively labeled um a right to
 
02:39:20.990 --> 02:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
work work bills in New Hampshire
 
02:39:23.150 --> 02:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
whenever they have been introduced Faith
 
02:39:25.630 --> 02:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
leaders have been here saying no this is
 
02:39:27.469 --> 02:39:27.479 align:start position:0%
not right for New Hampshire and I
 
02:39:29.550 --> 02:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
believe that the Catholic dasis of New
 
02:39:31.230 --> 02:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has already submitted their
 
02:39:35.590 --> 02:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
own very strong testimony opposing on HB
 
02:39:38.429 --> 02:39:38.439 align:start position:0%
238 so our multiple Faith Traditions
 
02:39:40.590 --> 02:39:40.600 align:start position:0%
lead us to understand that workers
 
02:39:42.870 --> 02:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
deserve to have a voice on the job and
 
02:39:45.230 --> 02:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
the right to come together collectively
 
02:39:47.309 --> 02:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
we also believe that New Hampshire
 
02:39:50.349 --> 02:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
employers have the right to NE negotiate
 
02:39:52.349 --> 02:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
with their workers without the heavy
 
02:39:55.150 --> 02:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
hand of the legislature interfering with
 
02:39:57.870 --> 02:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
this very specific their contractual
 
02:40:00.910 --> 02:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
provisions and this bill is nothing more
 
02:40:03.469 --> 02:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
than that heavy hand so whether you're
 
02:40:05.230 --> 02:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
religious or not uh you've probably
 
02:40:07.110 --> 02:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
heard of The Ten Commandments including
 
02:40:08.910 --> 02:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
commandment number nine which is Thou
 
02:40:12.150 --> 02:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
shalt not bear false witness so
 
02:40:14.230 --> 02:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um New Hampshire
 
02:40:15.790 --> 02:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
legislators have been cons have
 
02:40:18.510 --> 02:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
consistently received false witness
 
02:40:20.550 --> 02:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
about um so-called Right to Work bills
 
02:40:22.150 --> 02:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to correct just some of the
 
02:40:25.110 --> 02:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
record um the truth is that no matter
 
02:40:27.070 --> 02:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
what is claimed by the Bill's proponents
 
02:40:29.230 --> 02:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
the historic Origins and purposes of
 
02:40:31.670 --> 02:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
this bill are to divide workers and
 
02:40:34.030 --> 02:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
 Union strength and Effectiveness
 
02:40:36.030 --> 02:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
the truth is that for decades Right to
 
02:40:38.269 --> 02:40:38.279 align:start position:0%
Work proponents have made wildly false
 
02:40:40.830 --> 02:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
claims about employers just waiting at
 
02:40:42.590 --> 02:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's borders to set up shop
 
02:40:45.030 --> 02:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
in our state of only the spill is passed
 
02:40:48.030 --> 02:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
but no one no one has ever been able to
 
02:40:50.469 --> 02:40:50.479 align:start position:0%
identify a single business that falls
 
02:40:52.590 --> 02:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
into this category of waiting at our
 
02:40:54.830 --> 02:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
borders and the reason is because they
 
02:40:57.510 --> 02:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
do not exist they didn't exist in West
 
02:41:00.429 --> 02:41:00.439 align:start position:0%
Virginia either and the governor said so
 
02:41:03.950 --> 02:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh the truth is that um New Hampshire
 
02:41:06.389 --> 02:41:06.399 align:start position:0%
employers with unionized employees and
 
02:41:07.990 --> 02:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
you've just heard this from several
 
02:41:10.510 --> 02:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
employers and employer groups are not
 
02:41:13.790 --> 02:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
asking for this bill um this bill is
 
02:41:16.630 --> 02:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
focused on employers with unions so you
 
02:41:18.590 --> 02:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
can take all the testimony you want from
 
02:41:20.710 --> 02:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
business group that represent primarily
 
02:41:23.269 --> 02:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
non-unions employers but this is about
 
02:41:25.510 --> 02:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
telling employers with unions what they
 
02:41:27.950 --> 02:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
can and can't do in their own contracts
 
02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
and I will say that that um they are not
 
02:41:34.309 --> 02:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
asking you to do this no employer has
 
02:41:36.910 --> 02:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
come to you and said employer with a
 
02:41:38.550 --> 02:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
union has come to you and said help me
 
02:41:40.870 --> 02:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
for myself I don't know what's best for
 
02:41:42.990 --> 02:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
me so do something for me by making a
 
02:41:45.670 --> 02:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
certain contract clause illegal um the
 
02:41:47.870 --> 02:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
other thing is this just very very
 
02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
quickly um this Bill the national Right
 
02:41:52.190 --> 02:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
to Work committee has not told where
 
02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
apprciate your testimony and your
 
02:41:57.230 --> 02:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
passion comments do we have you read my
 
02:41:58.870 --> 02:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
testimony about where this bill really
 
02:42:01.630 --> 02:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
came from yes ma'am thank you do you
 
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
have any
 
02:42:05.190 --> 02:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you so much
 
02:42:07.510 --> 02:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate your
 
02:42:11.309 --> 02:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
time and Aubrey Friedman please and on
 
02:42:17.590 --> 02:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:21.150 --> 02:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
paof Committee Member MERS Aubrey fre um
 
02:42:22.990 --> 02:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mr chairman committee members
 
02:42:25.469 --> 02:42:25.479 align:start position:0%
Aubrey Friedman I live in Bridgewater I
 
02:42:28.830 --> 02:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
speak in support of this bill um the
 
02:42:32.230 --> 02:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
main thing is that all workers are not
 
02:42:34.349 --> 02:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
the same they're individuals we have
 
02:42:37.150 --> 02:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
some workers that are more skilled some
 
02:42:39.389 --> 02:42:39.399 align:start position:0%
are smarter and frankly some work harder
 
02:42:41.630 --> 02:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
than others why should there be a
 
02:42:43.950 --> 02:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement that
 
02:42:45.790 --> 02:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
treats everybody the
 
02:42:49.230 --> 02:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
same individual members who work for the
 
02:42:51.630 --> 02:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
company should be able to negotiate
 
02:42:54.070 --> 02:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
directly that's the Crux of the issue
 
02:42:56.670 --> 02:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
here it's the collective bargaining that
 
02:42:59.750 --> 02:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
makes everyone be part of the collective
 
02:43:03.269 --> 02:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
I have uh my son is actually in a union
 
02:43:06.429 --> 02:43:06.439 align:start position:0%
I I never joined a union I just didn't
 
02:43:10.429 --> 02:43:10.439 align:start position:0%
need to and I was able to and I'm not a
 
02:43:12.870 --> 02:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
fantastic negotiator I was always able
 
02:43:16.550 --> 02:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
to get the wages or conditions benefits
 
02:43:19.710 --> 02:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
whatever it was that satisfied me and I
 
02:43:22.469 --> 02:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
didn't want a third party to represent
 
02:43:24.910 --> 02:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
me and I think there are other people
 
02:43:27.670 --> 02:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
who feel the same way too I'm not
 
02:43:29.630 --> 02:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
opposed to the unions but forcing
 
02:43:33.110 --> 02:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
everybody to become part of it and uh
 
02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
and then this business about the uh
 
02:43:37.950 --> 02:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
benefits and I've heard people bring it
 
02:43:40.830 --> 02:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
up several times and they say Well
 
02:43:42.550 --> 02:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
they're getting the benefits but they're
 
02:43:45.950 --> 02:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
not paying if you negotiate separately
 
02:43:48.110 --> 02:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
for yourself with your employer which
 
02:43:49.830 --> 02:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
you should be free to
 
02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
do then why do they have to offer you
 
02:43:55.389 --> 02:43:55.399 align:start position:0%
you can't get the same bet so somebody
 
02:43:57.950 --> 02:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
said well they went to a hearing for no
 
02:44:00.150 --> 02:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
you don't get the goodies if you're not
 
02:44:02.269 --> 02:44:02.279 align:start position:0%
willing to pay and that's just part of
 
02:44:04.190 --> 02:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
choosing not to join a union they should
 
02:44:06.190 --> 02:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
be free to do that maybe they'll do
 
02:44:08.030 --> 02:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
better maybe they'll do worse I don't
 
02:44:10.830 --> 02:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
know depends up however they do it
 
02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
you're you're an individual you've got a
 
02:44:15.150 --> 02:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
mind you can speak for yourself if it
 
02:44:17.269 --> 02:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't work out you'll go somewhere
 
02:44:20.150 --> 02:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
else so I think think that's the Crux of
 
02:44:22.630 --> 02:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
the issue the problem is the collective
 
02:44:25.269 --> 02:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
if let's say 90% of the people want to
 
02:44:27.070 --> 02:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
join let them have their own Union their
 
02:44:30.349 --> 02:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
benefit 10% don't they don't get the
 
02:44:34.469 --> 02:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
goodies let them be separate employers
 
02:44:37.110 --> 02:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
handle all kinds of different uh
 
02:44:39.950 --> 02:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
negotiations all the time and it's not
 
02:44:43.389 --> 02:44:43.399 align:start position:0%
like everybody is just set the way it is
 
02:44:45.469 --> 02:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
I mean that's how many private
 
02:44:47.870 --> 02:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
Industries work they just they have
 
02:44:50.070 --> 02:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
different benefits it's all different it
 
02:44:53.670 --> 02:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be one size fits all so
 
02:44:55.070 --> 02:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
I think that's the problem the
 
02:44:57.469 --> 02:44:57.479 align:start position:0%
collective part of it if it were allowed
 
02:45:00.110 --> 02:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
to be separate uh where you could
 
02:45:01.510 --> 02:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
negotiate your
 
02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
own uh whatever you wanted for your
 
02:45:07.070 --> 02:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
wages and conditions and benefits then
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
let it be if the 90% let them have their
 
02:45:13.429 --> 02:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
own thing why Force the other 10% or
 
02:45:15.309 --> 02:45:15.319 align:start position:0%
whoever it might be I still think most
 
02:45:17.389 --> 02:45:17.399 align:start position:0%
people would probably choose the union
 
02:45:20.269 --> 02:45:20.279 align:start position:0%
but for those who don't leave them alone
 
02:45:22.550 --> 02:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
let's don't be a busy body you worry
 
02:45:24.670 --> 02:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
about that's it thank you thank you
 
02:45:26.150 --> 02:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you sir I appreciate your

do thank you for testifying did you know
 
02:45:54.630 --> 02:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
since the Janice decision that the

public sector has lost over a million
 
02:45:58.040 --> 02:45:59.990 align:start position:0%
public sector has lost over a million
union

02:45:59.990 --> 02:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
union
 
02:46:03.630 --> 02:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
members uh but aren't people still
 
02:46:05.670 --> 02:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
contributing I mean the unions still
 
02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
seem to be pretty active from what I've
 
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
seen that's the numbers that I'm hearing
 
02:46:13.190 --> 02:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
or reading is that a million people
 
02:46:16.190 --> 02:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
don't want to okay so this is a question
 
02:46:18.670 --> 02:46:18.680 align:start position:0%

hookit and Dan Barton uh I testify in
 
02:46:47.190 --> 02:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and yet another
 
02:46:49.510 --> 02:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
reason to support it because it will
 
02:46:53.230 --> 02:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
help help New Hampshire children Harvard
 
02:46:56.429 --> 02:46:56.439 align:start position:0%
University uh they published uh research
 
02:47:00.309 --> 02:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
called the longrun effects of right to
 
02:47:03.269 --> 02:47:03.279 align:start position:0%
work laws you can find it on their
 
02:47:07.269 --> 02:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
website and Benjamin Austin and Matthew
 
02:47:11.269 --> 02:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
Lily they uh studied years upon years of
 
02:47:14.790 --> 02:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
data comparing to V States and states
 
02:47:18.389 --> 02:47:18.399 align:start position:0%
that don't have this legislation and one
 
02:47:21.950 --> 02:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
of the Central findings was that right
 
02:47:25.389 --> 02:47:25.399 align:start position:0%
to work laws are associated with lower
 
02:47:25.399 --> 02:47:26.710 align:start position:0%
to work laws are associated with lower
childhood

02:47:26.710 --> 02:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
childhood
 
02:47:31.950 --> 02:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
poverty and uh uh actually children from
 
02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:33.110 align:start position:0%
poverty and uh uh actually children from
poor

02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
poor
 
02:47:37.269 --> 02:47:37.279 align:start position:0%
families uh in uh uh if they are growing
 
02:47:40.230 --> 02:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
up in a right to walk
 
02:47:43.150 --> 02:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
location uh they have
 
02:47:47.070 --> 02:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
1.7 percentage Point higher probability
 
02:47:50.830 --> 02:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
of succeeding fin finally in their life
 
02:47:54.070 --> 02:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
so it's a greater upward Mobility it's a
 
02:47:57.349 --> 02:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
chance for kids from poor family to
 
02:47:57.359 --> 02:47:58.630 align:start position:0%
chance for kids from poor family to
become

02:47:58.630 --> 02:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
become
 
02:48:04.190 --> 02:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
financially um substantial and um uh uh
 
02:48:07.469 --> 02:48:07.479 align:start position:0%
it's uh proven uh scientifically this
 
02:48:10.550 --> 02:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
difference in outcomes were not present
 
02:48:12.550 --> 02:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
prior to the passage of right to work
 
02:48:15.670 --> 02:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
laws they persist after controlling for
 
02:48:18.190 --> 02:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
other major policy differences between
 
02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:19.429 align:start position:0%
other major policy differences between
states

02:48:19.429 --> 02:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh and uh they do not appear primarily
 
02:48:26.469 --> 02:48:26.479 align:start position:0%
attributable to local substitutions so
 
02:48:29.469 --> 02:48:29.479 align:start position:0%
please help New Hampshire children
 
02:48:32.030 --> 02:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
succeed thank you for considering and
 
02:48:35.110 --> 02:48:35.120 align:start position:0%

02:48:59.110 --> 02:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
ma'am good afternoon as I am 5'2 I have
 
02:49:01.910 --> 02:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
no choice but to keep this short I am a
 
02:49:03.790 --> 02:49:03.800 align:start position:0%
veteran who proudly served eight years
 
02:49:05.830 --> 02:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
in the United States Marine Corps I
 
02:49:07.590 --> 02:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
would still be serving today if I hadn't
 
02:49:10.429 --> 02:49:10.439 align:start position:0%
literally worn myself to the Bone if my
 
02:49:12.790 --> 02:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
Marines and I protested for higher pay
 
02:49:14.670 --> 02:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
and better working conditions we would
 
02:49:17.110 --> 02:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
have been charged with Mutiny this is
 
02:49:19.750 --> 02:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
all to say I understand and appreciate
 
02:49:21.309 --> 02:49:21.319 align:start position:0%
the power that the voices of the
 
02:49:23.630 --> 02:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
American workers possess especially when
 
02:49:26.190 --> 02:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
echoed in unison and that they should be
 
02:49:29.150 --> 02:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
protected I stand Here on broken ankles
 
02:49:32.229 --> 02:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
to oppose HB 238 for the repercussions
 
02:49:34.910 --> 02:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
it poses and the false promises it makes
 
02:49:37.510 --> 02:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
to every hardworking citizen of New
 
02:49:39.590 --> 02:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the Right to Work bill
 
02:49:41.670 --> 02:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
promises extra money in the individual's
 
02:49:43.630 --> 02:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
pocket and the freedom to choose where
 
02:49:46.870 --> 02:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
to work as a woman Living in America I
 
02:49:48.349 --> 02:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
understand the sanctity and the ability
 
02:49:51.790 --> 02:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
to shoes but the language issued in this
 
02:49:54.790 --> 02:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
bill and promotional material for it are
 
02:49:57.590 --> 02:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
intentionally misleading what this bill
 
02:49:59.710 --> 02:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
will actually accomplish is division
 
02:50:01.870 --> 02:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
amongst workers making them weaker in
 
02:50:03.750 --> 02:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
their Singularity and the
 
02:50:06.030 --> 02:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
Union's ability to provide competitive
 
02:50:08.510 --> 02:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
wages vital employer-based health
 
02:50:10.269 --> 02:50:10.279 align:start position:0%
coverage protection against
 
02:50:13.150 --> 02:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
discrimination amongst countless other
 
02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
benefits according to this bill the
 
02:50:17.670 --> 02:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
freedom from Union fees is intended to
 
02:50:19.710 --> 02:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
promote individuals applying to and
 
02:50:22.429 --> 02:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
working for Industries in New Hampshire
 
02:50:24.110 --> 02:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
this is a farce and a distraction from
 
02:50:25.910 --> 02:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
the true barriers to employment that
 
02:50:28.550 --> 02:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
American workers are facing unlivable
 
02:50:31.229 --> 02:50:31.239 align:start position:0%
minimum wage lack of affordable housing
 
02:50:33.950 --> 02:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
health care and child care as well as
 
02:50:36.790 --> 02:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
unchecked predatory business practices
 
02:50:39.830 --> 02:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
such as ghost ghost job postings
 
02:50:42.429 --> 02:50:42.439 align:start position:0%
intentional understaffing and decreasing
 
02:50:44.670 --> 02:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
full-time positions to undercut the
 
02:50:46.910 --> 02:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
workforce all of this while corporate
 
02:50:49.309 --> 02:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
profit is at an all-time high along with
 
02:50:52.150 --> 02:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
the prices for essential Goods food and
 
02:50:54.750 --> 02:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
gas if we want to strengthen the working
 
02:50:56.630 --> 02:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
class we must address these issues
 
02:50:58.790 --> 02:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
through a holistic approach that handles
 
02:51:01.469 --> 02:51:01.479 align:start position:0%
each aspect as a portion of the problem
 
02:51:03.910 --> 02:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
and not as individual issues we must
 
02:51:05.870 --> 02:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
come together as a community and work
 
02:51:07.870 --> 02:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
towards a resolution that allows all
 
02:51:10.510 --> 02:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
workers the ability to achieve gainful
 
02:51:13.469 --> 02:51:13.479 align:start position:0%
employment the answer is not in division
 
02:51:16.630 --> 02:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
and Singularity it is in Union we are
 
02:51:18.990 --> 02:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
stronger together thank you for your
 
02:51:21.229 --> 02:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
time thank you Mar I appreciate your
 
02:51:26.030 --> 02:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:26.040 --> 02:51:27.990 align:start position:0%
 
questions

02:51:27.990 --> 02:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:51:30.309 --> 02:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
please if I understood your testimony
 
02:51:32.469 --> 02:51:32.479 align:start position:0%
you were a marine that is correct sir
 
02:51:34.469 --> 02:51:34.479 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that for the service
 
02:51:36.510 --> 02:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your support you've heard a
 
02:51:40.269 --> 02:51:40.279 align:start position:0%
lot about defending Freedom here uh in
 
02:51:42.349 --> 02:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
terms of the way this is being
 
02:51:45.190 --> 02:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
characterize this particular Bill yes
 
02:51:46.750 --> 02:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
sir now you fought for freedom for a
 
02:51:49.150 --> 02:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
long time yes sir so what is your
 
02:51:51.550 --> 02:51:51.560 align:start position:0%
opinion of this legislation as it
 
02:51:56.110 --> 02:51:56.120 align:start position:0%
relates to freedom and and do you see
 
02:51:59.710 --> 02:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
this as is interfering with your freedom
 
02:52:01.269 --> 02:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
it's not interfering with my personal
 
02:52:03.870 --> 02:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
freedom but in my opinion the worker is
 
02:52:06.670 --> 02:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
still free to choose not to work for a
 
02:52:09.710 --> 02:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
union if they don't want a union job
 
02:52:13.429 --> 02:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
don't apply for a union job to me it's
 
02:52:13.439 --> 02:52:14.750 align:start position:0%
don't apply for a union job to me it's
that

02:52:14.750 --> 02:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:52:17.269 --> 02:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
simple representative
 
02:52:19.510 --> 02:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
Granger do do you think most workers
 
02:52:21.190 --> 02:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
want to be in a union or do you think
 
02:52:22.630 --> 02:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
that the revealed preferences is that
 
02:52:24.389 --> 02:52:24.399 align:start position:0%
they don't want to be in a
 
02:52:26.469 --> 02:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
union I believe that those who are
 
02:52:28.870 --> 02:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
educated about what a union can provide
 
02:52:31.710 --> 02:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
would choose to work with a union thank
 
02:52:34.110 --> 02:52:34.120 align:start position:0%

02:52:36.550 --> 02:52:36.560 align:start position:0%

all the committee members um my name is
 
02:53:19.670 --> 02:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
Joe Gallagher I in Manchester I'm a
 
02:53:21.429 --> 02:53:21.439 align:start position:0%
retired member of local six heat and
 
02:53:23.950 --> 02:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
frost insulators and Allied Workers
 
02:53:25.950 --> 02:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
again right to work does make your
 
02:53:29.030 --> 02:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
constituents lose in the long run I'm
 
02:53:30.790 --> 02:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
not paid to be here but I wish to give
 
02:53:33.190 --> 02:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
some examples of the detrimental cost
 
02:53:35.910 --> 02:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
from right to work our local Works in
 
02:53:38.030 --> 02:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Maine Mass R Island and
 
02:53:40.830 --> 02:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
partially in Vermont and
 
02:53:43.630 --> 02:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and when work is slow we can
 
02:53:45.630 --> 02:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
go to other areas of the country and
 
02:53:47.990 --> 02:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
work because they have similar type
 
02:53:52.229 --> 02:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
unions to us and a lot of our guys used
 
02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
to go down to Florida to work which is a
 
02:53:56.349 --> 02:53:56.359 align:start position:0%
big right to work state now and they
 
02:53:57.309 --> 02:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
could work
 
02:54:00.190 --> 02:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
in the Jacksonville local the Tampa
 
02:54:01.710 --> 02:54:01.720 align:start position:0%
local the Miami
 
02:54:01.720 --> 02:54:03.670 align:start position:0%
local the Miami
local

02:54:03.670 --> 02:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
local
 
02:54:06.870 --> 02:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
now those locals are in
 
02:54:09.750 --> 02:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
receivership okay those workers are up
 
02:54:12.429 --> 02:54:12.439 align:start position:0%
here working for us because we're fairly
 
02:54:15.870 --> 02:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
busy and they're working at a good
 
02:54:15.880 --> 02:54:16.870 align:start position:0%
busy and they're working at a good
living

02:54:16.870 --> 02:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
living
 
02:54:20.030 --> 02:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
wage but they tell us what their wage is
 
02:54:21.670 --> 02:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
down there and it's less than half of
 
02:54:24.750 --> 02:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
what our wage is here and the benefits
 
02:54:27.750 --> 02:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
are all degraded so I've seen this over
 
02:54:30.110 --> 02:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
the years I'm been around 50 years in
 
02:54:33.389 --> 02:54:33.399 align:start position:0%
the business so that's going to be a
 
02:54:35.389 --> 02:54:35.399 align:start position:0%
cost to your
 
02:54:38.550 --> 02:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
constituents next
 
02:54:41.790 --> 02:54:41.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know the Merit shops will get
 
02:54:43.590 --> 02:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
less than that so if they're getting
 
02:54:45.750 --> 02:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
less than 50% of us the Merit shops are
 
02:54:48.030 --> 02:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
even going under that so when it came
 
02:54:51.309 --> 02:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
here say my peace many times in the past
 
02:54:53.630 --> 02:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
I always noticed the same thing and it's
 
02:54:54.790 --> 02:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
a little different today you got a lot
 
02:54:57.349 --> 02:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
of people fall right to work but most of
 
02:55:00.870 --> 02:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
the time as it's always been like six
 
02:55:05.349 --> 02:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
for and 150 against so you know it's
 
02:55:07.269 --> 02:55:07.279 align:start position:0%
Groundhog Day all over again I said it
 
02:55:08.750 --> 02:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
before at these
 
02:55:11.070 --> 02:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
meetings okay the last two times this
 
02:55:13.790 --> 02:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
bill came up and if it passed and I was
 
02:55:17.190 --> 02:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
here both times it would have a little
 
02:55:18.910 --> 02:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
economic effect on those New Hampshire
 
02:55:20.950 --> 02:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
because we've been going to the Fisher
 
02:55:23.349 --> 02:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
Cats game since day one Mark McKenzie
 
02:55:26.070 --> 02:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
would remember Union night and we have
 
02:55:28.990 --> 02:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
never stopped but my local said to me
 
02:55:31.710 --> 02:55:31.720 align:start position:0%
which is headquartered in Boston said
 
02:55:33.550 --> 02:55:33.560 align:start position:0%
listen if your state passes right to
 
02:55:36.550 --> 02:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
work you're going to the woo socks
 
02:55:39.150 --> 02:55:39.160 align:start position:0%
so four years ago I remember the
 
02:55:41.150 --> 02:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
gentleman that ran the uh Fisher Cats he
 
02:55:44.590 --> 02:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
talked to the labor chair um who's the
 
02:55:49.349 --> 02:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
that rep from uh the insurance rep
 
02:55:51.910 --> 02:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
invent time yeah will he he called will
 
02:55:53.349 --> 02:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
he was upset you know he says I'm going
 
02:55:56.269 --> 02:55:56.279 align:start position:0%
to lose clients so my point is real
 
02:55:59.309 --> 02:55:59.319 align:start position:0%
simple it's all about money here
 
02:56:03.030 --> 02:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
and let me see I did send this to you
 
02:56:05.550 --> 02:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
email and if you want me to resend it in
 
02:56:07.950 --> 02:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
case of it went to spam that's fine so
 
02:56:10.110 --> 02:56:10.120 align:start position:0%
like I said the woo we also do Canopy
 
02:56:11.950 --> 02:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
Lake we have all the families do a
 
02:56:14.590 --> 02:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
picnic that's on the table too you know
 
02:56:16.150 --> 02:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's not me making that decision I've
 
02:56:19.550 --> 02:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
been retired 11 years if and think of
 
02:56:21.590 --> 02:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
all these people that live out of state
 
02:56:23.670 --> 02:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
that are in Union say half a million in
 
02:56:25.269 --> 02:56:25.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they come up here on
 
02:56:27.670 --> 02:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
vacation because I can talk I talk to
 
02:56:30.309 --> 02:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
guys that do this all the time they say
 
02:56:31.590 --> 02:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
what's going on in New Hampshire
 
02:56:33.550 --> 02:56:33.560 align:start position:0%

freedom of Association that it

02:58:32.030 --> 02:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
reform already law of the land in Most
 
02:58:34.150 --> 02:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
states which would simply protect
 
02:58:35.750 --> 02:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
workers from being compelled to pay
 
02:58:38.510 --> 02:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
union dues or fees without their consent
 
02:58:40.870 --> 02:58:40.880 align:start position:0%

Hampshire a union boson claim Monopoly
 
02:58:48.150 --> 02:58:48.160 align:start position:0%

taking away the individual's right to
 
02:58:52.309 --> 02:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
negotiate for thems the union boss then
 
02:58:53.950 --> 02:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
demands the government enforced
 
02:58:56.070 --> 02:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
authority to extract mandatory dues or
 
02:58:58.870 --> 02:58:58.880 align:start position:0%

02:59:01.150 --> 02:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
insult to injury this poll showed the
 
02:59:02.790 --> 02:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
vast majority of Voters agree it's just
 
02:59:05.910 --> 02:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
plain wrong bill would guarantee workers
 
02:59:07.510 --> 02:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
the right to decide for themselves
 
02:59:09.110 --> 02:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not labor union deserves
 
02:59:11.110 --> 02:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
their financial support same as any
 
02:59:12.510 --> 02:59:12.520 align:start position:0%

02:59:26.830 --> 02:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
support it Iowa is a right to work state
 
02:59:28.510 --> 02:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
we have to earn our membership if we
 
02:59:31.389 --> 02:59:31.399 align:start position:0%
support that we lose too many members
 
02:59:32.630 --> 02:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
you see without Right to Work
 
02:59:34.429 --> 02:59:34.439 align:start position:0%
protections there's little incentive for
 
02:59:36.910 --> 02:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
Union officials to offer a good service
 
02:59:38.349 --> 02:59:38.359 align:start position:0%
they can compel people to pay them
 
02:59:41.110 --> 02:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
either way fact is good unions don't
 
02:59:43.670 --> 02:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
need forc dues bad unions don't deserve
 
02:59:45.990 --> 02:59:46.000 align:start position:0%

House Bill 238 thank you thank you sir

appreciate your testimony do we have any
 
03:00:58.710 --> 03:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
questions representative McKenzie thank
 
03:01:00.750 --> 03:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:01:03.550 --> 03:01:03.560 align:start position:0%
your appearance for this committee uh
 
03:01:05.790 --> 03:01:05.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to read you a a a statement
 
03:01:09.590 --> 03:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to ask you to uh let us
 
03:01:11.950 --> 03:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
know if this is correct this statement
 
03:01:13.469 --> 03:01:13.479 align:start position:0%
comes directly from the National Labor
 
03:01:15.550 --> 03:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
Relations Board and it says the
 
03:01:18.070 --> 03:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
following employees may choose not to to
 
03:01:20.550 --> 03:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
become union members and pay dues are
 
03:01:23.150 --> 03:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
opt out uh to pay dues their share of
 
03:01:25.389 --> 03:01:25.399 align:start position:0%
the dues so it says the National Labor
 
03:01:28.269 --> 03:01:28.279 align:start position:0%
Relations Board is saying that people
 
03:01:30.790 --> 03:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
are not compelled to be union members
 
03:01:32.389 --> 03:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
and they're not compelled to be in the
 
03:01:34.309 --> 03:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
union do you agree with that statement
 
03:01:36.510 --> 03:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
or disagree with the statement that
 
03:01:38.269 --> 03:01:38.279 align:start position:0%
comes directly from the National Labor
 
03:01:38.279 --> 03:01:40.110 align:start position:0%
comes directly from the National Labor
Relations

03:01:40.110 --> 03:01:40.120 align:start position:0%
Relations
 
03:01:42.790 --> 03:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
material workers can be forced to pay
 
03:01:45.510 --> 03:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
union bosses that's not the question
 
03:01:48.190 --> 03:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
independent of their membership on the
 
03:01:50.950 --> 03:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
roles those workers are forced to join
 
03:01:54.870 --> 03:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
the union in a way every bit as sincere
 
03:01:57.110 --> 03:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
as if they were on the roles they are
 
03:01:59.830 --> 03:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
still compelled to associate with that
 
03:02:02.349 --> 03:02:02.359 align:start position:0%
Union they're forced to fund that Union
 
03:02:06.469 --> 03:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
that they may disagree with and they get
 
03:02:07.910 --> 03:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
the short end of the stick and that they
 
03:02:11.870 --> 03:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
lose the ability to try and change the
 
03:02:15.309 --> 03:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
business agent representing them so
 
03:02:19.030 --> 03:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
they are still forced to join Union in
 
03:02:21.790 --> 03:02:21.800 align:start position:0%
the broad sense of the word in the true
 
03:02:24.030 --> 03:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
sense of the word Mr chairman I have a
 
03:02:26.870 --> 03:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up question for a
 
03:02:29.150 --> 03:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
followup I'm GNA I'm going to ask you
 
03:02:30.830 --> 03:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
again if I could
 
03:02:32.990 --> 03:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
respectfully do you agree with the
 
03:02:35.110 --> 03:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
statement that comes to the National
 
03:02:36.670 --> 03:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
Labor Relations Board that says
 
03:02:40.389 --> 03:02:40.399 align:start position:0%
employees may not uh may choose not to
 
03:02:44.429 --> 03:02:44.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:47.429 --> 03:02:47.439 align:start position:0%
dues Webster's Dictionary defines join
 
03:02:50.070 --> 03:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
as quote to associate oneself with end
 
03:02:52.229 --> 03:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
quote and certainly any worker compelled
 
03:02:53.870 --> 03:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
to provide material support for an
 
03:02:56.349 --> 03:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
organization is inherently compelled to
 
03:02:58.269 --> 03:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
associate with it Force unionism
 
03:03:00.269 --> 03:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
violates individual workers freedom of
 
03:03:02.070 --> 03:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
Association whether or not the union
 
03:03:03.550 --> 03:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
lists him on his official membership
 
03:03:06.269 --> 03:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
roles or let them vote on internal
 
03:03:10.190 --> 03:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
affairs and as was alluded to in earlier
 
03:03:13.030 --> 03:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
testimony we can consider carefully a
 
03:03:14.990 --> 03:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
quote from Article 2 Section one of the
 
03:03:17.269 --> 03:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
UAW New National contract quote
 
03:03:19.469 --> 03:03:19.479 align:start position:0%
employees covered by this agreement at
 
03:03:21.590 --> 03:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
the time it becomes effective and who
 
03:03:22.950 --> 03:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
are members of the Union at that time
 
03:03:24.550 --> 03:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
shall be required as a condition of
 
03:03:25.990 --> 03:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
continued employment to continue
 
03:03:28.349 --> 03:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
membership in the union for the duration
 
03:03:30.710 --> 03:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
of this agreement employees covered by
 
03:03:32.429 --> 03:03:32.439 align:start position:0%
this agreement who are not members at
 
03:03:33.550 --> 03:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
the time this agreement becomes
 
03:03:36.229 --> 03:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
effective shall be required as a
 
03:03:38.190 --> 03:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
condition of continued employment to
 
03:03:40.910 --> 03:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
become members of the Union end quote
 
03:03:43.510 --> 03:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps the UAW is being frank here and
 
03:03:45.190 --> 03:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
the practices fall short of what is
 
03:03:47.550 --> 03:03:47.560 align:start position:0%
permissible under current law or perhaps
 
03:03:49.870 --> 03:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
the UW is simply trying to mislead
 
03:03:51.830 --> 03:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
workers strong arming them into
 
03:03:54.269 --> 03:03:54.279 align:start position:0%
submission either way right to work law
 
03:03:55.990 --> 03:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
would help Shield Granite Staters from
 
03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:57.830 align:start position:0%
would help Shield Granite Staters from
such

03:03:57.830 --> 03:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
such
 
03:04:00.830 --> 03:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
Injustice okay thank you representative
 
03:04:02.830 --> 03:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
Granger thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:04:04.429 --> 03:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I've asked this
 
03:04:06.229 --> 03:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
to other people perhaps you don't have
 
03:04:08.710 --> 03:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
the data because previous people I've
 
03:04:10.630 --> 03:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
asked did not have the data uh do you
 
03:04:13.110 --> 03:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
have any data that shows whether or not
 
03:04:14.870 --> 03:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
States when they pass a Right to Work
 
03:04:19.070 --> 03:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
bill whether that puts wages up or down
 
03:04:22.309 --> 03:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
yes I actually so I alluded to that in
 
03:04:24.670 --> 03:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
my testimony where the cost of living
 
03:04:28.429 --> 03:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
adjusted disposable income does go up
 
03:04:28.439 --> 03:04:29.190 align:start position:0%
adjusted disposable income does go up
that

03:04:29.190 --> 03:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:04:32.630 --> 03:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
is typically secondary to job creation
 
03:04:36.269 --> 03:04:36.279 align:start position:0%
uh Market forces tend to dictate salary
 
03:04:37.630 --> 03:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
and as you have more companies moving
 
03:04:40.710 --> 03:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
into a state and creating more jobs
 
03:04:42.349 --> 03:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
there's more competition for workers so
 
03:04:46.870 --> 03:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
that will naturally drive up uh wages I
 
03:04:48.190 --> 03:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
can definitely
 
03:04:50.389 --> 03:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
send the committee some specific studies
 
03:04:52.590 --> 03:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
or I can dig through and pull some out
 
03:04:54.790 --> 03:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
but they're academic research papers
 
03:04:57.990 --> 03:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
that might not be the most brief or
 
03:05:00.750 --> 03:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
compelling testimony on a
 
03:05:03.710 --> 03:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
timeline yeah please submit those four
 
03:05:07.110 --> 03:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
committee consideration yes sir and let
 
03:05:09.910 --> 03:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
me get um representative McKenzie uh
 
03:05:12.670 --> 03:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh very quickly uh
 
03:05:15.510 --> 03:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
I've heard the uh the language that you
 
03:05:18.150 --> 03:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
have uh entered into the testimony here
 
03:05:21.190 --> 03:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
relative to the UAW contract the last
 
03:05:22.950 --> 03:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
time we had the right to work hearing I
 
03:05:25.870 --> 03:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
asked either you or the another
 
03:05:28.349 --> 03:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
representative to produce that uh
 
03:05:31.110 --> 03:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
information I actually called the UAW uh
 
03:05:33.429 --> 03:05:33.439 align:start position:0%
I can't find that language if you could
 
03:05:35.429 --> 03:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
produce that language to the committee
 
03:05:38.030 --> 03:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
that would be good because it would
 
03:05:40.790 --> 03:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
suggest that they are they are in
 
03:05:43.349 --> 03:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
violation of the law so if you could
 
03:05:44.750 --> 03:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
produce that for the committee we would
 
03:05:47.030 --> 03:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you Mr chairman
 
03:05:48.150 --> 03:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:05:50.110 --> 03:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Sullivan
 
03:05:53.150 --> 03:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
sir thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:05:56.750 --> 03:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you referenced U
 
03:05:59.670 --> 03:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
increases in uh Economic Development
 
03:06:02.349 --> 03:06:02.359 align:start position:0%
businesses moving into uh a new right to
 
03:06:05.150 --> 03:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
work state can you
 
03:06:08.229 --> 03:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
name several businesses that are on the
 
03:06:10.950 --> 03:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
border dying to come in if we pass right
 
03:06:10.960 --> 03:06:12.990 align:start position:0%
border dying to come in if we pass right
to

03:06:12.990 --> 03:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:06:16.469 --> 03:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
work that is a tricky question in part
 
03:06:18.150 --> 03:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
because any business will to go on the
 
03:06:20.469 --> 03:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
record saying such a thing is vulnerable
 
03:06:23.269 --> 03:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
to unfair Labor practice prosecution
 
03:06:25.710 --> 03:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
under the National Labor Relations Board
 
03:06:27.429 --> 03:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
uh especially as appointed by Biden
 
03:06:30.030 --> 03:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
we've seen that with a lot of the auto
 
03:06:32.389 --> 03:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who have explicitly talked
 
03:06:35.190 --> 03:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
about expanding in the right to work
 
03:06:37.110 --> 03:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
South as opposed to States like
 
03:06:38.469 --> 03:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
Washington or Oregon and then got
 
03:06:42.469 --> 03:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
whacked for it uh one example of a
 
03:06:43.830 --> 03:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
company that was willing to go on the
 
03:06:46.229 --> 03:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
record was from Ruger here in New
 
03:06:48.590 --> 03:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I've
 
03:06:52.790 --> 03:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
got plenty of additional job creation uh
 
03:06:54.070 --> 03:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
information I would be thrilled to
 
03:06:56.190 --> 03:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
submit to the record as well and I'd be
 
03:06:58.030 --> 03:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
happy to read through it at length if
 
03:07:01.830 --> 03:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:05.309 --> 03:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
committee I would agree thank you okay
 
03:07:07.110 --> 03:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh if you could submit that
 
03:07:09.150 --> 03:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
through the portal and to the clerk I'd
 
03:07:14.550 --> 03:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:19.590 --> 03:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
stab yes um I received this on my porch
 
03:07:21.469 --> 03:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
um and there's some information on here
 
03:07:23.389 --> 03:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if you can um
 
03:07:26.309 --> 03:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
tell us where this this data came from
 
03:07:29.070 --> 03:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
it says that um uh families and right to
 
03:07:31.790 --> 03:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
work states earn on average
 
03:07:35.750 --> 03:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
$4,200 in real household
 
03:07:38.990 --> 03:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
income I guess that means more um um
 
03:07:40.910 --> 03:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
Economic Policy Institute on the other
 
03:07:44.269 --> 03:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
hand says in non-right to work states um
 
03:07:48.309 --> 03:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
people receive three 3,940
 
03:07:51.349 --> 03:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
more um and also there's some data here
 
03:07:53.710 --> 03:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
about um right to work states having
 
03:07:55.710 --> 03:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
nearly three times more job growth in
 
03:07:57.630 --> 03:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the last decade can you
 
03:08:00.070 --> 03:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
tell me where this information came
 
03:08:04.510 --> 03:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
from sure so the first is National
 
03:08:06.550 --> 03:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
Institute of Labor Relations research
 
03:08:10.790 --> 03:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
they are using mer data that's Missouri
 
03:08:14.190 --> 03:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
economic resource information and I'm
 
03:08:16.429 --> 03:08:16.439 align:start position:0%
probably losing the last few words there
 
03:08:18.269 --> 03:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
uh based on the Bureau of economic
 
03:08:21.950 --> 03:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
research I can also submit that to the
 
03:08:27.630 --> 03:08:27.640 align:start position:0%
committee uh the job creation itself is
 
03:08:29.590 --> 03:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
similarly uh National Institute of Labor
 
03:08:32.990 --> 03:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
Relations research and should be in that
 
03:08:34.830 --> 03:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
same Source
 
03:08:41.229 --> 03:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:43.990 --> 03:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
length Okay please submit that data any
 
03:08:46.950 --> 03:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Susi
 
03:08:48.070 --> 03:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:08:50.429 --> 03:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
taking the question so I'm fortunate
 
03:08:51.870 --> 03:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
enough to be able to travel the South
 
03:08:53.389 --> 03:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
through South Carolina and vacation
 
03:08:57.309 --> 03:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
during the summer um with my family and
 
03:08:59.309 --> 03:08:59.319 align:start position:0%
as I'm traveling down there I sometimes
 
03:09:01.790 --> 03:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
I take the corridor of 95 and I see that
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
on the corridor of 95 for about four
 
03:09:08.150 --> 03:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
miles there are many companies that
 
03:09:08.160 --> 03:09:09.389 align:start position:0%
miles there are many companies that
manufactur

03:09:09.389 --> 03:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
manufactur
 
03:09:12.309 --> 03:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
vehicles I looked up to see why they
 
03:09:15.389 --> 03:09:15.399 align:start position:0%
would go there energy costs are lower
 
03:09:18.429 --> 03:09:18.439 align:start position:0%
easier for them to transport taxes a
 
03:09:22.030 --> 03:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
lower so my question to you is in the
 
03:09:23.870 --> 03:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire right now where
 
03:09:26.190 --> 03:09:26.200 align:start position:0%
we have some of the highest taxes in
 
03:09:29.309 --> 03:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
real estate we have a housing crisis it
 
03:09:32.510 --> 03:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
a uh energy costs are ABS uh
 
03:09:35.150 --> 03:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
astronomical and it's not really easy to
 
03:09:39.590 --> 03:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
transport um their items through the
 
03:09:41.190 --> 03:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I guess I'm
 
03:09:44.229 --> 03:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
curious as to how you feel that these
 
03:09:46.030 --> 03:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
companies would prefer to come to New
 
03:09:47.910 --> 03:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rather than going to a state
 
03:09:50.590 --> 03:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
like South Carolina North Carolina these
 
03:09:52.030 --> 03:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
companies that are waiting to come in
 
03:09:54.510 --> 03:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
here well fortunately we don't have to
 
03:09:57.070 --> 03:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
rely on my speculation uh there are
 
03:10:00.110 --> 03:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
plenty of sources where people actually
 
03:10:03.389 --> 03:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
go out and ask these exact job creators
 
03:10:06.110 --> 03:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
I mentioned area development magazines
 
03:10:09.030 --> 03:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
surveys the gentleman from the national
 
03:10:10.710 --> 03:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
Federation of Independent businesses
 
03:10:14.150 --> 03:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned their surveys I would be again
 
03:10:16.110 --> 03:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
thrilled to read at length additional
 
03:10:20.910 --> 03:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
surveys of of such job creators um but I
 
03:10:24.190 --> 03:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
would be basing that claim off what
 
03:10:27.710 --> 03:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:31.870 --> 03:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:34.389 --> 03:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry go
 
03:10:37.229 --> 03:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair so question on
 
03:10:38.910 --> 03:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
the Janice decision I've heard that said
 
03:10:40.389 --> 03:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
several times how do you think that
 
03:10:42.150 --> 03:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
changes uh what we're looking at here on
 
03:10:45.670 --> 03:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
the current bill uh and what it does
 
03:10:47.550 --> 03:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question so the
 
03:10:47.560 --> 03:10:48.670 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question so the
Janice

03:10:48.670 --> 03:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
Janice
 
03:10:51.590 --> 03:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
decision essentially brings Right to
 
03:10:53.870 --> 03:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
Work protections to the public sector
 
03:10:55.950 --> 03:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
Nationwide so
 
03:10:58.790 --> 03:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
that for the time being solves the
 
03:11:00.190 --> 03:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
problem for many public sector workers
 
03:11:02.670 --> 03:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the same problem
 
03:11:04.389 --> 03:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
remains for private sector workers so
 
03:11:06.389 --> 03:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
we're seeking to expand those freedoms
 
03:11:07.830 --> 03:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
that the Supreme
 
03:11:10.950 --> 03:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
Court protecting the Janice decision to
 
03:11:13.830 --> 03:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
the private sector uh there's also
 
03:11:15.790 --> 03:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
always the risk with judicial precedent
 
03:11:17.870 --> 03:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
that it could be overturned
 
03:11:19.510 --> 03:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh we saw that the Janice decision
 
03:11:22.750 --> 03:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
itself overturned previous president um
 
03:11:24.389 --> 03:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
roie Wade is a prominent example
 
03:11:26.550 --> 03:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
recently and so passing New Hampshire
 
03:11:28.870 --> 03:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
right to work law would enshrine those
 
03:11:30.269 --> 03:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
right to work protections for New
 
03:11:32.030 --> 03:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire workers in the public sector
 
03:11:35.070 --> 03:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
even if the Supreme Court were to issue
 
03:11:38.190 --> 03:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
a contradictory opinion down the
 
03:11:42.229 --> 03:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
line thank you represent resident cing
 
03:11:44.710 --> 03:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
all right are there any questions
 
03:11:47.790 --> 03:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
representive L cler St uh for
 
03:11:59.349 --> 03:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:01.550 --> 03:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you and
 
03:12:04.110 --> 03:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
representative L clerk thank you Mr
 
03:12:06.790 --> 03:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
03:12:09.830 --> 03:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
earlier I you heard my conversation with
 
03:12:13.469 --> 03:12:13.479 align:start position:0%
Mr Helm and and um and I I would agree
 
03:12:15.150 --> 03:12:15.160 align:start position:0%
that at least 80% of New England
 
03:12:17.870 --> 03:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
citizens and the granted State citizens
 
03:12:20.110 --> 03:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
believe that everybody has the right to
 
03:12:23.190 --> 03:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
work but my question to him and to you
 
03:12:28.830 --> 03:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
will be of those 80% how many do you
 
03:12:31.389 --> 03:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
think understand what this bill really
 
03:12:34.710 --> 03:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
is and and and you know I I I understand
 
03:12:36.030 --> 03:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
your description and my description they
 
03:12:36.950 --> 03:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
probably going to be two different
 
03:12:40.030 --> 03:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
things but if they understood that this
 
03:12:41.910 --> 03:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
was probably a union busting bill would
 
03:12:41.920 --> 03:12:42.790 align:start position:0%
was probably a union busting bill would
they

03:12:42.790 --> 03:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:12:45.670 --> 03:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
even would they even have an opinion
 
03:12:48.550 --> 03:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
sure so different polls will phrase the
 
03:12:50.750 --> 03:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
question different ways I'm not aware of
 
03:12:52.950 --> 03:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
any polls that will just say do you
 
03:12:54.670 --> 03:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
support right to work without giving any
 
03:12:57.830 --> 03:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
context it's actually more common that
 
03:12:59.670 --> 03:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
they will instead of using the phrase
 
03:13:01.710 --> 03:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
Right to Work explain the logistics of
 
03:13:04.429 --> 03:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
the bill um I mean at the national level
 
03:13:06.910 --> 03:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
we've got survey USA or Gallop holes
 
03:13:08.590 --> 03:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
that would certainly include New
 
03:13:13.030 --> 03:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:15.790 --> 03:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
things when Americans are asked if they
 
03:13:17.469 --> 03:13:17.479 align:start position:0%
agree that workers should should never
 
03:13:21.790 --> 03:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
be forced to join or pay a union uh this
 
03:13:25.389 --> 03:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
Gallop poll is Right to Work
 
03:13:27.510 --> 03:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
directly see the
 
03:13:29.550 --> 03:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
question some states have passed Right
 
03:13:31.389 --> 03:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
to Work of open shop laws that say each
 
03:13:33.750 --> 03:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
worker has the right to hold job in a
 
03:13:35.870 --> 03:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
company regardless his association with
 
03:13:38.469 --> 03:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
the labor union if you asked to vote on
 
03:13:39.950 --> 03:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
such a law would you have for it or
 
03:13:43.110 --> 03:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
against it uh this is a WMUR Granite
 
03:13:43.120 --> 03:13:44.630 align:start position:0%
against it uh this is a WMUR Granite
State

03:13:44.630 --> 03:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
State
 
03:13:54.550 --> 03:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:55.950 --> 03:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
man they don't have the specific
 
03:13:58.590 --> 03:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
phrasing on here but it says they given
 
03:14:00.429 --> 03:14:00.439 align:start position:0%
the basic premise behind the law and
 
03:14:03.830 --> 03:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
that is typical for these so they will
 
03:14:06.990 --> 03:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh yeah they will explain the bill not
 
03:14:09.790 --> 03:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
just throw out the shorthand reference
 
03:14:13.790 --> 03:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
to it uh as part of the polling process
 
03:14:17.190 --> 03:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
may I please for for a quick please yes
 
03:14:20.389 --> 03:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
thank you um and the way those questions
 
03:14:23.710 --> 03:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
were phrased I would probably say yeah I
 
03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
agree that not every company should be a
 
03:14:25.680 --> 03:14:26.950 align:start position:0%
agree that not every company should be a
union

03:14:26.950 --> 03:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
union
 
03:14:29.870 --> 03:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
company but again would if if a person
 
03:14:33.510 --> 03:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
knows that you know I'm just trying
 
03:14:36.349 --> 03:14:36.359 align:start position:0%
to that this bill is
 
03:14:39.990 --> 03:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
really to uh kind of eradicate the
 
03:14:41.670 --> 03:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
unions you think it's someone would if
 
03:14:44.309 --> 03:14:44.319 align:start position:0%
you ask the person hey do you wish there
 
03:14:46.630 --> 03:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
were no more unions around do you think
 
03:14:50.190 --> 03:14:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:53.309 --> 03:14:53.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I think perhaps you're mistaken
 
03:14:54.750 --> 03:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
about the language of the bill and would
 
03:14:58.389 --> 03:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
invite you to reread the
 
03:15:00.990 --> 03:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that how about answer my
 
03:15:03.670 --> 03:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
question all right um last question go

ahead representative farington does this
 
03:15:07.590 --> 03:15:07.600 align:start position:0%

closer uh my name is Deborah H I am
 
03:15:54.750 --> 03:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
president of the American Federation of
 
03:15:57.710 --> 03:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
teachers New Hampshire we are a state
 
03:16:00.790 --> 03:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
Federation of local labor unions mostly
 
03:16:04.150 --> 03:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
in prek through 12 Public Schools we
 
03:16:06.389 --> 03:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
also have City and town employees we
 
03:16:08.710 --> 03:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
have a University faculty including one
 
03:16:12.189 --> 03:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
private university which makes this um
 
03:16:14.229 --> 03:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation relevant to us we
 
03:16:16.590 --> 03:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
also are standing in solidarity with our
 
03:16:18.229 --> 03:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
private sector Union brothers and
 
03:16:22.229 --> 03:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
sisters we oppose HB 238 the Right to
 
03:16:25.550 --> 03:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
Work bill and I will be very brief here
 
03:16:30.429 --> 03:16:30.439 align:start position:0%
um this is interference in negotiations
 
03:16:33.349 --> 03:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
between private sector employers and
 
03:16:36.070 --> 03:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
private sector unions a workplace does
 
03:16:38.309 --> 03:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
not become unionized unless the workers
 
03:16:40.389 --> 03:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
vote to do so so already you know that
 
03:16:42.309 --> 03:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
is a majority of workers have to vote to
 
03:16:42.319 --> 03:16:43.469 align:start position:0%
is a majority of workers have to vote to
become

03:16:43.469 --> 03:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
become
 
03:16:46.510 --> 03:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
unionized then you have negotiations
 
03:16:50.349 --> 03:16:50.359 align:start position:0%
over the contract not every workplace
 
03:16:52.389 --> 03:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
has an agency fee or fair share fee
 
03:16:54.429 --> 03:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
whatever you call it that is not the
 
03:16:57.070 --> 03:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
same as paying union dues union dues
 
03:16:58.790 --> 03:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
gives you membership and aay in how the
 
03:17:02.750 --> 03:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
union is run agency Fe agency fee all
 
03:17:05.590 --> 03:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
the covers the cost of negotiating the
 
03:17:09.030 --> 03:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
contract and enforcing or maintaining
 
03:17:11.309 --> 03:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
the contract so that its terms apply
 
03:17:14.309 --> 03:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
fairly to all the members of the
 
03:17:18.349 --> 03:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
workforce having a law that says you
 
03:17:21.349 --> 03:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
cannot negotiate that fee even if the
 
03:17:24.950 --> 03:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
employer wants it and the union wants it
 
03:17:26.309 --> 03:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
is government interference that's not
 
03:17:28.070 --> 03:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
how we work in New Hampshire we think
 
03:17:30.030 --> 03:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
the private sector should be able to be
 
03:17:32.389 --> 03:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
the private sector and the government
 
03:17:33.710 --> 03:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
should government should not be telling
 
03:17:35.790 --> 03:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
it what to
 
03:17:38.630 --> 03:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
do so that's the you know that's really
 
03:17:40.710 --> 03:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
the Crux of what I have to say that's
 
03:17:42.229 --> 03:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
not how we work in New Hampshire we have
 
03:17:44.030 --> 03:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
a long tradition of rejecting this kind
 
03:17:46.590 --> 03:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
of interference in private employment
 
03:17:47.870 --> 03:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's a long tradition of standing
 
03:17:50.469 --> 03:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
up for common sense and I've heard it as
 
03:17:55.110 --> 03:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
a worker Liberty uh frame you don't have
 
03:17:57.110 --> 03:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
the Liberty to go to your accountant and
 
03:18:00.150 --> 03:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
say well you've done my taxes and you've
 
03:18:01.790 --> 03:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
provided me a service but now I want the
 
03:18:03.910 --> 03:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
liberty of not to pay for it you also
 
03:18:05.950 --> 03:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
don't have the liberty of saying to the
 
03:18:09.429 --> 03:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
union that has been elected by the other
 
03:18:11.910 --> 03:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
workers in your workplace and saying you
 
03:18:13.590 --> 03:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
know yeah you negotiated a contract for
 
03:18:17.790 --> 03:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
me you are also taking on the cost of of
 
03:18:20.469 --> 03:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
maintaining it which the employer has
 
03:18:22.229 --> 03:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
agreed you have the right to charge for
 
03:18:23.550 --> 03:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
but now I don't want to pay for it
 
03:18:26.389 --> 03:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
that's called theft of services we urge
 
03:18:29.910 --> 03:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
you to find HB 238 in expedience to
 
03:18:32.269 --> 03:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
legislate it's not a freedom
 
03:18:35.110 --> 03:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
issue a paying for services issue I do
 
03:18:37.389 --> 03:18:37.399 align:start position:0%

others who you work with he um
 
03:20:49.349 --> 03:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
actually asked for his employees to be
 
03:20:52.309 --> 03:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
unionized uh for the purpose of uh he
 
03:20:54.269 --> 03:20:54.279 align:start position:0%
couldn't grow his business and
 
03:20:57.150 --> 03:20:57.160 align:start position:0%
successfully provide for his
 
03:20:59.990 --> 03:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
employees people often confuse the word
 
03:21:02.990 --> 03:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
Union as an entity all to itself however
 
03:21:05.990 --> 03:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
I am the union we are the union the
 
03:21:08.429 --> 03:21:08.439 align:start position:0%
union is not somebody or something it is
 
03:21:10.429 --> 03:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
an organization of workers form for the
 
03:21:12.189 --> 03:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
purpose of advancing its members
 
03:21:14.389 --> 03:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
interest in respect to wages benefits
 
03:21:16.870 --> 03:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
and working conditions
 
03:21:20.150 --> 03:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
to directly address comments um from
 
03:21:22.990 --> 03:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
previous uh speakers employees should
 
03:21:25.110 --> 03:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
determine their own Futures and I want
 
03:21:28.670 --> 03:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
to find people who value their Union to
 
03:21:31.070 --> 03:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
be in a union let me give you an example
 
03:21:34.189 --> 03:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
of this in may have 2020 many of the
 
03:21:36.870 --> 03:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
senior uh senior that's a term meaning
 
03:21:39.189 --> 03:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
we've been employed for a long time UPS
 
03:21:41.070 --> 03:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
employees were still angry over our
 
03:21:42.550 --> 03:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
contract of
 
03:21:45.429 --> 03:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
2018 uh a contracted that was so wildly
 
03:21:47.550 --> 03:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
unpopular drove many members to
 
03:21:49.670 --> 03:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
unofficially campaign for the O'Brien
 
03:21:51.990 --> 03:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
Zuckerman ticket speaking out against
 
03:21:55.389 --> 03:21:55.399 align:start position:0%
General President Jimmy hofa who is a
 
03:21:59.189 --> 03:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
famed uh son of mobster James haa I want
 
03:22:01.790 --> 03:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
to note that members had so much control
 
03:22:05.950 --> 03:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
over this um over their Union that in
 
03:22:10.710 --> 03:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
2021 General president uh was O'Brien
 
03:22:13.550 --> 03:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
one O'Brien and Zuckerman W and it was
 
03:22:15.870 --> 03:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
the first time in the IBT history that a
 
03:22:17.510 --> 03:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
president was elected that was not
 
03:22:21.150 --> 03:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
endorsed by the incumbent or was an
 
03:22:24.790 --> 03:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
incumbent in 2018 I submitted a proposal
 
03:22:28.469 --> 03:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
for the for um part- timr as a parttime
 
03:22:31.830 --> 03:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
employee um we were uh mandated to work
 
03:22:35.630 --> 03:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
a six day given our um production and
 
03:22:37.750 --> 03:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
that six day was not paid at time and a
 
03:22:40.229 --> 03:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
half as opposed to our brothers and
 
03:22:42.550 --> 03:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
sisters that were drivers and the result
 
03:22:44.710 --> 03:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
of that was an economic victory for my
 
03:22:47.030 --> 03:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
brothers and sisters who worked on Prime
 
03:22:49.630 --> 03:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
uh part-time shift as members we are
 
03:22:51.550 --> 03:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
asked to submit proposals to our Union
 
03:22:54.229 --> 03:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
for what we want in our new contract um
 
03:22:57.429 --> 03:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
it is part of the open meetings that we
 
03:23:01.469 --> 03:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
have and um anyone who is a member uh
 
03:23:04.429 --> 03:23:04.439 align:start position:0%

03:23:10.110 --> 03:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
you're
 
03:23:12.229 --> 03:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
focused uh do we have any thank you I
 
03:23:13.910 --> 03:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate it well thank you so much do
 
03:23:15.630 --> 03:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
you have any questions representative
 
03:23:17.630 --> 03:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
kahill please thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:23:20.950 --> 03:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
03:23:23.030 --> 03:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't catch the name of the
 
03:23:25.790 --> 03:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
founder of ups but it seems like he did
 
03:23:28.550 --> 03:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
have an interest in the you know good
 
03:23:30.469 --> 03:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
well-being of the company and the
 
03:23:32.710 --> 03:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
employees and I wonder if you could
 
03:23:35.309 --> 03:23:35.319 align:start position:0%
contrast that because I see a lot of
 
03:23:37.269 --> 03:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
brown trucks and then I see the same
 
03:23:40.229 --> 03:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
shape of truck only it's blue and
 
03:23:41.750 --> 03:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a van and sometimes it's
 
03:23:44.469 --> 03:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
a private vehicle with someone wearing
 
03:23:48.269 --> 03:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
uh an Amazon uh logo shirt Del making
 
03:23:49.870 --> 03:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
those deliveries would you be able to
 
03:23:52.469 --> 03:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
compare and contrast the work experience
 
03:23:55.269 --> 03:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
of a UPS versus an Amazon delivery
 
03:23:57.630 --> 03:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
person sure sure I can do that I think
 
03:23:59.670 --> 03:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's a good question uh one of the
 
03:24:01.510 --> 03:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
things that I would say is the Amazon
 
03:24:04.830 --> 03:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
has 10 50% turnover rate they're also
 
03:24:07.189 --> 03:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
one of the highest um rates for uh
 
03:24:09.309 --> 03:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
worker injury so there is no
 
03:24:11.469 --> 03:24:11.479 align:start position:0%
sustainability as far as employment in
 
03:24:14.950 --> 03:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
that sort of a environment um and I do
 
03:24:16.830 --> 03:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
think that one of the things that the
 
03:24:18.790 --> 03:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
general public may want to be interested
 
03:24:21.389 --> 03:24:21.399 align:start position:0%
in is that they are not employed by
 
03:24:23.830 --> 03:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
Amazon they are third-party delivery
 
03:24:26.229 --> 03:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
services which means that the service
 
03:24:28.790 --> 03:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
that UPS gives we are a service provider
 
03:24:30.670 --> 03:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
we are not a shipping company the
 
03:24:33.550 --> 03:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
service that we provide is um we are
 
03:24:36.630 --> 03:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
trained we understand safety that is not
 
03:24:37.830 --> 03:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
something that you're necessarily
 
03:24:40.389 --> 03:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
getting from the other package uh
 
03:24:44.830 --> 03:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
services that you um have and um because
 
03:24:47.710 --> 03:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
we do uh we are mandated to have some
 
03:24:49.550 --> 03:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
safety protocol in our in our
 
03:24:51.590 --> 03:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
environment that is something that also
 
03:24:53.429 --> 03:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
comes along with our union membership if
 
03:24:55.229 --> 03:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
we are in an environment where it's
 
03:24:58.910 --> 03:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
unsafe we can go to our um shop steward
 
03:25:00.469 --> 03:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
we can go to our business agent and we
 
03:25:01.830 --> 03:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
can say okay these are the things that
 
03:25:04.870 --> 03:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
are happening specific to like how I had
 
03:25:07.189 --> 03:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
a a change in our contract that was a
 
03:25:09.790 --> 03:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
incredible Financial win for part-time
 
03:25:12.110 --> 03:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
employees so um there is a huge
 
03:25:15.070 --> 03:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
difference we have a lot more um we have
 
03:25:17.510 --> 03:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
a lot more control over our environment
 
03:25:20.830 --> 03:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
as far as our our production our safety
 
03:25:26.469 --> 03:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
our benefits our um um just it's it's a
 
03:25:28.830 --> 03:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
completely different environment and our
 
03:25:32.429 --> 03:25:32.439 align:start position:0%
longevity which is important okay thank
 
03:25:35.990 --> 03:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
you representa Destro
 
03:25:38.110 --> 03:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
welcome hi thank you and thank you for
 
03:25:41.030 --> 03:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question so comparison on
 
03:25:43.670 --> 03:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
salary or hourly wage I guess I should
 
03:25:46.710 --> 03:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
say what's the same is it the same
 
03:25:51.150 --> 03:25:51.160 align:start position:0%
Amazon to uh yours and then explain the
 
03:25:53.990 --> 03:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
difference between that that that's a
 
03:25:57.469 --> 03:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
good question um I specifically am not
 
03:25:59.630 --> 03:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh versed entirely on their different
 
03:26:04.429 --> 03:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
scopes of employment um I would say that
 
03:26:06.990 --> 03:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
given our contract a lot of the other
 
03:26:08.950 --> 03:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
service providers have had to come up
 
03:26:11.910 --> 03:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
with their pay um our starting wage at
 
03:26:16.870 --> 03:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
UPS for my specific employment is 21 an
 
03:26:19.750 --> 03:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
hour um and as a part-time employee I
 
03:26:23.429 --> 03:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
receive overtime after 5 hours in in my
 
03:26:27.469 --> 03:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
um in my building um as far as
 
03:26:30.309 --> 03:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
Amazon I would say they probably are
 
03:26:36.189 --> 03:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
around the upper 19 or upper um teens um
 
03:26:38.830 --> 03:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
but when you're factoring an 150%
 
03:26:42.070 --> 03:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
turnover that wage is completely useless
 
03:26:45.030 --> 03:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
if you can't rely on long-term
 
03:26:46.830 --> 03:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
employment with someone and that is
 
03:26:49.710 --> 03:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
something I definitely guaranteed at UPS
 
03:26:51.590 --> 03:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
and to speak to that in somebody else's
 
03:26:53.469 --> 03:26:53.479 align:start position:0%
comment about well I might be a
 
03:26:55.269 --> 03:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
hardworking employee and the guy next to
 
03:26:58.309 --> 03:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
me might might not pull his weight well
 
03:26:59.790 --> 03:26:59.800 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is I want
 
03:27:01.830 --> 03:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
everybody to have a job I want everybody
 
03:27:03.990 --> 03:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
to provide for their family and I do
 
03:27:06.110 --> 03:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
work next to people who are may maybe
 
03:27:08.830 --> 03:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
have some sort of disability and I don't
 
03:27:10.590 --> 03:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
mind standing shoulder-to-shoulder with
 
03:27:13.110 --> 03:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
somebody else knowing that sometimes I
 
03:27:16.309 --> 03:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
have to hold them up and when I'm
 
03:27:19.550 --> 03:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
well I'm almost 50 when I'm still there
 
03:27:22.550 --> 03:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
in 9 years somebody is probably going to
 
03:27:25.150 --> 03:27:25.160 align:start position:0%
have to pull more packages than I do I
 
03:27:27.630 --> 03:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
go into work and I work uh a shift and I
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
pull, 1500 packages off the belt and
 
03:27:32.269 --> 03:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
load them on to package cars which is
 
03:27:35.229 --> 03:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
three times what some of my co-workers
 
03:27:37.630 --> 03:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
pull off the belt and I don't care
 
03:27:39.189 --> 03:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
because they deserve to have a job just
 
03:27:44.070 --> 03:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
as well as I do okay any further
 
03:27:46.269 --> 03:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
questions saying none thank you ma'am I
 
03:27:50.309 --> 03:27:50.319 align:start position:0%

the past 15 years last May I ran for
 
03:28:21.510 --> 03:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
election to represent the grant State
 
03:28:23.110 --> 03:28:23.120 align:start position:0%

03:28:29.429 --> 03:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
trades people Union or non to achieve
 
03:28:31.550 --> 03:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
higher wages benefits and safety
 
03:28:34.150 --> 03:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
standards today I speak in opposition of
 
03:28:34.160 --> 03:28:35.910 align:start position:0%
standards today I speak in opposition of
HB

03:28:35.910 --> 03:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
HB
 
03:28:39.229 --> 03:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
238 right to work is bad for the free
 
03:28:41.309 --> 03:28:41.319 align:start position:0%
market this Law requires a private
 
03:28:43.269 --> 03:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
business with agreements with another
 
03:28:45.030 --> 03:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
private business to provide its services
 
03:28:47.550 --> 03:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
at zero cost the last time I checked
 
03:28:49.429 --> 03:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
there is no law that requires a private
 
03:28:52.590 --> 03:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
business to require its services for
 
03:28:54.429 --> 03:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
free that's bad
 
03:28:56.630 --> 03:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
business also New Hampshire's legislator
 
03:28:58.150 --> 03:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
should not meddle in how privac
 
03:29:01.189 --> 03:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
businesses in the state work together
 
03:29:03.670 --> 03:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
for their Mutual benefit contracts
 
03:29:05.070 --> 03:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
between private employers and labor
 
03:29:07.670 --> 03:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
should be left to the free market
 
03:29:10.070 --> 03:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
period Right to Work lower safety
 
03:29:11.830 --> 03:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
standards this legislation is a race to
 
03:29:14.229 --> 03:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
the bottom on wages across the industry
 
03:29:15.630 --> 03:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
the construction industry in the whole
 
03:29:15.640 --> 03:29:16.630 align:start position:0%
the construction industry in the whole
country

03:29:16.630 --> 03:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
country
 
03:29:18.429 --> 03:29:18.439 align:start position:0%
studies show that wages in right to work
 
03:29:20.990 --> 03:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
states are almost 16% lower in right to
 
03:29:23.269 --> 03:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
work states than not safety standards
 
03:29:25.229 --> 03:29:25.239 align:start position:0%
also diminish in right to work
 
03:29:27.349 --> 03:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
states workers in right to work states
 
03:29:30.510 --> 03:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
have a 35 37% chance higher chance of
 
03:29:33.030 --> 03:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
dying than in states without these laws
 
03:29:34.790 --> 03:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
we negotiate for these safety standards
 
03:29:36.349 --> 03:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
and most cases are stronger than the
 
03:29:38.269 --> 03:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
ocean regulations and we enforce these
 
03:29:40.870 --> 03:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
to our C cbas we also protect from
 
03:29:43.870 --> 03:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
retaliatory actions for raising concerns
 
03:29:47.670 --> 03:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
on safety cons safety issues
 
03:29:50.030 --> 03:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
also right to work is backed by out of
 
03:29:51.510 --> 03:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
State corporate interest groups these
 
03:29:53.990 --> 03:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
laws are backed by interest groups like
 
03:29:55.790 --> 03:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
Americans for Prosperity there's a
 
03:29:57.349 --> 03:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
billionaire back shell company that
 
03:29:59.670 --> 03:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
works tirelessly tirelessly for large
 
03:30:02.429 --> 03:30:02.439 align:start position:0%
corporations like Amazon and Walmart
 
03:30:04.030 --> 03:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
they spend Millions trying to make sure
 
03:30:06.110 --> 03:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
that workers can't collectively bargain
 
03:30:08.150 --> 03:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
meanwhile that these workers work in
 
03:30:10.229 --> 03:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
under poor job conditions low wages and
 
03:30:12.309 --> 03:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
terrible benefits all the while while we
 
03:30:14.710 --> 03:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
as tax pay payers must make up their
 
03:30:17.630 --> 03:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
shortcomings social safety nets problem
 
03:30:18.910 --> 03:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
programs that are constantly being
 
03:30:21.510 --> 03:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
eroded to cut taxes Walmart employees
 
03:30:23.150 --> 03:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
make up the largest percentage of those
 
03:30:24.990 --> 03:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
receiving government benefits race to
 
03:30:29.830 --> 03:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:31.830 --> 03:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right to work claims that
 
03:30:34.070 --> 03:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
protects employees from joining a union
 
03:30:36.590 --> 03:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
the TA Hardley Act was enacted in 1947
 
03:30:38.309 --> 03:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
by a federal law which makes it illegal
 
03:30:40.429 --> 03:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
to be forced to join a union I am
 
03:30:43.510 --> 03:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
curious where is the testimony from dues
 
03:30:45.349 --> 03:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
paying members being oppressed by union
 
03:30:48.429 --> 03:30:48.439 align:start position:0%
dues I have yet to see one today this
 
03:30:50.269 --> 03:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
law creates Free Riders in our Rank and
 
03:30:52.070 --> 03:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
file they get all the benefits the
 
03:30:53.590 --> 03:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
pension the representation the legal
 
03:30:56.349 --> 03:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
services we provide at zero cost our
 
03:30:58.269 --> 03:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
members democratically choose the
 
03:31:00.349 --> 03:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
direction our our Union goes via secret
 
03:31:02.550 --> 03:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
ballot that goes for wage increases
 
03:31:04.550 --> 03:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
benefits charitable donations and
 
03:31:06.710 --> 03:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
Leadership this whole process for
 
03:31:09.070 --> 03:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
organizing is decided democratically
 
03:31:10.950 --> 03:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
from our owners and rank and file
 
03:31:12.349 --> 03:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
employees not
 
03:31:15.030 --> 03:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
forced and I'll close with a quote from
 
03:31:16.750 --> 03:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
the great Martin Luther King in our
 
03:31:18.990 --> 03:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
glorious fight for civil rights we must
 
03:31:20.550 --> 03:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
guard against being fooled by false
 
03:31:23.309 --> 03:31:23.319 align:start position:0%
slogans such as Right to Work provides
 
03:31:26.189 --> 03:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
no rights and no works his purpose is
 
03:31:28.429 --> 03:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
destroy labor union freedom of
 
03:31:29.870 --> 03:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining we demand this
 
03:31:32.510 --> 03:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
fraud be stopped thank you so much
 
03:31:34.670 --> 03:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative Granger thank you Mr
 
03:31:36.750 --> 03:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
03:31:38.590 --> 03:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
if people don't feel that their Union is
 
03:31:40.349 --> 03:31:40.359 align:start position:0%
bargaining in their best interest why
 
03:31:41.950 --> 03:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
should they be forced to pay for
 
03:31:44.750 --> 03:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
something they don't want uh they agreed
 
03:31:47.189 --> 03:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
to join our Union when uh if when we
 
03:31:49.670 --> 03:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
organize people they agree to join and
 
03:31:52.110 --> 03:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
abide by the rcba and the same that
 
03:31:53.630 --> 03:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
those agreements that take place between
 
03:31:55.670 --> 03:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
our contractors and our
 
03:31:59.030 --> 03:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
employees for a followup uh to clarify
 
03:32:00.910 --> 03:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
the people who are who do not want to
 
03:32:03.070 --> 03:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
join the Union why should people who do
 
03:32:04.630 --> 03:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
not feel that the union is bargaining in
 
03:32:06.229 --> 03:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
their best interest and do not want to
 
03:32:08.389 --> 03:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
be in the Union why should they pay for
 
03:32:10.309 --> 03:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
something that they do not
 
03:32:12.550 --> 03:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
want and just to me it's like I said
 
03:32:15.590 --> 03:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's just Freel loading that's it if
 
03:32:17.469 --> 03:32:17.479 align:start position:0%
they don't if they if they don't want to
 
03:32:20.429 --> 03:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
be in the union go find another job okay
 
03:32:24.670 --> 03:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie yes Mr chair
 
03:32:27.710 --> 03:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I'm going to make a
 
03:32:30.189 --> 03:32:30.199 align:start position:0%
statement and ask you if you if this is
 
03:32:34.150 --> 03:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
correct so 30% of the employees in a
 
03:32:39.590 --> 03:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
union can petition to desertify the
 
03:32:42.030 --> 03:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
Union uh they have that right under the
 
03:32:43.950 --> 03:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
federal lab relations La is that a
 
03:32:45.870 --> 03:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
correct statement I'm pretty sure I I I
 
03:32:49.349 --> 03:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
don't know the specifics thank you okay
 
03:32:51.150 --> 03:32:51.160 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
03:32:53.269 --> 03:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
Laing thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:32:55.229 --> 03:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
for taking my question this is very
 
03:32:57.990 --> 03:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
simple um generally speaking does the
 
03:33:00.389 --> 03:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
data show that union jobs are on the
 
03:33:03.150 --> 03:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
rise or on the fall they're on the rise
 
03:33:05.269 --> 03:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
do you have data to support that I don't
 
03:33:06.910 --> 03:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
but I just know that the popularity
 
03:33:09.070 --> 03:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
across this country towards them has has
 
03:33:11.349 --> 03:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
seen has seen dramatic
 
03:33:13.469 --> 03:33:13.479 align:start position:0%
increases okay especially the younger
 
03:33:14.830 --> 03:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
people that are coming up through the
 
03:33:16.630 --> 03:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
through the through the colle education
 
03:33:18.870 --> 03:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
through even through trades in general
 
03:33:20.389 --> 03:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
people like the idea of being able to
 
03:33:24.110 --> 03:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
stand together Beyond politics follow
 
03:33:27.469 --> 03:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
okay Jim follow for a followup please um
 
03:33:30.269 --> 03:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair if I wanted to find
 
03:33:32.229 --> 03:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
this data I was waiting for you to come
 
03:33:33.710 --> 03:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
up because you have tons of data and I
 
03:33:35.469 --> 03:33:35.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate that yeah where do I find
 
03:33:37.070 --> 03:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
this data that tells most stuff the
 
03:33:38.790 --> 03:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
stuff I did find was from Gallup like it
 
03:33:41.070 --> 03:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
was polls conducted from Gallop okay
 
03:33:42.150 --> 03:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
it's important the committee knows
 
03:33:43.389 --> 03:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
whether or not union jobs are on the
 
03:33:46.110 --> 03:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
rise or on the fall yeah I mean to you
 
03:33:48.710 --> 03:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
they're on the rise yeah okay thank you
 
03:33:51.990 --> 03:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and representative
 
03:33:54.469 --> 03:33:54.479 align:start position:0%
Schultz I suspect this representative
 
03:33:56.630 --> 03:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
stab's going to say the same thing we
 
03:33:58.389 --> 03:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
are in contact with some of the
 
03:34:00.110 --> 03:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
organizations Gallup that he mentioned
 
03:34:02.870 --> 03:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
is nonpartisan I'm happy to provide some
 
03:34:05.309 --> 03:34:05.319 align:start position:0%
research because I love doing that I
 
03:34:08.750 --> 03:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
think I can find sources that are some
 
03:34:10.590 --> 03:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
that maybe are skewed to us and I'll
 
03:34:13.030 --> 03:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
note that and some that are nonpartisan
 
03:34:15.950 --> 03:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
and do um polling of the whole whole
 
03:34:19.030 --> 03:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
country uh reported on the news is that
 
03:34:22.550 --> 03:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
what you say to you no sorry thank you
 
03:34:25.429 --> 03:34:25.439 align:start position:0%

03:34:28.510 --> 03:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um earlier we heard
 
03:34:31.429 --> 03:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
from the um uh Carpenters Union that
 
03:34:34.750 --> 03:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
they have an apprentice program um uh my
 
03:34:37.790 --> 03:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
question is uh do do the iron workers
 
03:34:40.030 --> 03:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
also have a similar Apprentice program
 
03:34:42.790 --> 03:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
and what kinds of jobs do iron workers
 
03:34:46.150 --> 03:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
do so you know we do heavy construction
 
03:34:48.590 --> 03:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
from you know things that involve cranes
 
03:34:50.030 --> 03:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
most of the time when we're doing things
 
03:34:52.550 --> 03:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
but anything from the concrete that goes
 
03:34:55.110 --> 03:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
on the bridges the steel that goes onto
 
03:34:57.389 --> 03:34:57.399 align:start position:0%
Bridges to curtain wall that goes on the
 
03:34:58.630 --> 03:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
side of the building where you see your
 
03:35:00.590 --> 03:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
glass to the highrises you see across
 
03:35:01.910 --> 03:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know and then and all the way down
 
03:35:04.710 --> 03:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
to like stairs handrails you know that's
 
03:35:06.269 --> 03:35:06.279 align:start position:0%
kind of what our expertise is our
 
03:35:08.550 --> 03:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
education is the same very similar to
 
03:35:10.910 --> 03:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
the Carpenters it's at no cost to our
 
03:35:13.510 --> 03:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
members uh it's provided like we have
 
03:35:16.630 --> 03:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
funds that um and we also get grants for
 
03:35:18.349 --> 03:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
some of our programs as well so the
 
03:35:20.349 --> 03:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
members who do work or decideed to join
 
03:35:22.469 --> 03:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
a union there is no cost to the
 
03:35:25.990 --> 03:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
education may ask a followup yes ma'am
 
03:35:28.990 --> 03:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:35:32.349 --> 03:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
um are there enough iron workers
 
03:35:36.469 --> 03:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
currently no thank you representative
 
03:35:38.429 --> 03:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
Granger thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:35:40.349 --> 03:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
for taking my question would you believe
 
03:35:42.309 --> 03:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
that according to the AFL union
 
03:35:44.070 --> 03:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
membership has been down consistently
 
03:35:45.870 --> 03:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
since 1954
 
03:35:47.510 --> 03:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
I would agree and a lot of it has to do
 
03:35:51.309 --> 03:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
with laws just like this thank you okay
 
03:35:52.950 --> 03:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
any further
 
03:35:54.910 --> 03:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir I appreciate you
 
03:35:58.070 --> 03:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
working your testimony than you your
 
03:36:01.469 --> 03:36:01.479 align:start position:0%
time and uh Lisa
 
03:36:03.389 --> 03:36:03.399 align:start position:0%
Shapiro Mr
 
03:36:06.070 --> 03:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
chairman yes sir um while we're waiting
 
03:36:09.750 --> 03:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
for her to get settled um earlier you
 
03:36:11.550 --> 03:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
would inform me that there's an intent
 
03:36:15.110 --> 03:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
to exec this bill today yes sir um and
 
03:36:15.120 --> 03:36:16.389 align:start position:0%
to exec this bill today yes sir um and
um

03:36:16.389 --> 03:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:18.110 --> 03:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
at the time didn't have a big problem
 
03:36:20.510 --> 03:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
with it but when I'm seeing the amount
 
03:36:22.189 --> 03:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
of testimony that people are going to be
 
03:36:24.070 --> 03:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
submitting to the committee and the
 
03:36:25.550 --> 03:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
amount of written testimony that we've
 
03:36:27.550 --> 03:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
also received um I'm becoming
 
03:36:29.389 --> 03:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
increasingly less comfortable with the
 
03:36:32.670 --> 03:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
idea of executing this bill today for
 
03:36:35.389 --> 03:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
for us to execute today and then receive
 
03:36:38.550 --> 03:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
testimony or information that we've
 
03:36:41.309 --> 03:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
requested tomorrow or the next day uh
 
03:36:42.830 --> 03:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
seems like an insult to some of the
 
03:36:46.150 --> 03:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
folks who have uh testified and it puts
 
03:36:47.750 --> 03:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
us in the position of not not being
 
03:36:50.429 --> 03:36:50.439 align:start position:0%
fully informed when we do have that exec
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
vote um so I I I didn't want to spring
 
03:36:55.030 --> 03:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
it on you at the last second so I'm
 
03:36:57.229 --> 03:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
springing in on you
 
03:37:00.750 --> 03:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
now absolutely I understand um let's
 
03:37:02.469 --> 03:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
hear the testimony and make an
 
03:37:04.030 --> 03:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
assessment when we get done thank you
 
03:37:05.710 --> 03:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
that's a good
 
03:37:09.030 --> 03:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
point over to you Ma'am okay uh thank
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I'm sorry one second uh
 
03:37:15.110 --> 03:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
John Webb is on Deck okay great thank
 
03:37:16.830 --> 03:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman members of the committee
 
03:37:18.950 --> 03:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
my name is Dr Lisa Shapiro I'm an
 
03:37:20.830 --> 03:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
economist at Gallagher Callahan and
 
03:37:23.590 --> 03:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
gartell in conquered New Hampshire and
 
03:37:26.309 --> 03:37:26.319 align:start position:0%
I'm here today on behalf of the AFL CIO
 
03:37:29.429 --> 03:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
in opposition to HB
 
03:37:33.189 --> 03:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
238 um Right to Work Advocates assert
 
03:37:35.030 --> 03:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
that it would um right to work states
 
03:37:37.429 --> 03:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
outperform non-right to work states you
 
03:37:38.830 --> 03:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
certainly heard that from a couple of
 
03:37:40.950 --> 03:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
the speakers today and therefore it
 
03:37:44.110 --> 03:37:44.120 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial to pass such a law
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
and that passing it would enhance
 
03:37:48.389 --> 03:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
economic freedom these arguments should
 
03:37:51.910 --> 03:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
be rejected on several grounds the best
 
03:37:55.189 --> 03:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
information published in peer reviewed
 
03:37:58.429 --> 03:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
journals not just public policy shops or
 
03:38:01.229 --> 03:38:01.239 align:start position:0%
a statistical analysis but peer reviewed
 
03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
journals documents that right to work
 
03:38:09.229 --> 03:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
lowers wages for example a 2020 uh study
 
03:38:11.830 --> 03:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
in the Journal of financial economics
 
03:38:14.590 --> 03:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
reviewed nearly 20,000 collective
 
03:38:16.469 --> 03:38:16.479 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements
 
03:38:19.429 --> 03:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
in States over a 25-year period that had
 
03:38:21.910 --> 03:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
adopted right to work and it found that
 
03:38:24.229 --> 03:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
in those right to work states there is a
 
03:38:27.389 --> 03:38:27.399 align:start position:0%
decrease in workers wage growth and an
 
03:38:29.469 --> 03:38:29.479 align:start position:0%
increase in executive
 
03:38:32.670 --> 03:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
compensation in a 2023 Federal Reserve
 
03:38:36.349 --> 03:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
researchers closely analyzed wages in
 
03:38:39.110 --> 03:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
six states that adopted right to work
 
03:38:41.550 --> 03:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
and they compare those conditions before
 
03:38:44.110 --> 03:38:44.120 align:start position:0%
and after and with other states that had
 
03:38:46.870 --> 03:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
an adopted right to work and in response
 
03:38:48.389 --> 03:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
they did find and you've heard this
 
03:38:51.510 --> 03:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
today a slight uptick in employment
 
03:38:53.830 --> 03:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's how I know it's balanced when the
 
03:38:55.630 --> 03:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
study doesn't just go one way or the
 
03:38:57.550 --> 03:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
other and this is what you would expect
 
03:39:01.830 --> 03:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
you may find you know a a handful some
 
03:39:04.349 --> 03:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
business that comes to the state because
 
03:39:06.950 --> 03:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
of right to work that's their number one
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
priority and you may find it and there
 
03:39:13.110 --> 03:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
is a small uptick in the data however
 
03:39:15.990 --> 03:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
there was a statistically significant
 
03:39:19.830 --> 03:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
and quite substantial 4% reduction in
 
03:39:22.910 --> 03:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
median wages for those people that are
 
03:39:25.030 --> 03:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
working in those
 
03:39:28.269 --> 03:39:28.279 align:start position:0%
States so some right to work states are
 
03:39:31.429 --> 03:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
doing well some uh comp but simply
 
03:39:33.830 --> 03:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
comparing right to work states with
 
03:39:36.550 --> 03:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
those that don't you really are missing
 
03:39:39.030 --> 03:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
what the controlling variables are and
 
03:39:41.830 --> 03:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
there's competing explanations for high
 
03:39:43.150 --> 03:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
electric rates we've heard some
 
03:39:45.830 --> 03:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
discussion business climate so really
 
03:39:48.070 --> 03:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
studies that claim that this is the
 
03:39:50.469 --> 03:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
Panacea and these states are better you
 
03:39:53.150 --> 03:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
really need to look behind and see was
 
03:39:55.790 --> 03:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
it peer-reviewed is the data there I
 
03:39:58.229 --> 03:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
know for example there was a paper by a
 
03:40:01.349 --> 03:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
Harvard PhD business economics students
 
03:40:03.590 --> 03:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
this has been referred to as the Harvard
 
03:40:06.990 --> 03:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
study by several speakers today um I
 
03:40:09.550 --> 03:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
can't find it published in any peer
 
03:40:12.990 --> 03:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
reviewed uh uh place it has been picked
 
03:40:16.269 --> 03:40:16.279 align:start position:0%
up by some advocacy places that are in
 
03:40:18.630 --> 03:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
favor of right to work but I haven't
 
03:40:21.429 --> 03:40:21.439 align:start position:0%
seen it published anywhere it was cited
 
03:40:23.189 --> 03:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
and reviewed in the Federal Reserve
 
03:40:25.269 --> 03:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
paper so people are aware of it but it
 
03:40:27.950 --> 03:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
didn't find that result thank you thank
 
03:40:29.429 --> 03:40:29.439 align:start position:0%
you ma'am I appreciate your
 
03:40:34.469 --> 03:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:36.670 --> 03:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
suvan thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:40:40.110 --> 03:40:40.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my uh question um you um
 
03:40:42.830 --> 03:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
identified yourself as an economist yes
 
03:40:47.110 --> 03:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
um you come across as an expert um uh
 
03:40:51.349 --> 03:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
witness um could you give any could you
 
03:40:53.950 --> 03:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
determine if I'm right about that okay
 
03:40:56.469 --> 03:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
thank you um my area of specialty as in
 
03:40:59.189 --> 03:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
economics is really microeconomics not
 
03:41:02.349 --> 03:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
specifically labor um I have a lot of
 
03:41:04.229 --> 03:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
background I wrote my doctorate on
 
03:41:06.830 --> 03:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
property taxes and voting behavior I've
 
03:41:09.030 --> 03:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
testified on energy policies before the
 
03:41:11.750 --> 03:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
Public Utility Commission in the state
 
03:41:14.070 --> 03:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
and in the site evaluation committee on
 
03:41:17.110 --> 03:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
property tax impacts associated with uh
 
03:41:19.070 --> 03:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
development projects so I'm not a labor
 
03:41:21.070 --> 03:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
Economist I have been working with the
 
03:41:24.870 --> 03:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
AFL CIO uh starting uh this is my third
 
03:41:27.429 --> 03:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
time on this bill because with my
 
03:41:29.389 --> 03:41:29.399 align:start position:0%
economics background and microeconomics
 
03:41:31.750 --> 03:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
they asked me to review the literature
 
03:41:33.750 --> 03:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
that's out there especially with this
 
03:41:36.469 --> 03:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
Harvard study and trying to you know
 
03:41:38.710 --> 03:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
figure out what is the state of the
 
03:41:40.710 --> 03:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
literature what can we really conclude
 
03:41:42.670 --> 03:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
and that's what I've provided for today
 
03:41:48.389 --> 03:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:49.790 --> 03:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
03:41:51.550 --> 03:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned companies in
 
03:41:53.590 --> 03:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
other states that have come in again
 
03:41:56.149 --> 03:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
we've asked this throughout perhaps you
 
03:41:57.830 --> 03:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
know of some companies that have come
 
03:42:01.710 --> 03:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
into these right to work states and what
 
03:42:03.870 --> 03:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
was their Baseline compared to what the
 
03:42:07.870 --> 03:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
state already had the um because this is
 
03:42:10.429 --> 03:42:10.439 align:start position:0%
looking at it from a a perspective of
 
03:42:12.030 --> 03:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
the data they're not looking at
 
03:42:15.349 --> 03:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
individual companies so translating what
 
03:42:17.710 --> 03:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
I saw in the data to New Hampshire it
 
03:42:20.750 --> 03:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
would be something between 100 and 300
 
03:42:20.760 --> 03:42:22.030 align:start position:0%
would be something between 100 and 300
new

03:42:22.030 --> 03:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
new
 
03:42:26.429 --> 03:42:26.439 align:start position:0%
jobs off of a $750,000 base that's the
 
03:42:28.670 --> 03:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
some of the literature suggests so you
 
03:42:33.510 --> 03:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
basically have a um you know a handful
 
03:42:35.510 --> 03:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
or one big business that might be
 
03:42:37.469 --> 03:42:37.479 align:start position:0%
attracted now that doesn't mean in every
 
03:42:39.429 --> 03:42:39.439 align:start position:0%
state that was just in the aggregate
 
03:42:42.189 --> 03:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
looking at 25 years of History looking
 
03:42:45.670 --> 03:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
at it you you do find some place
 
03:42:48.309 --> 03:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
where there is you know a a very you
 
03:42:50.110 --> 03:42:50.120 align:start position:0%
know it's
 
03:42:53.269 --> 03:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
0.002% so or something like that um so I
 
03:42:55.309 --> 03:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
tried to translate that in my in my mind
 
03:42:56.910 --> 03:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
to what that mean in New Hampshire it
 
03:43:00.030 --> 03:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
was very small okay thank you for a
 
03:43:02.790 --> 03:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
followup yes ma'am and just I know the
 
03:43:04.389 --> 03:43:04.399 align:start position:0%
alarm went off I just wanted to hear
 
03:43:06.750 --> 03:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
your final thought before you cut off
 
03:43:08.229 --> 03:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
sure oh thank you for that um I
 
03:43:09.910 --> 03:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I think the I just
 
03:43:12.070 --> 03:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to say about the economic freedom
 
03:43:15.349 --> 03:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
argument um economic freedom uh in terms
 
03:43:16.750 --> 03:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
of being right to work is actually
 
03:43:18.990 --> 03:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
controversial in libertarian thought it
 
03:43:21.189 --> 03:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
is the majority opinion as far as I
 
03:43:23.070 --> 03:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
could tell among libertarian thought
 
03:43:25.189 --> 03:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
with the public policy groups and people
 
03:43:28.229 --> 03:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
that are advocating but it's it's well
 
03:43:30.429 --> 03:43:30.439 align:start position:0%
known that some leading Libertarians
 
03:43:33.110 --> 03:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
like Milton Freedman strongly opposed to
 
03:43:35.229 --> 03:43:35.239 align:start position:0%
right to work because two wrongs don't
 
03:43:38.790 --> 03:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
make a right um in fact he's not a big
 
03:43:42.070 --> 03:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
he was not a big fan of unions but was
 
03:43:43.790 --> 03:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
definitely against right to work because
 
03:43:45.469 --> 03:43:45.479 align:start position:0%
felt that that was an interv mention in
 
03:43:47.510 --> 03:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
the government and business and you've
 
03:43:49.349 --> 03:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
certainly heard some of that today
 
03:43:51.990 --> 03:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
similarly KO Institute which does their
 
03:43:54.630 --> 03:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh ranking of 50 states and who's the
 
03:43:57.910 --> 03:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
most free they admit in their report
 
03:43:59.149 --> 03:43:59.159 align:start position:0%
that it's controversial among
 
03:44:01.110 --> 03:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
Libertarians right to work and in the
 
03:44:04.189 --> 03:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
appendix they uh provide an alternative
 
03:44:07.349 --> 03:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
Freedom index that does not include the
 
03:44:08.870 --> 03:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
factor of whether your state has right
 
03:44:11.389 --> 03:44:11.399 align:start position:0%
to work because they recognize that many
 
03:44:13.550 --> 03:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
Libertarians and and people that support
 
03:44:16.710 --> 03:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
freedom in the market Place do not favor
 
03:44:18.149 --> 03:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
right to
 
03:44:21.110 --> 03:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
work okay thank you representative
 
03:44:24.429 --> 03:44:24.439 align:start position:0%
McKenzie uh thank you Mr
 
03:44:26.429 --> 03:44:26.439 align:start position:0%
chairman it's good to see you again by
 
03:44:30.550 --> 03:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
the way it's been a while the
 
03:44:33.229 --> 03:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
um what came up a couple of times during
 
03:44:35.830 --> 03:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
the testimony was our questions from the
 
03:44:37.790 --> 03:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
committee were was the whole question of
 
03:44:41.110 --> 03:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
the Berlin uh what's going on in Berlin
 
03:44:42.510 --> 03:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
now I don't know if you're in a position
 
03:44:46.670 --> 03:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
to talk about um why that that why that
 
03:44:49.229 --> 03:44:49.239 align:start position:0%
part of the state is really struggling
 
03:44:50.910 --> 03:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
it probably will continue to struggle
 
03:44:52.189 --> 03:44:52.199 align:start position:0%
for a long period of time I don't know
 
03:44:53.910 --> 03:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
if you have in looking at data if you
 
03:44:56.070 --> 03:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
have any opinions about that in
 
03:44:57.710 --> 03:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
comparison to the southern part of the
 
03:44:58.830 --> 03:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
state for
 
03:45:02.229 --> 03:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
instance well I mean um I spent 10 years
 
03:45:04.750 --> 03:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
working with waaw papers on their energy
 
03:45:06.670 --> 03:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
policies and trying to get their
 
03:45:08.469 --> 03:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
electric rates down and I remember the
 
03:45:09.830 --> 03:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
day we got the call that they were
 
03:45:12.149 --> 03:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
pulling out completely um which was
 
03:45:13.790 --> 03:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
extremely disappointing and had a lot
 
03:45:15.510 --> 03:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
more to do with the broader
 
03:45:17.830 --> 03:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
industry when you look at the North
 
03:45:21.990 --> 03:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
Country um and I'm not an expert on you
 
03:45:24.030 --> 03:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
know their particular issues and studied
 
03:45:27.990 --> 03:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
it in depth but Top Line it's
 
03:45:31.469 --> 03:45:31.479 align:start position:0%
older um there's more people over 65
 
03:45:33.830 --> 03:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
than the state on average there's more
 
03:45:36.590 --> 03:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
people not in the workforce there's more
 
03:45:39.070 --> 03:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
people in public sector jobs than in
 
03:45:42.910 --> 03:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
private sector jobs um and so it it it's
 
03:45:45.990 --> 03:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
a challenging labor force environment
 
03:45:47.950 --> 03:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
because it is an aging
 
03:45:51.429 --> 03:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
population um and I think that makes it
 
03:45:52.990 --> 03:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
challenging because right now you know
 
03:45:55.349 --> 03:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
housing has gone up there but it is more
 
03:45:57.830 --> 03:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
affordable so you than other parts of
 
03:45:59.309 --> 03:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
the state so why aren't more people
 
03:46:01.510 --> 03:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
moving to the North Country if housing
 
03:46:03.030 --> 03:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
is more affordable now there has been
 
03:46:06.070 --> 03:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
some bump there has been some successes
 
03:46:07.710 --> 03:46:07.720 align:start position:0%
in the North country and I think that's
 
03:46:10.070 --> 03:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
great and ex exciting but when you look
 
03:46:11.269 --> 03:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
at sort of the
 
03:46:14.349 --> 03:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
fundamentals of high energy costs really
 
03:46:17.469 --> 03:46:17.479 align:start position:0%
far to tr uh to travel so if you're
 
03:46:19.070 --> 03:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
producing something and Manufacturing
 
03:46:20.389 --> 03:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
you got to get on the road and get down
 
03:46:22.389 --> 03:46:22.399 align:start position:0%
into the bigger markets it's that much
 
03:46:24.550 --> 03:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
farther to go you've seen some
 
03:46:28.229 --> 03:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
challenges with um tourism that's really
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
far north because it's so far away but I
 
03:46:32.269 --> 03:46:32.279 align:start position:0%
think when you look at the population it
 
03:46:35.510 --> 03:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
is a challenging population to uh bring
 
03:46:38.030 --> 03:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
in um a new Workforce but I think you
 
03:46:39.710 --> 03:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
know there are some bright spots there
 
03:46:41.670 --> 03:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
and I think we're all hope hopeful and
 
03:46:43.189 --> 03:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
there has been some turnaround I think
 
03:46:45.349 --> 03:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
there'll be more but I don't think right
 
03:46:48.990 --> 03:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
to work um anything that the data
 
03:46:52.189 --> 03:46:52.199 align:start position:0%
suggests that that's going to um do
 
03:46:54.790 --> 03:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
anything to change for the positive to
 
03:46:56.389 --> 03:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
start attracting businesses when the
 
03:46:58.710 --> 03:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
lead issues are don't have to do with
 
03:47:00.110 --> 03:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
rights of work they have to do with sort
 
03:47:01.990 --> 03:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
of some fundamental challenges that
 
03:47:03.429 --> 03:47:03.439 align:start position:0%
they're that they're working
 
03:47:06.550 --> 03:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
on okay thank you so
 
03:47:08.550 --> 03:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
much all right thank you ma'am I
 
03:47:10.469 --> 03:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time and your
 
03:47:12.990 --> 03:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
testimony and uhu can we have John web
 
03:47:13.000 --> 03:47:16.750 align:start position:0%
testimony and uhu can we have John web
please

03:47:16.750 --> 03:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:26.030 --> 03:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:29.590 --> 03:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
nashii how are you sir good how are you
 
03:47:31.189 --> 03:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh so my name is John the web I prepared
 
03:47:33.349 --> 03:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
something but it's been reinstated many
 
03:47:35.269 --> 03:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
many many times uh I'm the training
 
03:47:37.590 --> 03:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
director of ibw local 490 I run our
 
03:47:40.309 --> 03:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship um I'm just going to add
 
03:47:41.750 --> 03:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
the little look a little bit been
 
03:47:43.750 --> 03:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
nonunion for 10 years I've been Union
 
03:47:45.469 --> 03:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
for 10 years I join join the union
 
03:47:46.670 --> 03:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
because of the things that provided me
 
03:47:48.790 --> 03:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
that I could not get nonunion I could
 
03:47:50.429 --> 03:47:50.439 align:start position:0%
not get good healthare that didn't cost
 
03:47:52.910 --> 03:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
me a ton I could not get retirement
 
03:47:53.950 --> 03:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
those are the things that I came to the
 
03:47:56.149 --> 03:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
union for and it's benefited me greatly
 
03:47:58.950 --> 03:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
every year I am seeing over a hundred
 
03:48:01.269 --> 03:48:01.279 align:start position:0%
people apply to our apprenticeship I
 
03:48:03.189 --> 03:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
would challenge these non-union
 
03:48:04.990 --> 03:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
contractors to tell me that they have
 
03:48:06.670 --> 03:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
that many applicants beating at their
 
03:48:08.510 --> 03:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
door to get the things that our Union
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
provides our training is free like the
 
03:48:12.630 --> 03:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
other apprenticeships you've heard from
 
03:48:13.910 --> 03:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
and on on top of that we are an
 
03:48:16.070 --> 03:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
organization we are Community this is
 
03:48:18.670 --> 03:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
not just union bosses taking money this
 
03:48:20.389 --> 03:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
is people supporting people this is
 
03:48:21.910 --> 03:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
people caring about people helping them
 
03:48:23.790 --> 03:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
get through their rough times there is a
 
03:48:25.269 --> 03:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
personal connection within this
 
03:48:27.429 --> 03:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
organization and it is hard to get
 
03:48:30.110 --> 03:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
outside of that on top of that people
 
03:48:31.990 --> 03:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
within the unions get paid more and it
 
03:48:34.910 --> 03:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
covers more than what our union dues
 
03:48:36.590 --> 03:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
cost so to act like this is some kind of
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
financial burden on these people is just
 
03:48:42.510 --> 03:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
a completely misleading thing um to the
 
03:48:44.790 --> 03:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
people that spoke earlier I just had a
 
03:48:46.429 --> 03:48:46.439 align:start position:0%
couple comments about that someone said
 
03:48:48.710 --> 03:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
that 80% of their organization and the
 
03:48:51.950 --> 03:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
companies within don't want to be Union
 
03:48:54.070 --> 03:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
they they like right to work then
 
03:48:55.910 --> 03:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're they don't have to worry about
 
03:48:57.389 --> 03:48:57.399 align:start position:0%
the union they're not going to unionize
 
03:48:58.910 --> 03:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
if they have 80% people that are in
 
03:49:01.429 --> 03:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
favor of for right to work um workers
 
03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
who claim to support the right to work
 
03:49:06.189 --> 03:49:06.199 align:start position:0%
the actual workers um I believe they're
 
03:49:07.670 --> 03:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
doing so out of fear for repercussions
 
03:49:09.070 --> 03:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
for the companies that are giving them
 
03:49:10.590 --> 03:49:10.600 align:start position:0%
these surveys within their companies and
 
03:49:11.950 --> 03:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
I believe that they're doing because
 
03:49:13.149 --> 03:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
they're being misled they're being told
 
03:49:14.710 --> 03:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
the union will do nothing for them but
 
03:49:16.469 --> 03:49:16.479 align:start position:0%
take their money which is again just
 
03:49:20.070 --> 03:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
blatantly false uh and if there are so
 
03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
many workers that are dying to have
 
03:49:24.110 --> 03:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
right to work past that they don't have
 
03:49:26.110 --> 03:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
to pay dues like where are they everyone
 
03:49:28.349 --> 03:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
here that is pro right to work is being
 
03:49:31.229 --> 03:49:31.239 align:start position:0%
paid to be here for the most part uh in
 
03:49:33.309 --> 03:49:33.319 align:start position:0%
the meantime you have dozens and dozens
 
03:49:34.910 --> 03:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
and dozens and dozens of people here on
 
03:49:36.429 --> 03:49:36.439 align:start position:0%
their own time taking a day off from
 
03:49:39.510 --> 03:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
work and sacrificing money to be here to
 
03:49:42.070 --> 03:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
fight against it in fear that this union
 
03:49:44.110 --> 03:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
busting bill is going to affect us in
 
03:49:46.229 --> 03:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
the future that our fund our Union is
 
03:49:48.550 --> 03:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
going to be defunded through this and
 
03:49:49.630 --> 03:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
then the people who actually want to be
 
03:49:51.229 --> 03:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
in a union won't have a union to be a
 
03:49:55.269 --> 03:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
part of so that's my uh non-prepared
 
03:49:58.469 --> 03:49:58.479 align:start position:0%
statement that was uh very good thank
 
03:49:58.479 --> 03:50:00.429 align:start position:0%
statement that was uh very good thank
you

03:50:00.429 --> 03:50:00.439 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:50:02.189 --> 03:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
questions yes
 
03:50:05.110 --> 03:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
ma'am thank you for taking my question
 
03:50:09.070 --> 03:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
um are there um are there enough
 
03:50:12.269 --> 03:50:12.279 align:start position:0%
electricians and the other question is
 
03:50:16.990 --> 03:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:19.510 --> 03:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh there is electricity everywhere
 
03:50:21.670 --> 03:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
electric cars renewable energies
 
03:50:22.990 --> 03:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
everything is being more and more and
 
03:50:24.830 --> 03:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
more electrified more and more and more
 
03:50:26.030 --> 03:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
and even the buildings that already
 
03:50:27.469 --> 03:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
exist need to be retrofitted and
 
03:50:29.950 --> 03:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
upgraded with LED lighting or the next
 
03:50:31.670 --> 03:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
type of lighting or the next type of USB
 
03:50:33.910 --> 03:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
charging or whatever electricity is in
 
03:50:36.910 --> 03:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
more demand uh AI demands more power for
 
03:50:38.990 --> 03:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
their servers power distributions a huge
 
03:50:41.510 --> 03:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
issue we need electricians desperately
 
03:50:42.990 --> 03:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
and to my knowledge we are losing them
 
03:50:44.990 --> 03:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
more than we are gaining them because
 
03:50:46.389 --> 03:50:46.399 align:start position:0%
people have been told that trade work
 
03:50:49.590 --> 03:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
isn't profitable if you're in a union it
 
03:50:51.389 --> 03:50:51.399 align:start position:0%
is profitable and not only can you make
 
03:50:53.429 --> 03:50:53.439 align:start position:0%
good money but you can retire I was
 
03:50:54.790 --> 03:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
going to work myself into the grave
 
03:50:56.429 --> 03:50:56.439 align:start position:0%
before I was in the union and I'm now
 
03:50:58.950 --> 03:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to retire and that is such
 
03:51:00.790 --> 03:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
relief and those are the kind of things
 
03:51:02.750 --> 03:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
that we need to extend to the younger
 
03:51:04.550 --> 03:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
generations to encourage them to go into
 
03:51:06.630 --> 03:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
these trades which build this country
 
03:51:07.830 --> 03:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
and are the infrastructure of this
 
03:51:09.189 --> 03:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
country we will not survive as a country
 
03:51:10.950 --> 03:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
without Tradesmen doing the work and
 
03:51:12.670 --> 03:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
they have to be compensated they have to
 
03:51:14.149 --> 03:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
be treated medically they have to get
 
03:51:15.630 --> 03:51:15.640 align:start position:0%
retirement and they have to get training
 
03:51:16.910 --> 03:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
03:51:19.950 --> 03:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
exist may I some follow up yes ma'am
 
03:51:24.309 --> 03:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um my other question is um
 
03:51:26.630 --> 03:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
once you become a licensed electrician
 
03:51:28.349 --> 03:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
and go through your training are you
 
03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
required then to work in a union shop no
 
03:51:34.149 --> 03:51:34.159 align:start position:0%
we have people that join our Union and
 
03:51:35.550 --> 03:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
they leave mid apprenticeship for a
 
03:51:36.910 --> 03:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons we have people that
 
03:51:38.189 --> 03:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
join our Union and leave after their
 
03:51:39.269 --> 03:51:39.279 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship and we have people that
 
03:51:41.349 --> 03:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
join our Union and retire in our Union
 
03:51:42.710 --> 03:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
they are at free to do whatever they
 
03:51:44.790 --> 03:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
want there are plenty and plenty of
 
03:51:46.910 --> 03:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
non-union contractors to work for some
 
03:51:48.510 --> 03:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
treat you well and give you similar
 
03:51:51.030 --> 03:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
benefits some do not in my experience
 
03:51:52.309 --> 03:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
the past 10 years have been the most
 
03:51:54.349 --> 03:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
beneficial 10 years of my career as an
 
03:51:56.790 --> 03:51:56.800 align:start position:0%

legislation being proposed in New
 
03:53:59.750 --> 03:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as I believe it will have
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
negative consequences for workers
 
03:54:04.309 --> 03:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
businesses and the state's
 
03:54:06.990 --> 03:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
economy my name is Eric Bachelor and I
 
03:54:08.870 --> 03:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
live in Farmington New Hampshire and I
 
03:54:11.189 --> 03:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
started my electrical career in New
 
03:54:13.550 --> 03:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with one of the largest and
 
03:54:15.870 --> 03:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
very well-known non-union contractors in
 
03:54:15.880 --> 03:54:17.349 align:start position:0%
very well-known non-union contractors in
the

03:54:17.349 --> 03:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:54:20.670 --> 03:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
state my starting wage was $6 an
 
03:54:22.950 --> 03:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
hour which was the minimum wage at the
 
03:54:24.870 --> 03:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
time in
 
03:54:27.510 --> 03:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
1997 even at that time it wasn't a lot
 
03:54:30.910 --> 03:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
of money and I needed a second part-time
 
03:54:33.429 --> 03:54:33.439 align:start position:0%
job which actually paid higher than what
 
03:54:35.510 --> 03:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
I was getting as an electrical
 
03:54:37.349 --> 03:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
Apprentice I couldn't afford their
 
03:54:40.670 --> 03:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
health benefits because it was $6 an
 
03:54:42.990 --> 03:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
hour I certainly couldn't get into their
 
03:54:48.750 --> 03:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
retirement their 41 k plan because $6 an
 
03:54:51.910 --> 03:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
hour I was newly married and I had a
 
03:54:55.469 --> 03:54:55.479 align:start position:0%
child I needed something better I wasn't
 
03:54:57.429 --> 03:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
forced to join the union it was my
 
03:55:00.510 --> 03:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
choice to pay the dues back then and now
 
03:55:03.070 --> 03:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
I'm still glad to give the small amount
 
03:55:06.389 --> 03:55:06.399 align:start position:0%
of money that is asked of me for all the
 
03:55:09.670 --> 03:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
union has given me um and the rest of my
 
03:55:12.269 --> 03:55:12.279 align:start position:0%
members it has given me Financial
 
03:55:14.870 --> 03:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
Freedom top shelf Healthcare
 
03:55:17.349 --> 03:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
in a retirement that is to be
 
03:55:19.910 --> 03:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
envied it has given me an education
 
03:55:21.469 --> 03:55:21.479 align:start position:0%
through a registered
 
03:55:23.349 --> 03:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship and as a licensed
 
03:55:25.309 --> 03:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
electrician continued education by
 
03:55:27.349 --> 03:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
offering classes in areas I may have
 
03:55:30.750 --> 03:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
little experience in or on new emerging
 
03:55:32.790 --> 03:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
Technologies the best part of this
 
03:55:35.269 --> 03:55:35.279 align:start position:0%
education it has no out of pocket
 
03:55:38.469 --> 03:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
expenses to me or to the state or to
 
03:55:38.479 --> 03:55:39.750 align:start position:0%
expenses to me or to the state or to
Federal

03:55:39.750 --> 03:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
Federal

that our contractors still provide
 
03:55:55.269 --> 03:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
customers with competitive bids against
 
03:55:58.149 --> 03:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
open shops who do not provide a portion

move if I don't want to pay dues I can
 
03:56:20.830 --> 03:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
go work somewhere else we do not need
 
03:56:23.110 --> 03:56:23.120 align:start position:0%

bridge the gap between the two the best
 
03:56:51.110 --> 03:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
part of this is like you if my members
 
03:56:53.790 --> 03:56:53.800 align:start position:0%

chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:57:05.790 --> 03:57:05.800 align:start position:0%
question do you think that people who do
 
03:57:07.149 --> 03:57:07.159 align:start position:0%
not want to be in a union should lose
 
03:57:07.159 --> 03:57:08.670 align:start position:0%
not want to be in a union should lose
their

03:57:08.670 --> 03:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:57:10.510 --> 03:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
job if they don't want to be in the
 
03:57:12.750 --> 03:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
union I don't think they would be at our
 
03:57:14.910 --> 03:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
doorstep they come to our doorstep
 
03:57:16.750 --> 03:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
because they want to be part of that
 
03:57:20.630 --> 03:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
Union thank you sure okay represent kale
 
03:57:21.910 --> 03:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:57:25.309 --> 03:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh yesterday we had a
 
03:57:28.110 --> 03:57:28.120 align:start position:0%
hearing and we learned about uh an area
 
03:57:29.910 --> 03:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
where the business Community is getting
 
03:57:32.269 --> 03:57:32.279 align:start position:0%
a really good deal it's uh unemployment
 
03:57:34.349 --> 03:57:34.359 align:start position:0%
insurance which you know it's it's hard
 
03:57:35.950 --> 03:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
to compete with that good a deal for
 
03:57:39.030 --> 03:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
what they get for $84 a year and it
 
03:57:40.830 --> 03:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
sounds to me am I correct in the
 
03:57:42.070 --> 03:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
understanding what I've heard from the
 
03:57:44.229 --> 03:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
other union members that rather the
 
03:57:46.189 --> 03:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
paying union dues or agency fees you're
 
03:57:47.670 --> 03:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
getting a lot for your
 
03:57:50.870 --> 03:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
money absolutely um I mean I'm going
 
03:57:52.910 --> 03:57:52.920 align:start position:0%

to
 
03:59:58.830 --> 03:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
um the branch of the ibw that I
 
04:00:02.110 --> 04:00:02.120 align:start position:0%
represent is construction and I also
 
04:00:05.070 --> 04:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
represent the manufacturing industry uh
 
04:00:09.349 --> 04:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
in Maine which primarily are the uh uh
 
04:00:12.070 --> 04:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
four paper mills that I represent up in
 
04:00:18.189 --> 04:00:18.199 align:start position:0%

Westbrook and we work with the employers
 
04:00:25.189 --> 04:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
but the whole foundation of the ibw had
 
04:00:26.870 --> 04:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with all these finances
 
04:00:28.469 --> 04:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
and and who's making more money and
 
04:00:30.590 --> 04:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
who's this and that it was about
 
04:00:33.309 --> 04:00:33.319 align:start position:0%
safety construction is a dangerous
 
04:00:37.670 --> 04:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
dangerous industry and our unions work
 
04:00:38.910 --> 04:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
with our
 
04:00:42.070 --> 04:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
employers and we come up with all kinds
 
04:00:44.349 --> 04:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
of safety safety issues and safety
 
04:00:46.309 --> 04:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
procedures and protection of our
 
04:00:48.750 --> 04:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
membership is our number one priority
 
04:00:51.710 --> 04:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
always has been when I ran the local
 
04:00:54.110 --> 04:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
union here in New Hampshire that was our
 
04:00:56.110 --> 04:00:56.120 align:start position:0%
priority and that's where we spent a
 
04:00:59.429 --> 04:00:59.439 align:start position:0%
great deal of our time on and statistics
 
04:01:03.309 --> 04:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
prove right so Department of Labor uh
 
04:01:07.990 --> 04:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
show that um 19% Union construction work
 
04:01:10.189 --> 04:01:10.199 align:start position:0%
sites are less likely to have an oosha
 
04:01:15.229 --> 04:01:15.239 align:start position:0%
violation and 34% fewer violations
 
04:01:18.550 --> 04:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh per inspection than on the non-union
 
04:01:23.830 --> 04:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
work sites now we only represent 14% of
 
04:01:26.309 --> 04:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
the industry right so
 
04:01:29.349 --> 04:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
14% of the construction industry
 
04:01:31.870 --> 04:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
nationally and less here in New
 
04:01:33.149 --> 04:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I can tell you exactly what it
 
04:01:33.159 --> 04:01:34.030 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I can tell you exactly what it
is

04:01:34.030 --> 04:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:01:40.070 --> 04:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
9% um is represented by unions all right
 
04:01:44.630 --> 04:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
so there's 90 something per 91%
 
04:01:46.870 --> 04:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
of the shops here in the state of New
 
04:01:48.790 --> 04:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are non-union Construction
 
04:01:51.229 --> 04:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
Industries and private private
 
04:01:53.990 --> 04:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
construction there are a number of
 
04:01:56.590 --> 04:01:56.600 align:start position:0%

behalf of my membership as well as a
 
04:04:41.750 --> 04:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
list of contractors that you see on the
 
04:04:44.349 --> 04:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
second page of the pack that I gave you
 
04:04:47.469 --> 04:04:47.479 align:start position:0%
um I'm here uh today to to try to
 
04:04:48.630 --> 04:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
protect Working Families in New
 
04:04:50.870 --> 04:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by asking to vote no on House
 
04:04:52.630 --> 04:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 238 right to
 
04:04:54.670 --> 04:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
work um we've been hearing a ton of
 
04:04:56.349 --> 04:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
Statistics today um the thing about
 
04:04:57.990 --> 04:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
statistics is that depending on what
 
04:04:59.149 --> 04:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
you're trying to find you can kind of
 
04:05:01.510 --> 04:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
skew the data usually to to try to you
 
04:05:04.349 --> 04:05:04.359 align:start position:0%
know make your own argument right um but
 
04:05:06.149 --> 04:05:06.159 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll I'll jump into that as well a
 
04:05:08.030 --> 04:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
little bit so on average right to work
 
04:05:10.830 --> 04:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
states have a poverty level of 11.2%
 
04:05:12.309 --> 04:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
compared to New Hampshire's
 
04:05:14.710 --> 04:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
3.7% um I also like to just point out
 
04:05:16.349 --> 04:05:16.359 align:start position:0%
for a second I can't keep my mouth shut
 
04:05:17.950 --> 04:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
about this the thought that New
 
04:05:19.790 --> 04:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has catching up to do to be on
 
04:05:22.229 --> 04:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
par with West Virginia a state that
 
04:05:25.229 --> 04:05:25.239 align:start position:0%
Trails the bottom the bottom list of
 
04:05:26.870 --> 04:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
rankings of every state pretty much for
 
04:05:28.510 --> 04:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
every metric that determines whether or
 
04:05:31.990 --> 04:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
not a state is healthy or not um you
 
04:05:33.309 --> 04:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
know ju just for the record West
 
04:05:35.349 --> 04:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
Virginia actually has a poverty rate of
 
04:05:37.349 --> 04:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
16.7% Which is higher than the national
 
04:05:39.830 --> 04:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
average of 11.2% and much higher than
 
04:05:42.070 --> 04:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's average of
 
04:05:44.950 --> 04:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
3.7% um
 
04:05:46.630 --> 04:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
so this is due largely to the fact that
 
04:05:47.950 --> 04:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
all working people in right to work
 
04:05:50.630 --> 04:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
states Union and non-union earn 12% less
 
04:05:52.110 --> 04:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
than working people in nonight to work
 
04:05:53.910 --> 04:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
states working people are also
 
04:05:55.590 --> 04:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
significantly less safe at work in right
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
to work states with incidents of
 
04:05:59.269 --> 04:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
workplace fatalities being
 
04:06:01.750 --> 04:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
43.8% higher than in non-right to work
 
04:06:04.469 --> 04:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
states as a working person a husband a
 
04:06:06.269 --> 04:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
father and a granite stator these are
 
04:06:08.590 --> 04:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
not conditions that we can accept in New
 
04:06:11.510 --> 04:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I'd also like to kind of
 
04:06:13.389 --> 04:06:13.399 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit uh to the people that
 
04:06:16.750 --> 04:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
do support this bill um you know I'd
 
04:06:17.790 --> 04:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
like you to take a look at the people
 
04:06:19.070 --> 04:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
that are coming in here today the people
 
04:06:21.710 --> 04:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
that are testifying uh in favor of this
 
04:06:22.990 --> 04:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
bill but also the people that are
 
04:06:26.110 --> 04:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
testifying against it um I think that
 
04:06:27.309 --> 04:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
you'll realize that the people that are
 
04:06:29.030 --> 04:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
coming in to speak against it with the
 
04:06:30.590 --> 04:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
people that you want living in your
 
04:06:33.790 --> 04:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
communities so um working people join a
 
04:06:36.030 --> 04:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
union because quite often it's the first
 
04:06:37.670 --> 04:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
real accessible opportunity that we've
 
04:06:39.630 --> 04:06:39.640 align:start position:0%
ever gotten for Upward Mobility like
 
04:06:40.990 --> 04:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
every state New Hampshire's facing some
 
04:06:42.710 --> 04:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
real difficult challenges right now
 
04:06:44.630 --> 04:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
housing crisis homelessness substance
 
04:06:47.349 --> 04:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
abuse and right to work is attacking the
 
04:06:49.510 --> 04:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
very best vehicle that we have to combat
 
04:06:51.269 --> 04:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
these issues which is unionism Union
 
04:06:53.830 --> 04:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
membership a Union contract takes a job
 
04:06:55.149 --> 04:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
and turns it into a career by
 
04:06:57.189 --> 04:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing working conditions wages
 
04:06:59.630 --> 04:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
benefits and a dignified retirement pay
 
04:07:01.550 --> 04:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
attention to how pay attention to how
 
04:07:03.510 --> 04:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
many people show up to oppose us today
 
04:07:05.389 --> 04:07:05.399 align:start position:0%
and pay attention to who we are if you
 
04:07:06.870 --> 04:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
pay attention I think you'll see that we
 
04:07:08.790 --> 04:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
are New Hampshire's homeowners business
 
04:07:11.790 --> 04:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
owners taxpayers voters and the proud
 
04:07:13.030 --> 04:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
working men and women that keep our
 
04:07:16.110 --> 04:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
communities going in closing working uh
 
04:07:17.670 --> 04:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
working people benefit from from
 
04:07:19.229 --> 04:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
belonging to a union and the communities
 
04:07:21.389 --> 04:07:21.399 align:start position:0%
that we live in benefit from us living
 
04:07:25.550 --> 04:07:25.560 align:start position:0%

who belonged to her local union for more

than three and a half decades so I
 
04:10:10.990 --> 04:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
understand firsthand the Union's role in
 
04:10:13.990 --> 04:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
building a middle class and a families
 
04:10:14.000 --> 04:10:14.750 align:start position:0%
building a middle class and a families
like

04:10:14.750 --> 04:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:10:17.389 --> 04:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
mine a union fought so that my mother's
 
04:10:19.189 --> 04:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
work was fairly valued when balanced
 
04:10:21.309 --> 04:10:21.319 align:start position:0%
with her employer interests and a union
 
04:10:23.070 --> 04:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
provided strong legal protections for
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
her and her colleagues at their
 
04:10:28.109 --> 04:10:28.119 align:start position:0%
workplace a union provided strong legal
 
04:10:30.149 --> 04:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
protections for them in their workplace
 
04:10:32.510 --> 04:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
but they also negot negotiated stronger
 
04:10:32.520 --> 04:10:34.149 align:start position:0%
but they also negot negotiated stronger
worker

04:10:34.149 --> 04:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
worker
 
04:10:36.590 --> 04:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
benefits um upon which she and our whole
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
family thrived whether it was her
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
vacation or sick time or health
 
04:10:43.309 --> 04:10:43.319 align:start position:0%
insurance uh her retirement or her
 
04:10:44.950 --> 04:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
professional development support or
 
04:10:47.109 --> 04:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
other employment rights so my life was
 
04:10:48.990 --> 04:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
built upon this Union and I could not be
 
04:10:51.030 --> 04:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
more proud of her decision to join that
 
04:10:52.670 --> 04:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
Union back in the
 
04:10:54.910 --> 04:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
1970s since we just celebrated the
 
04:10:57.030 --> 04:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
Martin Luther King Day holiday on Monday
 
04:10:59.109 --> 04:10:59.119 align:start position:0%
it's worth noting that Dr King reminded
 
04:11:00.990 --> 04:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
us that right to work laws are
 
04:11:03.590 --> 04:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
historically rooted in racism and
 
04:11:05.550 --> 04:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
designed to maintain unequal power in
 
04:11:08.149 --> 04:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
the workplace Dr King called the right
 
04:11:09.910 --> 04:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
to work a false
 
04:11:12.429 --> 04:11:12.439 align:start position:0%
slogan um since right to work laws
 
04:11:15.149 --> 04:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
provide neither rights nor work uh and
 
04:11:17.309 --> 04:11:17.319 align:start position:0%
are in fact designed to Rob workers of
 
04:11:19.309 --> 04:11:19.319 align:start position:0%
their civil rights and job rights and to
 
04:11:21.910 --> 04:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
destroy labor unions and the freedom of
 
04:11:23.630 --> 04:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining by which those
 
04:11:25.630 --> 04:11:25.640 align:start position:0%
unions have improved wages and working
 
04:11:28.429 --> 04:11:28.439 align:start position:0%
conditions of everyone to be clear the
 
04:11:31.790 --> 04:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
effect of passage of n of HB 238 in New
 
04:11:33.990 --> 04:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will be that it will lead to
 
04:11:36.990 --> 04:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
union busting depreciated workers value
 
04:11:39.030 --> 04:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
and workplace negotiations and a
 
04:11:40.670 --> 04:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
degradation of middle class family
 
04:11:43.349 --> 04:11:43.359 align:start position:0%
strength but right to work harms much
 
04:11:45.309 --> 04:11:45.319 align:start position:0%
more than the individual worker or the
 
04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
hardworking middle class family right to
 
04:11:50.550 --> 04:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
work harms the general public in states
 
04:11:53.149 --> 04:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
where it's passed as we've heard
 
04:11:55.710 --> 04:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
today according to in fact according to
 
04:11:57.630 --> 04:11:57.640 align:start position:0%
the E Economic Policy Institute a
 
04:11:59.630 --> 04:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
nonprofit nonpartisan
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
organization and their study data shows
 
04:12:04.750 --> 04:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
that anti-union right to work laws
 
04:12:06.990 --> 04:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
damage State economies because these
 
04:12:09.229 --> 04:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
laws lead to lower unionization rates
 
04:12:10.870 --> 04:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
wages and benefits when compared to
 
04:12:13.469 --> 04:12:13.479 align:start position:0%
states without such legislation so
 
04:12:14.670 --> 04:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
claims that the Right to Work
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
legislation we're contemplating today
 
04:12:18.870 --> 04:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
will lead to Greater job growth simply
 
04:12:21.109 --> 04:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
as misleading and
 
04:12:23.590 --> 04:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
inaccurate the Epi study shows that
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
there are no measurable employment
 
04:12:27.269 --> 04:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
advantages between right to work and
 
04:12:30.670 --> 04:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
non-right to work states so who benefits
 
04:12:32.550 --> 04:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
the answer is Mega corporations
 
04:12:34.630 --> 04:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
corporate shareholders and the rich by
 
04:12:36.670 --> 04:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
providing greater monetary profits
 
04:12:38.990 --> 04:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
further exacerbating the wealth Gap here
 
04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so please join the
 
04:12:43.349 --> 04:12:43.359 align:start position:0%
hardworking Granite State families who
 
04:12:46.750 --> 04:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
reject HB 238 and I urge you to vote itl
 
04:12:48.070 --> 04:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
when your committee reaches that
 
04:12:49.870 --> 04:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
executive session later today if that
 
04:12:51.830 --> 04:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
does in fact happen thank you for your

who are here to speak I just am going to
 
04:12:57.550 --> 04:12:57.560 align:start position:0%

time thank you ma'am appreciate your

1984 um and I'm here opposing uh right
 
04:13:59.469 --> 04:13:59.479 align:start position:0%
to work um for my personal experience I
 
04:14:02.349 --> 04:14:02.359 align:start position:0%
want to say that I have earned more
 
04:14:04.790 --> 04:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
money working in public schools than I
 
04:14:07.870 --> 04:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
have in private schools and part of that
 
04:14:11.710 --> 04:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
is uh somebody was mentioned that oh I
 
04:14:14.550 --> 04:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
could have uh negotiated for
 
04:14:17.389 --> 04:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
my and in a private school I could have
 
04:14:22.349 --> 04:14:22.359 align:start position:0%
done that but I was a young I was female
 
04:14:24.590 --> 04:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
there weren't as there were more male
 
04:14:26.630 --> 04:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
teachers than there were female teachers
 
04:14:30.630 --> 04:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
and I didn't have I didn't have the shpa
 
04:14:34.070 --> 04:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
maybe to uh negotiate for myself in that
 
04:14:36.790 --> 04:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
in that same way um when I moved to
 
04:14:39.950 --> 04:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
teaching in a public school I was paid
 
04:14:43.830 --> 04:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
according to my my education my
 
04:14:47.670 --> 04:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
experience and I knew I could see the uh
 
04:14:50.229 --> 04:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
pay scale I knew that men and women were
 
04:14:52.309 --> 04:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
both paid the same I couldn't say that
 
04:14:54.750 --> 04:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
that was true my previous
 
04:14:59.189 --> 04:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
employment also I wanted to say that um
 
04:15:04.309 --> 04:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
later in my career um there was a I was
 
04:15:07.469 --> 04:15:07.479 align:start position:0%
inappropriately re um lost my job due to
 
04:15:11.389 --> 04:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
reduction and force that the um School
 
04:15:13.990 --> 04:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
District had applied in a appropriately
 
04:15:16.790 --> 04:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
and it was the union that helped me to
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
get my job back and since my family
 
04:15:22.389 --> 04:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
relied on my wages and by benefits we
 
04:15:24.710 --> 04:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
were all very grateful for that
 
04:15:26.990 --> 04:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
support a couple other things i' just
 
04:15:29.550 --> 04:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
like to say one is uh we've heard about
 
04:15:35.189 --> 04:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
the right to work has um comes from a a
 
04:15:37.269 --> 04:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
racist background I'd like to just say a
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
little bit more about that the laws
 
04:15:42.309 --> 04:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
bubbled up in the Jim Crow South in the
 
04:15:45.429 --> 04:15:45.439 align:start position:0%
194 40s and Beyond and these laws were
 
04:15:47.429 --> 04:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
all about trying to put a divide between
 
04:15:49.349 --> 04:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
black workers and white workers when
 
04:15:51.269 --> 04:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
there was any hint that they might work
 
04:15:53.550 --> 04:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
together to unionize and one of the key
 
04:15:55.229 --> 04:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
architects of this law was a wealthy
 
04:15:57.229 --> 04:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
industrialist and lobbyist from Texas
 
04:16:00.030 --> 04:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
named Vance Muse and his literature
 
04:16:02.550 --> 04:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
proposing so-called right to work laws
 
04:16:05.189 --> 04:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
he wrote and please forgive these
 
04:16:07.910 --> 04:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
disgraceful words that if right to work
 
04:16:11.229 --> 04:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
laws were not passed quote white men and
 
04:16:13.590 --> 04:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
women would be forced to into
 
04:16:16.229 --> 04:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
organizations meaning unions with black
 
04:16:18.510 --> 04:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
African Apes whom they will have to call
 
04:16:21.630 --> 04:16:21.640 align:start position:0%
brother and lose their jobs end of quote
 
04:16:24.030 --> 04:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
um I've mentioned in my testimony which
 
04:16:27.269 --> 04:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
I submitted through the portal that not
 
04:16:29.590 --> 04:16:29.600 align:start position:0%

trans people don't necessarily find when
 
04:17:44.070 --> 04:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
we Face unequal employment and economic
 
04:17:49.309 --> 04:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh we and when we also see
 
04:17:53.109 --> 04:17:53.119 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the all levels of
 
04:17:56.109 --> 04:17:56.119 align:start position:0%
government targeting our
 
04:18:00.510 --> 04:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
rights it comes down to the so for me it
 
04:18:02.469 --> 04:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
comes down to the solidarity I find in
 
04:18:06.269 --> 04:18:06.279 align:start position:0%
my local union hall knowing that it
 
04:18:08.830 --> 04:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter where the direction of
 
04:18:12.469 --> 04:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
politics goes that I have a place and I
 
04:18:16.630 --> 04:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
have a future in my hall and the right

to work H bills fundamentally
 
04:18:24.830 --> 04:18:24.840 align:start position:0%

have been brought up since um hearing
 
04:19:13.030 --> 04:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
some of these things today new Hampshire
 
04:19:16.030 --> 04:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
is number 21 in growth for um current
 
04:19:18.910 --> 04:19:18.920 align:start position:0%

healthc Care
 
04:19:33.550 --> 04:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
Union um I was a strong supporter of
 
04:19:36.309 --> 04:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
unions in the 70s and 80s I marched
 
04:19:39.950 --> 04:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
along right along with a lot of those um
 
04:19:41.790 --> 04:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
folks that felt they were being
 
04:19:44.510 --> 04:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
discriminated in the workplace I have
 
04:19:46.550 --> 04:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
been both a union member of five
 
04:19:48.910 --> 04:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
different unions and a non-union member
 
04:19:50.910 --> 04:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
during my more than 40 Years of
 
04:19:53.349 --> 04:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
employment that being said I am
 
04:19:55.750 --> 04:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill today for what it
 
04:19:59.149 --> 04:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
is it is the choice it is not a Right to
 
04:20:02.030 --> 04:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
Work bill it is not a Jim Crow law bill
 
04:20:05.389 --> 04:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
it is a choice uh during my research and
 
04:20:07.389 --> 04:20:07.399 align:start position:0%
review of the benefits of being a union
 
04:20:10.349 --> 04:20:10.359 align:start position:0%
member and listening time and time again
 
04:20:12.469 --> 04:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
to Union lobbyists speaking out against
 
04:20:14.750 --> 04:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
the very folks that they profess to
 
04:20:17.469 --> 04:20:17.479 align:start position:0%
represent in these hearings and years
 
04:20:19.630 --> 04:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
and years and years of hearing similar
 
04:20:22.670 --> 04:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
to this would you believe that while I
 
04:20:24.710 --> 04:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
was sitting here today listening to all
 
04:20:28.070 --> 04:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
this testimony I developed two questions
 
04:20:31.750 --> 04:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
one how do unions who have come to our
 
04:20:33.710 --> 04:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
work environments and flex their
 
04:20:33.720 --> 04:20:36.710 align:start position:0%
work environments and flex their
financial

04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:39.269 --> 04:20:39.279 align:start position:0%
muscles um putting out healthy
 
04:20:41.950 --> 04:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
competition and and the promotion of
 
04:20:41.960 --> 04:20:43.469 align:start position:0%
competition and and the promotion of
growth

04:20:43.469 --> 04:20:43.479 align:start position:0%
growth
 
04:20:46.870 --> 04:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
capitalism two how are what unions have
 
04:20:50.870 --> 04:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
become today any different from what Dei
 
04:20:53.269 --> 04:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
policy and practices have done to our
 
04:20:55.950 --> 04:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
schools our workplace and our
 
04:21:00.149 --> 04:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
country it is okay for people to be able
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
to to be paid appropriately for what
 
04:21:07.149 --> 04:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
they for what for their job however it
 
04:21:11.910 --> 04:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
is not okay to give everyone the same
 
04:21:11.920 --> 04:21:13.389 align:start position:0%
is not okay to give everyone the same
outcome

04:21:13.389 --> 04:21:13.399 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
04:21:15.910 --> 04:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
this is the land of opportunity not
 
04:21:19.550 --> 04:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
Equity this is the land of you can still
 
04:21:22.950 --> 04:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
have a dream but you have to work for it
 
04:21:25.149 --> 04:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately unions have become a
 
04:21:27.950 --> 04:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
situation today where no one has to work
 
04:21:30.550 --> 04:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
for it anymore it breaks my heart that
 
04:21:33.189 --> 04:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
so many of my union brothers and sisters
 
04:21:36.710 --> 04:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
believe that their employers would still
 
04:21:38.990 --> 04:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
enslave them and behold them to the kind
 
04:21:41.469 --> 04:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
of practices that were happening in the
 
04:21:41.479 --> 04:21:43.469 align:start position:0%
of practices that were happening in the
70s

04:21:43.469 --> 04:21:43.479 align:start position:0%
70s
 
04:21:47.149 --> 04:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
we can do better pass this bill today
 
04:21:48.510 --> 04:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
and let's prove
 
04:21:51.349 --> 04:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
it thank you thank you man' I appreciate
 
04:21:56.149 --> 04:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:58.469 --> 04:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no questions thank you
 
04:22:00.910 --> 04:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your
 
04:22:13.990 --> 04:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:15.269 --> 04:22:15.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:22:18.030 --> 04:22:18.040 align:start position:0%

04:22:19.750 --> 04:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
of the Josiah baret Center for Public
 
04:22:21.469 --> 04:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
Policy New Hampshire's free market Think
 
04:22:23.670 --> 04:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
Tank and we are in support of making New
 
04:22:25.710 --> 04:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the 27th right to work state
 
04:22:28.950 --> 04:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
in the United States for a lot of um
 
04:22:31.630 --> 04:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
prance of economic reasons I know that
 
04:22:33.149 --> 04:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
you've been here a lot long time so I
 
04:22:34.750 --> 04:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
try to be short I'm going to summarize a
 
04:22:36.790 --> 04:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
study that's come up many times in this
 
04:22:38.990 --> 04:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
testimony which is the 2021 Harvard
 
04:22:41.070 --> 04:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
University study that I know has been
 
04:22:42.469 --> 04:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
abanded about but I've got it sort of a
 
04:22:43.590 --> 04:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
summary and the reason we want to
 
04:22:45.630 --> 04:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
mention this study is because it's maybe
 
04:22:47.590 --> 04:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
the most comprehensive study done on
 
04:22:49.990 --> 04:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
right to work laws because of the depth
 
04:22:52.429 --> 04:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
of what they tried to measure so I'm
 
04:22:53.670 --> 04:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
going to go through what some of their
 
04:22:55.189 --> 04:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
findings and just uh representative
 
04:22:56.469 --> 04:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
Sullivan I know you asked this question
 
04:22:58.510 --> 04:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
earlier but to mention the authors of
 
04:23:01.189 --> 04:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
the study Benjamin Austin is a Harvard
 
04:23:03.670 --> 04:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
economics professor his previous paper a
 
04:23:05.670 --> 04:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
large paper he co-authored with Ed
 
04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
Glazer the chairman of the Harvard
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
Economic Department and Lawrence Summers
 
04:23:10.630 --> 04:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
the former treasury secretary under
 
04:23:12.510 --> 04:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
President Clinton um and former
 
04:23:15.910 --> 04:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
president of Harvard not a right-wing uh
 
04:23:17.510 --> 04:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know paid troll or anything like
 
04:23:20.229 --> 04:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
that uh Matthew Lily is also uh Harvard
 
04:23:22.790 --> 04:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
lecturer with studies labor economics
 
04:23:24.070 --> 04:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
their study found and I'll just
 
04:23:25.870 --> 04:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
summarize it really
 
04:23:27.990 --> 04:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
quickly increase in employment
 
04:23:30.349 --> 04:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
population so what they did just they
 
04:23:32.710 --> 04:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
studied border counties in uh states
 
04:23:34.109 --> 04:23:34.119 align:start position:0%
where one state went right to work and
 
04:23:37.229 --> 04:23:37.239 align:start position:0%
one state did not go right to
 
04:23:39.830 --> 04:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
work increase employment to population
 
04:23:41.070 --> 04:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
ratios which is the percentage of the
 
04:23:42.550 --> 04:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
working age population who are are
 
04:23:46.109 --> 04:23:46.119 align:start position:0%
employed by 3 and2 percentage points
 
04:23:50.349 --> 04:23:50.359 align:start position:0%
increase manufacturing employment by
 
04:23:53.710 --> 04:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
28% increase total employment by 1.6
 
04:23:56.149 --> 04:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
percentage points increase labor force
 
04:23:59.349 --> 04:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
participation rate by 1 14 1.4
 
04:23:59.359 --> 04:24:00.429 align:start position:0%
participation rate by 1 14 1.4
percentage

04:24:00.429 --> 04:24:00.439 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
04:24:02.429 --> 04:24:02.439 align:start position:0%
points and then I think we're getting
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
into some really interesting findings
 
04:24:05.469 --> 04:24:05.479 align:start position:0%
here which most other studies do not
 
04:24:05.479 --> 04:24:06.189 align:start position:0%
here which most other studies do not
look

04:24:06.189 --> 04:24:06.199 align:start position:0%
look
 
04:24:06.199 --> 04:24:07.990 align:start position:0%
look
for

04:24:07.990 --> 04:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:24:10.469 --> 04:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
reduce the share of individuals below
 
04:24:13.189 --> 04:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
the federal poverty level by 1.4
 
04:24:15.389 --> 04:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
percentage points reduced childhood
 
04:24:18.750 --> 04:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
poverty by 2.3 percentage points that is
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
a large uh reduction in childhood
 
04:24:24.630 --> 04:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
poverty they found that the probability
 
04:24:27.990 --> 04:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
of children born in the poorest 20% of
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
households the probability that they'll
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
reach the top 20% increased in right to
 
04:24:34.750 --> 04:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
work states by 1.7 percentage
 
04:24:37.870 --> 04:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
points reduced long-term joblessness
 
04:24:42.670 --> 04:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:44.750 --> 04:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
reduced Social Security Disability
 
04:24:48.070 --> 04:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
Benefits recipients by 0.33 percentage
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
points what does this show what they
 
04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
talk about in the study is when you pass
 
04:24:54.790 --> 04:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
a right to work law it tends to attract
 
04:24:57.269 --> 04:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
and improve the long-term economic
 
04:24:59.670 --> 04:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
prospects of people who are the hardest
 
04:25:02.229 --> 04:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
to employ New Hampshire still has not
 
04:25:04.990 --> 04:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
recovered from prepandemic on our labor
 
04:25:07.830 --> 04:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
force participation rate right to work
 
04:25:10.790 --> 04:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
states improve labor force
 
04:25:13.710 --> 04:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
participation what they did not find is
 
04:25:16.149 --> 04:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
any reduction in wages or total
 
04:25:18.750 --> 04:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
compensation and they separated those
 
04:25:21.109 --> 04:25:21.119 align:start position:0%
out if New Hampshire passed a right to
 
04:25:22.990 --> 04:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
work law we think that it would
 
04:25:24.750 --> 04:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
significantly increase manufacturing
 
04:25:27.590 --> 04:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
employment increase overall employment
 
04:25:29.550 --> 04:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's time that's time
 
04:25:32.349 --> 04:25:32.359 align:start position:0%
all right I appreciate it representative
 
04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
grer thank thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:25:36.429 --> 04:25:36.439 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question do you happen
 
04:25:38.109 --> 04:25:38.119 align:start position:0%
to know off hand if it's if it's buried
 
04:25:39.910 --> 04:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
in the study somewhere I'm not going to
 
04:25:41.950 --> 04:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
like require you to like it up but you
 
04:25:43.710 --> 04:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
say 19% reduction in long-term
 
04:25:45.149 --> 04:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
unemployment among males do you happen
 
04:25:47.590 --> 04:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
to know what they consider longterm uh I
 
04:25:49.830 --> 04:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
can't off top my head answer that butk
 
04:25:52.229 --> 04:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
there there is a way that they measure
 
04:25:56.189 --> 04:25:56.199 align:start position:0%
that represent McKenzie thank you uh Mr
 
04:25:58.590 --> 04:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I haven't had a chance to
 
04:26:02.030 --> 04:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
read the study sure um but let me say
 
04:26:04.469 --> 04:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
this I'm somewhat familiar with the
 
04:26:06.189 --> 04:26:06.199 align:start position:0%
employment trends in New Hampshire and
 
04:26:06.199 --> 04:26:07.149 align:start position:0%
employment trends in New Hampshire and
the

04:26:07.149 --> 04:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:26:10.910 --> 04:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
statistics um that are published by the
 
04:26:13.550 --> 04:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Employment Security Y and
 
04:26:16.149 --> 04:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
the question I have in the context of
 
04:26:20.670 --> 04:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
this uh study has that uh have those
 
04:26:22.830 --> 04:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
numbers been taken into consideration
 
04:26:25.349 --> 04:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
can we drill down into that study to get
 
04:26:28.030 --> 04:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire specific impacts or is
 
04:26:30.349 --> 04:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
this a more Global study because some of
 
04:26:32.149 --> 04:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
the numbers that you come up with I
 
04:26:34.229 --> 04:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
would challenge in terms of the New
 
04:26:35.670 --> 04:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy well so these
 
04:26:37.030 --> 04:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
particular the Harvard study didn't look
 
04:26:38.030 --> 04:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire because we haven't
 
04:26:39.550 --> 04:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
passed a right to work law so this is a
 
04:26:41.189 --> 04:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
study of states that passed a right to
 
04:26:43.149 --> 04:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
work law that bordered a state that
 
04:26:45.389 --> 04:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
didn't pass a right to work law but um
 
04:26:46.710 --> 04:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
when I mentioned the labor force
 
04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
participation rate so New Hampshire has
 
04:26:50.389 --> 04:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
done better than I think every every
 
04:26:51.630 --> 04:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
state in New England if not every state
 
04:26:54.590 --> 04:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
in the country on getting back to work
 
04:26:57.030 --> 04:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
after the pandemic yet our labor force
 
04:26:59.149 --> 04:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
participation rate is still lower so
 
04:27:01.109 --> 04:27:01.119 align:start position:0%
we're in the low 60s we were um in the
 
04:27:03.710 --> 04:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
high 60s before so so we do have a
 
04:27:06.109 --> 04:27:06.119 align:start position:0%
percentage of the population that still
 
04:27:09.710 --> 04:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
has not come back to work and that's one
 
04:27:10.910 --> 04:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
of the things that they found that right
 
04:27:13.149 --> 04:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
to work can help with
 
04:27:16.070 --> 04:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay and representative laby thank you
 
04:27:18.109 --> 04:27:18.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh thank you Mr Klein for
 
04:27:20.149 --> 04:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh to indulge you
 
04:27:21.590 --> 04:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
what are the other types of businesses
 
04:27:22.750 --> 04:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
that we could expect that could
 
04:27:24.429 --> 04:27:24.439 align:start position:0%
potentially come to New Hampshire let
 
04:27:26.950 --> 04:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
you finish well so it it really depends
 
04:27:28.229 --> 04:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
and you don't want to make predictions
 
04:27:29.630 --> 04:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
of the future based on studies of the
 
04:27:31.590 --> 04:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
past in terms of you know getting down
 
04:27:34.630 --> 04:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
into the specifics but the Harvard study
 
04:27:37.109 --> 04:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
is just one of many that found a really
 
04:27:39.149 --> 04:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
significant increase in manufacturing
 
04:27:41.429 --> 04:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
employment after States became right to
 
04:27:43.070 --> 04:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
work state so I think think at the very
 
04:27:45.030 --> 04:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
least we have
 
04:27:48.630 --> 04:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
70,000 um roughly manufacturing jobs in
 
04:27:50.389 --> 04:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire right now if you look
 
04:27:52.670 --> 04:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
at the Harvard study which was a 28%
 
04:27:54.550 --> 04:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
increase in manufacturing jobs there's
 
04:27:56.269 --> 04:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
another study um that was done a couple
 
04:27:58.550 --> 04:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
years before um that found a 20%
 
04:27:59.950 --> 04:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
increase in manufacturing jobs so if you
 
04:28:02.950 --> 04:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
just take that range um you're talking
 
04:28:06.750 --> 04:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
14,000 to 20,000 is new manufacturing
 
04:28:09.189 --> 04:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
jobs in New Hampshire I mean that that's
 
04:28:12.750 --> 04:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
massive that is a big response and and
 
04:28:15.750 --> 04:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
there are conflicting findings on wages
 
04:28:17.269 --> 04:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
right so some studies like the Harvard
 
04:28:19.229 --> 04:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
one some others have not found that it
 
04:28:21.790 --> 04:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
reduces wages some have found um changes
 
04:28:25.389 --> 04:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
in wages but what studies seem to be
 
04:28:28.109 --> 04:28:28.119 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent on is increases in
 
04:28:30.590 --> 04:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
employment and increases in economic
 
04:28:32.030 --> 04:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
growth one of the things the Harvard
 
04:28:34.349 --> 04:28:34.359 align:start position:0%
research specifically looked at to try
 
04:28:36.109 --> 04:28:36.119 align:start position:0%
to tease out when looking at those
 
04:28:38.269 --> 04:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
border counties was the increase in
 
04:28:41.269 --> 04:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
employment just substituting employment
 
04:28:42.710 --> 04:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
that already exists in other words were
 
04:28:46.070 --> 04:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
the new jobs just taking jobs uh
 
04:28:47.389 --> 04:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
employees from other jobs in the
 
04:28:48.750 --> 04:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
community and they found that was not
 
04:28:50.990 --> 04:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
the case that they were net new jobs in
 
04:28:52.990 --> 04:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
fact they were attracting a lot of
 
04:28:56.030 --> 04:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
employment from the other state so for
 
04:28:57.910 --> 04:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you he a lot of people
 
04:28:59.710 --> 04:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
complaining about all these people in
 
04:29:01.510 --> 04:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we go to work in
 
04:29:03.349 --> 04:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts becoming right to work
 
04:29:06.710 --> 04:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
state would to some extent switch that
 
04:29:08.149 --> 04:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
commuter rate so you would have more
 
04:29:10.149 --> 04:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
commuters coming into uh New Hampshire
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts which helps the local
 
04:29:15.229 --> 04:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
economy so our review of the literature
 
04:29:16.950 --> 04:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
on this is that it would be an
 
04:29:19.229 --> 04:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
unequivocal economic win and when we're
 
04:29:20.389 --> 04:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
looking at State
 
04:29:20.399 --> 04:29:21.950 align:start position:0%
looking at State
revenues

04:29:21.950 --> 04:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
04:29:24.189 --> 04:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
um you're increasing these jobs you're
 
04:29:25.630 --> 04:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
increasing employment you're adding
 
04:29:28.710 --> 04:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
businesses you're increasing uh business
 
04:29:30.750 --> 04:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
activity which increases your business
 
04:29:32.349 --> 04:29:32.359 align:start position:0%
profits which increases your business
 
04:29:35.189 --> 04:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
profits taxes we think that if we pass
 
04:29:36.510 --> 04:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
the right to work law in New Hampshire
 
04:29:38.070 --> 04:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
Not only would our economy Thrive Not
 
04:29:39.710 --> 04:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
only would our blue collar worker sector
 
04:29:43.070 --> 04:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
Thrive but State revenues will go up as
 
04:29:46.149 --> 04:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
well representative K I'm sorry did you
 
04:29:47.030 --> 04:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:29:49.550 --> 04:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
followup okay got it representative K
 
04:29:51.670 --> 04:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr kle
 
04:29:54.670 --> 04:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
Sure uh did this study uh control for
 
04:29:57.309 --> 04:29:57.319 align:start position:0%
items such as demogra de demographics I
 
04:29:58.870 --> 04:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
know we have we're suffering from a gray
 
04:30:02.429 --> 04:30:02.439 align:start position:0%
tsunami myself included and and energy
 
04:30:06.030 --> 04:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
cost uh availability of uh quality
 
04:30:09.189 --> 04:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
education affordable uh housing anything
 
04:30:11.590 --> 04:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
like that were those factors considered
 
04:30:13.189 --> 04:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
well I can't list every single thing
 
04:30:15.469 --> 04:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
that they controlled for but they did
 
04:30:17.349 --> 04:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
control for other factors to try to
 
04:30:19.510 --> 04:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
isolate the effect of right to work law
 
04:30:20.790 --> 04:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
in particular and that's one of the
 
04:30:22.750 --> 04:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
things that some previous Studies have
 
04:30:25.550 --> 04:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
not done very well is try to isolate to
 
04:30:28.750 --> 04:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
see if the changes were caused by the
 
04:30:30.670 --> 04:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
right to work law and these Harvard
 
04:30:34.870 --> 04:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
researchers um concluded that they could
 
04:30:37.070 --> 04:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
pinpoint it to the right to workw work
 
04:30:40.429 --> 04:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
law itself um but if you're getting to
 
04:30:41.790 --> 04:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
the point that I think you asked another
 
04:30:41.800 --> 04:30:42.590 align:start position:0%
the point that I think you asked another
uh

04:30:42.590 --> 04:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:30:45.389 --> 04:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
person testifying before about business
 
04:30:48.429 --> 04:30:48.439 align:start position:0%
relocation look everybody knows that
 
04:30:49.710 --> 04:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
businesses relocate for all kinds of
 
04:30:51.469 --> 04:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
reasons right you do look for um good
 
04:30:53.109 --> 04:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
education you look good Workforce you
 
04:30:55.870 --> 04:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
look for low taxes you look for um you
 
04:30:59.229 --> 04:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
know all kinds of costs and inputs right
 
04:31:02.349 --> 04:31:02.359 align:start position:0%
right to work is a factor and business
 
04:31:04.910 --> 04:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
um surveys of Executives surveys of
 
04:31:06.429 --> 04:31:06.439 align:start position:0%
Corporations surveys of leadership but
 
04:31:09.670 --> 04:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
also studies that track employment all
 
04:31:12.229 --> 04:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
find that right to work state are
 
04:31:13.790 --> 04:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
associated with a pretty substantial
 
04:31:16.990 --> 04:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
increase in employment follow up yes sir
 
04:31:19.229 --> 04:31:19.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you again
 
04:31:21.389 --> 04:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
uh yesterday during our orientation from
 
04:31:24.149 --> 04:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
Employment Security we learned clearly
 
04:31:26.670 --> 04:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
confirmed that we have a we're a net net
 
04:31:29.550 --> 04:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
negative job loss to Massachusetts and I
 
04:31:31.189 --> 04:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
I wonder could you tell me if that's for
 
04:31:35.229 --> 04:31:35.239 align:start position:0%
wages or other employment protections or
 
04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
I know they're not a right to work state
 
04:31:40.830 --> 04:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
are they well we're not either um so are
 
04:31:43.550 --> 04:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
are you asking
 
04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
so Boston area right is a very large
 
04:31:48.710 --> 04:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
economy there are a lot of people who
 
04:31:51.229 --> 04:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
live in New Hampshire who work in
 
04:31:53.189 --> 04:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is that what you mean by
 
04:31:55.389 --> 04:31:55.399 align:start position:0%
net job loss is people commuting to mass
 
04:31:58.990 --> 04:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
for jobs yes right so one thing you have
 
04:32:02.389 --> 04:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
to ask yourself is why did those people
 
04:32:05.750 --> 04:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
move to New Hampshire because a large
 
04:32:07.990 --> 04:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
percentage of those people moved from
 
04:32:10.590 --> 04:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to New Hampshire to then
 
04:32:13.550 --> 04:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
continue commuting so they came here for
 
04:32:16.670 --> 04:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
low taxes um often they came for lots of
 
04:32:21.030 --> 04:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
other reasons but again a right what the
 
04:32:22.710 --> 04:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
Harvard researchers found was when one
 
04:32:24.590 --> 04:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
state flips to right to work and the
 
04:32:26.630 --> 04:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
other state does not you increase
 
04:32:28.389 --> 04:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
commuting from the non-ri to workstate
 
04:32:30.149 --> 04:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
into the right to workstate because the
 
04:32:31.870 --> 04:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
economy and the job growth in the right
 
04:32:31.880 --> 04:32:33.590 align:start position:0%
economy and the job growth in the right
to

04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:32:37.469 --> 04:32:37.479 align:start position:0%
workstate okay uh represent McKenzie and
 
04:32:40.550 --> 04:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
I'll come back okay so from a research
 
04:32:43.109 --> 04:32:43.119 align:start position:0%
perspective yeah
 
04:32:45.229 --> 04:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
the data that you're
 
04:32:48.990 --> 04:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
presenting is data that looks at right
 
04:32:50.630 --> 04:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
to work states and
 
04:32:54.550 --> 04:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
impacts but there is no specific uh data
 
04:32:57.109 --> 04:32:57.119 align:start position:0%
correct that would look at New Hampshire
 
04:32:59.750 --> 04:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
specifically because we could be very
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
different in a lot of ways from those
 
04:33:04.709 --> 04:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
States who have adopted it so would it
 
04:33:08.470 --> 04:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
be legitimate to ask of your group that
 
04:33:11.429 --> 04:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
they study New Hampshire uh as opposed
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
to imposing data from other other states
 
04:33:17.189 --> 04:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
throughout the country um I appreciate
 
04:33:19.349 --> 04:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
the question uh representative uh that
 
04:33:21.109 --> 04:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
that's not really how this kind of
 
04:33:24.590 --> 04:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
research works so to understand what the
 
04:33:26.830 --> 04:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
impacts are of a change in the law you
 
04:33:28.150 --> 04:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
look at the states where they actually
 
04:33:31.109 --> 04:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
change the law and when research have
 
04:33:33.390 --> 04:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
done that and the best studies on Right
 
04:33:35.349 --> 04:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
to Work do look at the borders there are
 
04:33:36.670 --> 04:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
other not just the Harvard study
 
04:33:38.310 --> 04:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
there've been others that look at border
 
04:33:41.830 --> 04:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
counties and it's pretty solid evidence
 
04:33:44.551 --> 04:33:44.561 align:start position:0%
when that happens you get a substantial
 
04:33:46.590 --> 04:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
increase in employment um manufacturing
 
04:33:49.109 --> 04:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
jobs overall jobs and these other um
 
04:33:51.750 --> 04:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
Fallon benefits in the right to work
 
04:33:54.830 --> 04:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
state and not in the state that didn't
 
04:33:58.230 --> 04:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
change okay and representative
 
04:34:01.789 --> 04:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
stop um thank you um I have not had an
 
04:34:04.670 --> 04:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to read the um the study
 
04:34:07.990 --> 04:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
that uh um you are referring to but I I
 
04:34:10.629 --> 04:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
did do some other research and would you
 
04:34:13.269 --> 04:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
believe that in two contiguous states
 
04:34:15.709 --> 04:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
Arkansas with right to work and Missouri
 
04:34:18.750 --> 04:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
that has rejected right to work the mean
 
04:34:27.869 --> 04:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:31.109 --> 04:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
49,74697 next door in Missouri where
 
04:34:33.349 --> 04:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
they've rejected right to work um the
 
04:34:39.109 --> 04:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:42.230 --> 04:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
$57,900 and then when you look at Mexico
 
04:34:44.830 --> 04:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
and Arizona Arizona which is a right to
 
04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
work state has uh $62,000 a year medium
 
04:34:52.590 --> 04:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
wage and New Mexico is at 53 where they
 
04:34:54.429 --> 04:34:54.439 align:start position:0%
don't have right to work so it seems
 
04:34:58.830 --> 04:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
like there are a lot of different um um
 
04:35:01.390 --> 04:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
things that that contribute to whether
 
04:35:03.789 --> 04:35:03.799 align:start position:0%
um right to work will improve things or
 
04:35:06.109 --> 04:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
not and I'm just curious about what you
 
04:35:09.750 --> 04:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
would uh make of that right so um one of
 
04:35:12.269 --> 04:35:12.279 align:start position:0%
the problems with the research that gets
 
04:35:15.830 --> 04:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
out on right to work laws is the
 
04:35:19.109 --> 04:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
rigor um so you can look at this was a
 
04:35:20.390 --> 04:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
problem with a lot of the early studies
 
04:35:21.670 --> 04:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
in right to work states because a lot of
 
04:35:23.029 --> 04:35:23.039 align:start position:0%
the earlier right to work states were in
 
04:35:26.150 --> 04:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
the South and so a lot of the non-right
 
04:35:28.109 --> 04:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
to work states were in the north and so
 
04:35:30.670 --> 04:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
people were not properly accounting for
 
04:35:33.429 --> 04:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
cost of living um so you would have
 
04:35:35.150 --> 04:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
these studies that say oh the the right
 
04:35:36.910 --> 04:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
to work wages are so low well if you
 
04:35:39.230 --> 04:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
don't count for right uh for cost of
 
04:35:41.269 --> 04:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
living you're going to find that it's
 
04:35:43.349 --> 04:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
apples on Ares so I'm not familiar with
 
04:35:45.510 --> 04:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
that particular research um but what I
 
04:35:48.590 --> 04:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
would say is you can look at snapshots
 
04:35:50.390 --> 04:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
of wages and that doesn't necessarily
 
04:35:52.390 --> 04:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
tell you a lot you want to try to
 
04:35:54.109 --> 04:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
pinpoint like the Harvard study and some
 
04:35:57.310 --> 04:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
other high quality Studies have done um
 
04:35:59.269 --> 04:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
what the Baseline was and what the
 
04:36:01.429 --> 04:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
change is once the right to work law
 
04:36:04.230 --> 04:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
took effect and in those cases they tend
 
04:36:07.189 --> 04:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
to find a massive increase in economic
 
04:36:11.070 --> 04:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
activity jobs Etc so we're looking at a
 
04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
lot of res Arch that shows that right to
 
04:36:14.709 --> 04:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
work really does improve a state's
 
04:36:16.070 --> 04:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
overall economy and improve the
 
04:36:18.590 --> 04:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
employment picture and I think that's
 
04:36:21.269 --> 04:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
pretty clear from the preponderance of
 
04:36:24.390 --> 04:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
the research okay representative kale
 
04:36:27.349 --> 04:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
you pass okay representative
 
04:36:29.429 --> 04:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:36:32.070 --> 04:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question sure um You
 
04:36:34.269 --> 04:36:34.279 align:start position:0%
referred to the rigor of the Harvard
 
04:36:38.109 --> 04:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
study um we've heard earlier and have
 
04:36:41.269 --> 04:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
been told that uh it the Harvard study
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
has not been published it has not been
 
04:36:45.029 --> 04:36:45.039 align:start position:0%
peer reviewed it's published on their
 
04:36:48.349 --> 04:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
website sir it's published where um so
 
04:36:49.990 --> 04:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I I didn't mean to interrupt
 
04:36:51.551 --> 04:36:51.561 align:start position:0%
you go ahead I'm I'm talking about
 
04:36:56.109 --> 04:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
publish in an academic uh manner um and
 
04:36:58.789 --> 04:36:58.799 align:start position:0%
um so there's there's questions about
 
04:37:01.070 --> 04:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
the rigor that uh is in place with the
 
04:37:04.150 --> 04:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
Harvard study can you respond I I I
 
04:37:05.750 --> 04:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
would respectfully disagree I don't
 
04:37:06.869 --> 04:37:06.879 align:start position:0%
believe there's any questions about the
 
04:37:06.879 --> 04:37:08.269 align:start position:0%
believe there's any questions about the
rigor

04:37:08.269 --> 04:37:08.279 align:start position:0%
rigor
 
04:37:10.629 --> 04:37:10.639 align:start position:0%
um academic studies are not always
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
published in in peer rreview journals
 
04:37:14.750 --> 04:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's just the nature of the way it
 
04:37:16.949 --> 04:37:16.959 align:start position:0%
works um Harvard publishes a lot of its
 
04:37:19.670 --> 04:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
own studies uh on its you through its
 
04:37:22.551 --> 04:37:22.561 align:start position:0%
own publishing um one of the authors
 
04:37:23.949 --> 04:37:23.959 align:start position:0%
works for and is published by the
 
04:37:25.470 --> 04:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
National Bureau of economic research
 
04:37:28.029 --> 04:37:28.039 align:start position:0%
which is a highly respected um economic
 
04:37:29.470 --> 04:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
outfit and those studies aren't peer
 
04:37:32.109 --> 04:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
reviewed either it's not um necessarily
 
04:37:33.869 --> 04:37:33.879 align:start position:0%
a ding on the study that it hasn't been
 
04:37:35.670 --> 04:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
published in a peer-review journal
 
04:37:35.680 --> 04:37:37.189 align:start position:0%
published in a peer-review journal
follow

04:37:37.189 --> 04:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
follow
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
up on on a different topic um You
 
04:37:43.109 --> 04:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
referred to the level of employment
 
04:37:46.830 --> 04:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
participation um being um relatively low
 
04:37:50.910 --> 04:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and um my understanding
 
04:37:54.830 --> 04:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
is that a large driver of that is uh the
 
04:37:57.029 --> 04:37:57.039 align:start position:0%
um inaccessibility and the high cost of
 
04:38:00.629 --> 04:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
child care would Right to Work have any
 
04:38:02.949 --> 04:38:02.959 align:start position:0%
impact on that
 
04:38:05.189 --> 04:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
problem that's an interesting question I
 
04:38:07.070 --> 04:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
don't know that it would have any impact
 
04:38:09.470 --> 04:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
on child care I mean I think one of the
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
things you've seen in New Hampshire with
 
04:38:15.709 --> 04:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
child care is uh regulations uh that
 
04:38:19.150 --> 04:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
dictate and um Staffing ratios and all
 
04:38:20.830 --> 04:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of other regulations on childcare
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
centers that make it sort of hard to
 
04:38:24.189 --> 04:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
start one and with child care what you
 
04:38:26.510 --> 04:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
saw um in the last several years just
 
04:38:28.070 --> 04:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
like with housing in New Hampshire is a
 
04:38:32.029 --> 04:38:32.039 align:start position:0%
massive surgeon demand but almost no in
 
04:38:34.830 --> 04:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
increase in Supply so for childcare you
 
04:38:36.709 --> 04:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
want to increase the supply I don't know
 
04:38:38.310 --> 04:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
that right to work is going to
 
04:38:39.390 --> 04:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily help with that I don't know
 
04:38:40.429 --> 04:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of child care
 
04:38:45.869 --> 04:38:45.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:47.269 --> 04:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
any further
 
04:38:47.279 --> 04:38:49.390 align:start position:0%
any further
questions

04:38:49.390 --> 04:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:38:52.949 --> 04:38:52.959 align:start position:0%
please so it's your position today that
 
04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
um that the study that you're talking
 
04:38:57.949 --> 04:38:57.959 align:start position:0%
about which is controversial in some
 
04:39:02.470 --> 04:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
some areas that that would absolutely
 
04:39:06.070 --> 04:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
apply looking at New Hampshire you you
 
04:39:08.990 --> 04:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
you could analyze the whole environment
 
04:39:11.070 --> 04:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire and you can save it
 
04:39:13.510 --> 04:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
conf now that that would be that that
 
04:39:14.949 --> 04:39:14.959 align:start position:0%
would be what would happen in New
 
04:39:16.789 --> 04:39:16.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no sir that's not how academic
 
04:39:19.230 --> 04:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
studies work um you look at what
 
04:39:21.150 --> 04:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
happened in other states and so one of
 
04:39:22.310 --> 04:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
the things about the Harvard study and
 
04:39:23.310 --> 04:39:23.320 align:start position:0%
there are others it's not just the
 
04:39:25.869 --> 04:39:25.879 align:start position:0%
Harvard one I that's a recent one and it
 
04:39:27.789 --> 04:39:27.799 align:start position:0%
was extremely thorough which is why it's
 
04:39:29.830 --> 04:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
cited so much
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
um you look at the effects when a law
 
04:39:36.029 --> 04:39:36.039 align:start position:0%
was introduced over the long term that's
 
04:39:37.390 --> 04:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
what the Harvard study tried to do is
 
04:39:40.150 --> 04:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
look at the long term and tease out the
 
04:39:42.510 --> 04:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
effects that they could is ol at and say
 
04:39:44.910 --> 04:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
and pinpoint with some clarity we're
 
04:39:46.670 --> 04:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
caused by that change in the right to
 
04:39:49.590 --> 04:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
work law um that doesn't guarantee that
 
04:39:51.230 --> 04:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
precisely the same thing will happen but
 
04:39:53.230 --> 04:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
what they did was they looked at right
 
04:39:54.590 --> 04:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
to work states around the country so
 
04:39:56.670 --> 04:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
they could try to get um a ballpark
 
04:39:58.190 --> 04:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
figure so it's not necessarily that you
 
04:40:00.590 --> 04:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
would have specifically for example a
 
04:40:03.030 --> 04:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
28% increase in your manufacturing
 
04:40:06.190 --> 04:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
Workforce but when you look at the range
 
04:40:08.150 --> 04:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's what they came up with was 28%
 
04:40:11.150 --> 04:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
across all states that had done this so
 
04:40:12.948 --> 04:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
it's it's a pretty solid bet when that's
 
04:40:14.910 --> 04:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
consistent with other studies that show
 
04:40:16.990 --> 04:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
a a large increase in the manufacturing
 
04:40:20.230 --> 04:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
work scores you come to the conclusion
 
04:40:22.310 --> 04:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
that you right to work studies are uh
 
04:40:24.190 --> 04:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
right to work laws are associated with a
 
04:40:25.750 --> 04:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial increase in
 
04:40:27.150 --> 04:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and all sorts of other
 
04:40:30.030 --> 04:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
things so um that's that's just how it
 
04:40:31.868 --> 04:40:31.878 align:start position:0%
works you would expect that to happen in
 
04:40:33.310 --> 04:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to some degree but you
 
04:40:35.110 --> 04:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
can't pinpoint the precise number and
 
04:40:37.430 --> 04:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
say well it'll be 28% thank you that's
 
04:40:39.910 --> 04:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
important no representative Granger
 
04:40:41.470 --> 04:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:40:42.670 --> 04:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
my question do you have a spare New
 
04:40:43.830 --> 04:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you could pass right to work
 
04:40:45.708 --> 04:40:45.718 align:start position:0%
on just so we could
 
04:40:48.310 --> 04:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
compare I wish that would be great you
 
04:40:49.910 --> 04:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
know and that's one of the reasons we
 
04:40:51.708 --> 04:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
just to pinpoint this study and the
 
04:40:53.270 --> 04:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
other studies that look County to County
 
04:40:55.868 --> 04:40:55.878 align:start position:0%
on those borders um that creates the
 
04:40:57.868 --> 04:40:57.878 align:start position:0%
control group right so that's why you do
 
04:40:59.430 --> 04:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
those border studies because you have a
 
04:41:01.230 --> 04:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
natural control group of the counties on
 
04:41:02.590 --> 04:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
one side that didn't go right to work
 
04:41:04.550 --> 04:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
and the counties on the other that did
 
04:41:06.230 --> 04:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
so that creates that control group so
 
04:41:07.310 --> 04:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
you can sort of say this was
 
04:41:08.830 --> 04:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
attributable to the right to work law as
 
04:41:10.708 --> 04:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
opposed to some other studies that
 
04:41:12.310 --> 04:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
aren't really quite so good that just
 
04:41:14.070 --> 04:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
will take snapshots and say well in this
 
04:41:15.550 --> 04:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
right to work state the wages are X in
 
04:41:17.110 --> 04:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
this non-ri to work state the wages are
 
04:41:19.070 --> 04:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
X so therefore you know they're not
 
04:41:20.670 --> 04:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
isolating that kind of thing it's not
 
04:41:24.910 --> 04:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
really rigorous thank you very much sure
 
04:41:26.830 --> 04:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
okay sir thank you so much no other
 
04:41:28.910 --> 04:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
questions appreciate your
 
04:41:32.868 --> 04:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
testimony so I just uh I wanted to give
 
04:41:34.910 --> 04:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh Robert
 
04:41:38.390 --> 04:41:38.400 align:start position:0%

conquer I'll keep my remarks brief I'm
 
04:43:04.708 --> 04:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
speaking out against this bill it is not
 
04:43:07.070 --> 04:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
what we stand for here in New
 
04:43:09.670 --> 04:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's already been
 
04:43:12.230 --> 04:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
discussed in this legisl previously
 
04:43:14.910 --> 04:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
numerous times this legislature voted
 
04:43:17.310 --> 04:43:17.320 align:start position:0%
this measure
 
04:43:22.470 --> 04:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
down it's had many names SP sp61 s
 
04:43:25.310 --> 04:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
sp16 HB
 
04:43:27.708 --> 04:43:27.718 align:start position:0%
238 this has been voted down there have
 
04:43:29.110 --> 04:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
been both parties in control of
 
04:43:30.750 --> 04:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
legislature when that has
 
04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
occurred this brings us to today's
 
04:43:37.070 --> 04:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
hearing if this legisl pardon me if this
 
04:43:39.270 --> 04:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
legislation was voted down
 
04:43:41.550 --> 04:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
previously it proves that the
 
04:43:43.030 --> 04:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
legislature no matter what side of the
 
04:43:44.190 --> 04:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
Alle you we're
 
04:43:47.470 --> 04:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
on understands the value of unions and
 
04:43:49.670 --> 04:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
the vital role that unions play in
 
04:43:51.590 --> 04:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
securing jobs for working
 
04:43:54.510 --> 04:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
people our elected leaders have
 
04:43:56.110 --> 04:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
repeatedly defeated this piece of
 
04:43:58.470 --> 04:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
legislation because they understand that
 
04:44:00.310 --> 04:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
the free market doesn't need any further
 
04:44:03.310 --> 04:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
government intrusion or regulatory
 
04:44:06.230 --> 04:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
burdens into the private business
 
04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
World New Hampshire's government should
 
04:44:10.830 --> 04:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
not meddle in how private businesses in
 
04:44:13.070 --> 04:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
the State work together for their Mutual
 
04:44:15.550 --> 04:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
benefit contracts between private
 
04:44:17.150 --> 04:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
employers and labor unions are
 
04:44:18.910 --> 04:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
businessto business
 
04:44:21.150 --> 04:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
agreements that this legislature should
 
04:44:22.750 --> 04:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
leave to the free
 
04:44:25.708 --> 04:44:25.718 align:start position:0%
market this legislation does nothing for
 
04:44:27.230 --> 04:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
the working people of New
 
04:44:29.948 --> 04:44:29.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it actually is detrimental it
 
04:44:32.670 --> 04:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
should be named Right to Work For Less
 
04:44:35.350 --> 04:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
the average wage in right to work states
 
04:44:38.670 --> 04:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
is an average of $87,000 less than the
 
04:44:40.310 --> 04:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
same wage in non-right to work states
 
04:44:42.390 --> 04:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire
 
04:44:43.788 --> 04:44:43.798 align:start position:0%
supporters of this bill claimed that
 
04:44:46.230 --> 04:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
unions force people to join their
 
04:44:49.310 --> 04:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
cause using words like coercion and
 
04:44:51.510 --> 04:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
intimidation in previous versions of
 
04:44:55.150 --> 04:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
this bill I can personally speak to this
 
04:44:57.708 --> 04:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
more than seven years ago I
 
04:45:00.750 --> 04:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
voluntarily again voluntarily walked
 
04:45:04.470 --> 04:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
into the ibw local 490 Union Hall office
 
04:45:05.948 --> 04:45:05.958 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
04:45:09.230 --> 04:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
work I was employed at the time in the
 
04:45:10.670 --> 04:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
North country of New Hampshire at the
 
04:45:11.990 --> 04:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
mount Wasington
 
04:45:14.350 --> 04:45:14.360 align:start position:0%
Hotel I was looking for
 
04:45:17.510 --> 04:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
change in no way did I feel pressured or
 
04:45:20.430 --> 04:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
coerced to join this organization in
 
04:45:22.390 --> 04:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
fact the gentleman I spoke to wanted to
 
04:45:25.150 --> 04:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
make sure I was serious about
 
04:45:28.948 --> 04:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
joining as I am in my mid to late 40s
 
04:45:32.868 --> 04:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
now I have no regrets recently two years
 
04:45:35.070 --> 04:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
ago I was nominated by one of my union

represent part of conquer so glad you're
 
04:45:58.070 --> 04:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
here my question is um similar to one
 
04:46:00.310 --> 04:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
that representative stab has asked a few
 
04:46:02.948 --> 04:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
times about how many folks are in the
 
04:46:06.830 --> 04:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
training program at this point and do
 
04:46:09.750 --> 04:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
how do they make money during that
 
04:46:11.430 --> 04:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
time um
 
04:46:13.070 --> 04:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
during I am a product of the
 
04:46:16.150 --> 04:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship um I was in a five-year
 
04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
program and I worked while I earned
 
04:46:22.948 --> 04:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
while I learned I had my classes on
 
04:46:22.958 --> 04:46:24.590 align:start position:0%
while I learned I had my classes on
Saturdays

04:46:24.590 --> 04:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
Saturdays
 
04:46:27.788 --> 04:46:27.798 align:start position:0%
and I worked Monday through Friday and
 
04:46:31.708 --> 04:46:31.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes there I would not go to class
 
04:46:33.430 --> 04:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
in order to work overtime when it was
 
04:46:36.510 --> 04:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
offered but that was very seld them
 
04:46:41.868 --> 04:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
during th those first five years um
 
04:46:44.510 --> 04:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
I the the gentleman who spoke previously
 
04:46:46.310 --> 04:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
John Webb was our Apprentice director he
 
04:46:48.910 --> 04:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
would have the the the numbers in terms
 
04:46:51.190 --> 04:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
of our apprenticeship but I know that my
 
04:46:54.670 --> 04:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
class started with 26 and when graduated
 
04:46:58.030 --> 04:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
14 so there is there is some Fallout
 
04:47:00.430 --> 04:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
along the way it's I will say this is
 
04:47:02.948 --> 04:47:02.958 align:start position:0%
not for everybody what
 
04:47:05.590 --> 04:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
I've um told apprentices who I've worked
 
04:47:08.708 --> 04:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
with upand coming in the trade is this
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
isn't a job it's a it's a career
 
04:47:15.110 --> 04:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
and to stick with it if you feel because
 
04:47:17.868 --> 04:47:17.878 align:start position:0%
I have retirement secured for my
 
04:47:20.390 --> 04:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
family a 10-year-old
 
04:47:22.590 --> 04:47:22.600 align:start position:0%
who wants me to come and talk to his
 
04:47:23.910 --> 04:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
class all the
 
04:47:26.310 --> 04:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
time and maybe he'll be an electrician
 
04:47:28.190 --> 04:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
maybe he'll go to college I went St
 
04:47:31.510 --> 04:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
anome College oh sorry I do have one
 
04:47:33.868 --> 04:47:33.878 align:start position:0%
regret that I did not join the union
 
04:47:36.548 --> 04:47:36.558 align:start position:0%
when I graduated in
 
04:47:40.830 --> 04:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
2001 that's my only regret I but I enjoy
 
04:47:43.110 --> 04:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
enjoy what I do master electrician in
 
04:47:45.430 --> 04:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and
 
04:47:48.230 --> 04:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
Maine um it's provided incredible
 
04:47:50.470 --> 04:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities and I have spoken with Mr
 
04:47:51.948 --> 04:47:51.958 align:start position:0%
Webb about teaching in the
 
04:47:53.150 --> 04:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship because I do have a
 
04:47:54.548 --> 04:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
background in
 
04:47:58.548 --> 04:47:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:00.788 --> 04:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you for taking
 
04:48:03.110 --> 04:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
my question you said you worked in a in
 
04:48:06.750 --> 04:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
an at a at the Mount Washington I used
 
04:48:09.070 --> 04:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
to I was a front desk agent I worked
 
04:48:11.150 --> 04:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
overnight shift so I was a zombie all
 
04:48:13.110 --> 04:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
right so so you left that you walked
 
04:48:16.830 --> 04:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
into the union hall looking for work
 
04:48:20.708 --> 04:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
were you once they gave you the uh the
 
04:48:23.510 --> 04:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
specifics of joining were you infuriated
 
04:48:25.548 --> 04:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
when they told you you had to pay the
 
04:48:28.990 --> 04:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
fees NOP I can speak to the dues
 
04:48:31.868 --> 04:48:31.878 align:start position:0%
actually if you'd like yeah um what I
 
04:48:34.150 --> 04:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
tell a a lot of people who ask me the
 
04:48:36.390 --> 04:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
question about the dues my monthly dues
 
04:48:38.708 --> 04:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
are are equivalent to what I used to pay
 
04:48:41.510 --> 04:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
for my health insurance and benefits
 
04:48:46.190 --> 04:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
weekly at Mount Washington hotel is
 
04:48:49.470 --> 04:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
within $5 of that value and I paay that
 
04:48:52.350 --> 04:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
once a month I no longer pay out of
 
04:48:53.670 --> 04:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
pocket for
 
04:48:56.030 --> 04:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
insurance our contractors cover that
 
04:48:59.030 --> 04:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
cost as part of the work
 
04:49:01.990 --> 04:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
package that's the selling point for me
 
04:49:05.990 --> 04:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
I used I used to pay $40 $50 a
 
04:49:08.510 --> 04:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
week and that and my wife worked at
 
04:49:11.708 --> 04:49:11.718 align:start position:0%
Mount Washington as well she had her own
 
04:49:14.310 --> 04:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
insurance and when our son was born he
 
04:49:16.590 --> 04:49:16.600 align:start position:0%
was on Medicaid so he had his own
 
04:49:18.830 --> 04:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
insurance we didn't have a family plan
 
04:49:22.070 --> 04:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:25.150 --> 04:49:25.160 align:start position:0%
plan it as as someone spoke to earlier
 
04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
in the North Country it is a very
 
04:49:27.240 --> 04:49:28.350 align:start position:0%
in the North Country it is a very
depressed

04:49:28.350 --> 04:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
depressed
 
04:49:30.830 --> 04:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
economy and I
 
04:49:33.190 --> 04:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
drove 45 minutes to an hour to go to
 
04:49:37.310 --> 04:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
work from greton down to Breton
 
04:49:40.868 --> 04:49:40.878 align:start position:0%
Woods okay thank you did you have a
 
04:49:40.878 --> 04:49:43.628 align:start position:0%
Woods okay thank you did you have a
followup

04:49:43.628 --> 04:49:43.638 align:start position:0%
followup
 
04:49:45.948 --> 04:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
represent representative D Sylvester did
 
04:49:48.910 --> 04:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
you have a followup okay represent
 
04:49:51.430 --> 04:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
McKenzie thank you uh the purpose of
 
04:49:52.910 --> 04:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
this question is to flush out the
 
04:49:54.510 --> 04:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
difference between a clothes shop and a
 
04:49:54.520 --> 04:49:55.628 align:start position:0%
difference between a clothes shop and a
union

04:49:55.628 --> 04:49:55.638 align:start position:0%
union
 
04:49:59.030 --> 04:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
shop um when you applied when you walked
 
04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
through that door uh uh ibw yes uh did
 
04:50:06.270 --> 04:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
they say you couldn't come in here and
 
04:50:08.470 --> 04:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
get a job unless you were a union member
 
04:50:10.708 --> 04:50:10.718 align:start position:0%
no so that was the closed shop issue
 
04:50:12.750 --> 04:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
which is illegal so once you were in
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
there did they demand that you be part
 
04:50:16.310 --> 04:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:50:19.230 --> 04:50:19.240 align:start position:0%
Union no I had the choice whether to
 
04:50:21.190 --> 04:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
leave during my
 
04:50:23.350 --> 04:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship but the question is that
 
04:50:25.470 --> 04:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
this legislation is f if I'm sorry I
 
04:50:27.948 --> 04:50:27.958 align:start position:0%
don't mean to to to ask questions
 
04:50:27.958 --> 04:50:28.948 align:start position:0%
don't mean to to to ask questions
without

04:50:28.948 --> 04:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:50:32.590 --> 04:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
permission question proceed okay thank
 
04:50:36.430 --> 04:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
you um thanks for correcting yourself
 
04:50:39.430 --> 04:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
yeah it's an Italian thing you just keep
 
04:50:41.470 --> 04:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
talking uh
 
04:50:46.670 --> 04:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
so uh the the question I have is you
 
04:50:49.070 --> 04:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
voluntarily continue to pay the union
 
04:50:50.708 --> 04:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
once you join the union you continue to
 
04:50:54.470 --> 04:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
pay the dues correct but under the
 
04:50:58.190 --> 04:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
provision I'm sorry followup okay maybe
 
04:51:00.150 --> 04:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
if we just take it as questions rather
 
04:51:02.190 --> 04:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
than statements and then start from
 
04:51:02.200 --> 04:51:03.868 align:start position:0%
than statements and then start from
there

04:51:03.868 --> 04:51:03.878 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:51:03.878 --> 04:51:06.390 align:start position:0%
there
proceed

04:51:06.390 --> 04:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
04:51:08.708 --> 04:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
so I I think it'd be too difficult to
 
04:51:10.270 --> 04:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
flush this out I'm going to I'm going to
 
04:51:12.350 --> 04:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
pass thank you thank you sir appreciate
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:18.548 --> 04:51:18.558 align:start position:0%
else sir thank you I appreciate your
 
04:51:20.628 --> 04:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
testimony thank and I do have a copy of
 
04:51:23.750 --> 04:51:23.760 align:start position:0%

04:51:28.350 --> 04:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
out to everyone perfect thank you thank
 
04:51:45.670 --> 04:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:47.510 --> 04:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and honorable
 
04:51:49.310 --> 04:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is Alan rap I
 
04:51:51.548 --> 04:51:51.558 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire AFL CIO and
 
04:51:52.948 --> 04:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
I'm a resident of Manchester New
 
04:51:55.868 --> 04:51:55.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire really brief um I'm here in
 
04:51:59.628 --> 04:51:59.638 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB t238 FN this year's
 
04:52:01.510 --> 04:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
version of right to work um you've heard
 
04:52:02.990 --> 04:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
everything that I would have said I did
 
04:52:04.750 --> 04:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
want to hop on at the end real quickly
 
04:52:06.670 --> 04:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
just to state that you've heard a lot
 
04:52:09.110 --> 04:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
about this Harvard study um it's not a
 
04:52:11.830 --> 04:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
Harvard study a Harvard didn't decide to
 
04:52:13.548 --> 04:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
do this study and run the numbers on
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
this it's two people who were Harvard
 
04:52:18.628 --> 04:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
economists who had uh published the
 
04:52:21.030 --> 04:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
study through Harvard and when it's
 
04:52:22.750 --> 04:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
important to note that the fact that
 
04:52:24.190 --> 04:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
this hasn't been peer-reviewed the
 
04:52:26.270 --> 04:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
reason things are peer reviewed so peer-
 
04:52:28.670 --> 04:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
review just as a definition here for you
 
04:52:30.310 --> 04:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
it involves submitting research to other
 
04:52:31.990 --> 04:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
experts in the field who critically
 
04:52:34.868 --> 04:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
evaluate the methodology data analysis
 
04:52:37.548 --> 04:52:37.558 align:start position:0%
and its conclusions this study did none
 
04:52:39.990 --> 04:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
of that um so it would essentially be
 
04:52:41.750 --> 04:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
like if I had gone to Harvard and I was
 
04:52:43.628 --> 04:52:43.638 align:start position:0%
an economist and I wrote a paper that I
 
04:52:45.110 --> 04:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
thought was interesting about beliefs
 
04:52:47.230 --> 04:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
that I had Harvard published it through
 
04:52:49.110 --> 04:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
their website because I'm Harvard
 
04:52:51.310 --> 04:52:51.320 align:start position:0%
Economist and didn't have anybody else
 
04:52:53.628 --> 04:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
to look at it could say outlandish stuff
 
04:52:55.230 --> 04:52:55.240 align:start position:0%
and have no bearing in reality
 
04:52:57.868 --> 04:52:57.878 align:start position:0%
whatsoever but um I guess we can call
 
04:52:59.788 --> 04:52:59.798 align:start position:0%
that a study but I think most of the
 
04:53:01.150 --> 04:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
things that you're familiar with when
 
04:53:03.788 --> 04:53:03.798 align:start position:0%
people refer to a study and cite a study
 
04:53:06.070 --> 04:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
or data analysis stemming from a study
 
04:53:07.750 --> 04:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
is something that has been peer reviewed
 
04:53:09.548 --> 04:53:09.558 align:start position:0%
and is in some kind of academic journal
 
04:53:11.070 --> 04:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
or something like that so
 
04:53:13.110 --> 04:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
um yes studies do exist that are not
 
04:53:14.990 --> 04:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
peer reviewed but I think typically what
 
04:53:17.310 --> 04:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
you are all used to in this forum and
 
04:53:19.868 --> 04:53:19.878 align:start position:0%
hearing about data and studies is coming
 
04:53:21.670 --> 04:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
from a peer reviewed Journal something
 
04:53:23.310 --> 04:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
where other people in the field have
 
04:53:25.150 --> 04:53:25.160 align:start position:0%
looked at it and decided you know what
 
04:53:26.670 --> 04:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
this has validity this doesn't have
 
04:53:29.868 --> 04:53:29.878 align:start position:0%
validity um that's all I have to say and
 
04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much I appreciate your
 
04:53:35.590 --> 04:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:37.830 --> 04:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you sir I
 
04:53:42.030 --> 04:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:44.868 --> 04:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
okay last chance Last
 
04:53:55.708 --> 04:53:55.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:04.990 --> 04:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much Mr chair
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and the public
 
04:54:09.948 --> 04:54:09.958 align:start position:0%
members that are still patiently here at
 
04:54:12.150 --> 04:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
the end of a long and passionate hearing
 
04:54:14.110 --> 04:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Daniel popovic Miller
 
04:54:15.868 --> 04:54:15.878 align:start position:0%
representing Windham and the prime
 
04:54:19.270 --> 04:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill hb2 38 is needed to
 
04:54:21.070 --> 04:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
protect the rights of every worker to
 
04:54:22.750 --> 04:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
decide for themselves if they want to
 
04:54:25.628 --> 04:54:25.638 align:start position:0%
join a union or not nobody's trying to
 
04:54:28.110 --> 04:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
stop any worker from joining a union
 
04:54:30.110 --> 04:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
they want to join and testimony from the
 
04:54:32.190 --> 04:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
union members clearly show that there
 
04:54:34.510 --> 04:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
are very many happy union members and
 
04:54:36.830 --> 04:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
that unions provide valuable services to
 
04:54:39.230 --> 04:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
the people who choose to join them
 
04:54:40.548 --> 04:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
problem is that nobody should should
 
04:54:42.470 --> 04:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
force a worker to effectively join a
 
04:54:44.948 --> 04:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
union whose Services they do not want
 
04:54:47.150 --> 04:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
and that's all that this bill does
 
04:54:50.390 --> 04:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
nothing less nothing more yes nobody's
 
04:54:52.510 --> 04:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
legally forced to join the union anymore
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
but they are forced to pay the union for
 
04:54:57.510 --> 04:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
services they didn't ask for while Taft
 
04:55:00.110 --> 04:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
Hardley did close shops in 1947 they
 
04:55:01.948 --> 04:55:01.958 align:start position:0%
left it to the individual states to pass
 
04:55:04.510 --> 04:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
the legislation needed to finish the job
 
04:55:07.628 --> 04:55:07.638 align:start position:0%
without HB 238 there is no practical
 
04:55:09.230 --> 04:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
difference in New Hampshire between
 
04:55:11.350 --> 04:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
being a union member or not if a
 
04:55:13.868 --> 04:55:13.878 align:start position:0%
non-member is forced to pay the union
 
04:55:15.510 --> 04:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is needed to preserve the
 
04:55:18.350 --> 04:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
workers freedom of choice because saying
 
04:55:20.070 --> 04:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
if you don't like the union you can find
 
04:55:22.470 --> 04:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
another job is pretty much going back to
 
04:55:24.548 --> 04:55:24.558 align:start position:0%
close sh policies that are very much
 
04:55:26.990 --> 04:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
illegal so that's not really an argument
 
04:55:28.270 --> 04:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
I would
 
04:55:30.390 --> 04:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
consider if this was an attempt to
 
04:55:32.750 --> 04:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
weaken unions we would already have seen
 
04:55:35.150 --> 04:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
public sector unions slowly wither away
 
04:55:38.628 --> 04:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
since the 2018 janas Supreme Court case
 
04:55:40.270 --> 04:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
that provided public sector is a
 
04:55:42.788 --> 04:55:42.798 align:start position:0%
employees the same protections this bill
 
04:55:45.628 --> 04:55:45.638 align:start position:0%
would provide private sector workers has
 
04:55:47.628 --> 04:55:47.638 align:start position:0%
anyone seen the American federations of
 
04:55:50.510 --> 04:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
teachers or firefighters Union or police
 
04:55:52.270 --> 04:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
unions gets
 
04:55:54.750 --> 04:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
weaker they are as powerful and active
 
04:55:56.990 --> 04:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
as ever just as private sector unions
 
04:56:00.430 --> 04:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
will continue to be after H b238 becomes
 
04:56:03.270 --> 04:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
LW the National Labor relation Act of
 
04:56:06.390 --> 04:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
1935 does allow for members only unions
 
04:56:08.390 --> 04:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
and they exist and thrive in states that
 
04:56:11.070 --> 04:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
ended Forest unionism unions are only
 
04:56:12.948 --> 04:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
forced to provide representation to
 
04:56:15.628 --> 04:56:15.638 align:start position:0%
non-member workers because the union
 
04:56:17.510 --> 04:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
receives exclusive recognition that
 
04:56:20.070 --> 04:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
greatly benefits the Union by eliminated
 
04:56:22.030 --> 04:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
competition from other unions and by
 
04:56:24.948 --> 04:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
forcing every covered worker to pay them
 
04:56:26.830 --> 04:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
that rule exists to prevent non-union
 
04:56:28.868 --> 04:56:28.878 align:start position:0%
members from being treated unfairly
 
04:56:31.150 --> 04:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
during contract negotiations they no
 
04:56:33.990 --> 04:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
longer have a right to participate
 
04:56:36.830 --> 04:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
in the remedy to this concern is not to
 
04:56:39.430 --> 04:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
make it even worse by forcing workers to
 
04:56:41.708 --> 04:56:41.718 align:start position:0%
pay the unions it is to fix the federal
 
04:56:43.510 --> 04:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
laws that created this problem in the
 
04:56:45.830 --> 04:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
first place or for the unions to choose
 
04:56:48.750 --> 04:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
to represent their members only people
 
04:56:50.788 --> 04:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
have testified that this bill is a way
 
04:56:53.788 --> 04:56:53.798 align:start position:0%
to take away negotiating power actually
 
04:56:56.230 --> 04:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
this bill will specifically give more
 
04:56:59.110 --> 04:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
negotiation power to workers union
 
04:57:00.910 --> 04:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
members testifying today all spoke
 
04:57:03.430 --> 04:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
glowingly in favor of the Union if you
 
04:57:05.470 --> 04:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
talk to union members privately plenty
 
04:57:07.350 --> 04:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
of them will Express dissatisfaction
 
04:57:09.750 --> 04:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
with their actual ability to have a say
 
04:57:11.948 --> 04:57:11.958 align:start position:0%
in how the union has run and no voting
 
04:57:14.670 --> 04:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
for leadership once every 3 years is not
 
04:57:16.190 --> 04:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
having a lot of
 
04:57:18.628 --> 04:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
influence unions will have the same
 
04:57:21.510 --> 04:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
negotiating power as before versus the
 
04:57:24.350 --> 04:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
employer but they will have to pay more
 
04:57:26.788 --> 04:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
attention to individual workers to avoid
 
04:57:29.190 --> 04:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
making them unhappy enough so that they
 
04:57:32.230 --> 04:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
elect to stop paying union dues I
 
04:57:33.430 --> 04:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
strongly believe this will make the
 
04:57:35.390 --> 04:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
unions better they will have to be more
 
04:57:37.390 --> 04:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
willing to listen to and truly represent
 
04:57:39.548 --> 04:57:39.558 align:start position:0%
all their members instead of just
 
04:57:42.270 --> 04:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
listening to the 50% plus one they need
 
04:57:44.830 --> 04:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
to win an election every 3 years and
 
04:57:48.150 --> 04:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
staying stay in control people testify
 
04:57:50.030 --> 04:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
that if this bill passes the only people
 
04:57:52.070 --> 04:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
retiring with a pot of gold will be the
 
04:57:54.628 --> 04:57:54.638 align:start position:0%
company owners tell that to the many
 
04:57:56.670 --> 04:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
Seattle Microsoft stock options
 
04:57:58.990 --> 04:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
non-union millionaires to the many
 
04:58:01.510 --> 04:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
Boston biotech employees that went
 
04:58:04.390 --> 04:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
through a successful IPO to make
 
04:58:06.788 --> 04:58:06.798 align:start position:0%
millions as a naturalized citizen we
 
04:58:08.830 --> 04:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
chose to immigrate to the US because
 
04:58:10.110 --> 04:58:10.120 align:start position:0%
this is the best country in the world
 
04:58:12.470 --> 04:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
world for people to succeed based on on
 
04:58:14.910 --> 04:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
their own hard work and Merit and this
 
04:58:16.868 --> 04:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
bill will move us further ahead thank
 
04:58:18.430 --> 04:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
you for giving me the opportunity to
 
04:58:20.350 --> 04:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
testify in favor of this bill I would be
 
04:58:22.510 --> 04:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
04:58:24.070 --> 04:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
04:58:26.070 --> 04:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
grer thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:58:27.590 --> 04:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question people have
 
04:58:29.110 --> 04:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
claimed that right to work is a race to
 
04:58:30.350 --> 04:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
the bottom do you have anything to say
 
04:58:32.910 --> 04:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:35.310 --> 04:58:35.320 align:start position:0%
subject a good part of it was already
 
04:58:37.390 --> 04:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
covered by previous testimony from Drew
 
04:58:40.548 --> 04:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
Klein but let's just basically
 
04:58:43.708 --> 04:58:43.718 align:start position:0%
remind everybody what that argument is
 
04:58:46.510 --> 04:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
they compare wages in certain states to
 
04:58:49.230 --> 04:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
wages in other states and they claim
 
04:58:51.350 --> 04:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
that the causal relationship for the
 
04:58:54.150 --> 04:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
lower wages is are the right to work
 
04:58:57.390 --> 04:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
laws the correct way to compare wages is
 
04:59:00.070 --> 04:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
to adjust for cost of living you have to
 
04:59:02.270 --> 04:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
get paid more to work in New York City
 
04:59:04.270 --> 04:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
than you have to be paid to work in cost
 
04:59:06.548 --> 04:59:06.558 align:start position:0%
County the costs of living are totally
 
04:59:09.070 --> 04:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
different any study that does not adjust
 
04:59:11.470 --> 04:59:11.480 align:start position:0%
for that is a study whose methodology is
 
04:59:14.628 --> 04:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
U let's say poorly designed there is a
 
04:59:16.430 --> 04:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
huge amount of data showing that states
 
04:59:18.830 --> 04:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
that enforced unionism see faster job
 
04:59:21.230 --> 04:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
and wage growth the states that don't go
 
04:59:23.110 --> 04:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
back to the testimony we heard earlier
 
04:59:25.190 --> 04:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
from a union member related to job loss
 
04:59:27.990 --> 04:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
in the Mills they specifically said that
 
04:59:30.628 --> 04:59:30.638 align:start position:0%
the jobs went from New Hampshire to
 
04:59:32.628 --> 04:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
states that ended forc
 
04:59:36.750 --> 04:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
unionism this is a clear argument that
 
04:59:38.990 --> 04:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
passing this bill will have a positive
 
04:59:41.230 --> 04:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
impact because we will now be the place
 
04:59:43.868 --> 04:59:43.878 align:start position:0%
where other states companies want to
 
04:59:45.948 --> 04:59:45.958 align:start position:0%
move to we would be the only state
 
04:59:47.830 --> 04:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
attended Forest unionism north of
 
04:59:50.150 --> 04:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
Virginia greatly expanding our New
 
04:59:52.510 --> 04:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Advantage more jobs more
 
04:59:54.230 --> 04:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
competition for hiring New Hampshire
 
04:59:56.590 --> 04:59:56.600 align:start position:0%
workers that should lead to hire wages
 
04:59:58.390 --> 04:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
and unions that have to be more
 
05:00:00.750 --> 05:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
responsive to the people they represent
 
05:00:05.270 --> 05:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:07.990 --> 05:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
outcome any other questions
 
05:00:10.548 --> 05:00:10.558 align:start position:0%
representative stop thank you
 
05:00:12.788 --> 05:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
um during testimony today we heard that
 
05:00:15.150 --> 05:00:15.160 align:start position:0%
the inability to collect dues or agency
 
05:00:16.948 --> 05:00:16.958 align:start position:0%
fees would undermine the training
 
05:00:19.628 --> 05:00:19.638 align:start position:0%
programs that we need for um U much
 
05:00:22.350 --> 05:00:22.360 align:start position:0%
needed trades people in the state um
 
05:00:24.470 --> 05:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
what would you replace that
 
05:00:26.990 --> 05:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
with I don't think you'd need to replace
 
05:00:29.670 --> 05:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
it because when this type of legislation
 
05:00:32.270 --> 05:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
passes there is data showing that unions
 
05:00:34.270 --> 05:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
change their practices to be more
 
05:00:35.990 --> 05:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
accommodating to their members to
 
05:00:39.030 --> 05:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
prevent them essentially stopping you
 
05:00:41.990 --> 05:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
know to pay for their services so I
 
05:00:44.110 --> 05:00:44.120 align:start position:0%
believe that since unions will adjust by
 
05:00:46.110 --> 05:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
becoming better this will greatly
 
05:00:49.628 --> 05:00:49.638 align:start position:0%
decrease any estimated losses of income
 
05:00:51.948 --> 05:00:51.958 align:start position:0%
from those fees and therefore I don't
 
05:00:53.628 --> 05:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
expect a significant impact on the
 
05:00:56.150 --> 05:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
training programs which by the way
 
05:00:58.628 --> 05:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
they're a great example of what a good a
 
05:01:01.470 --> 05:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
well-run union should be doing I really
 
05:01:03.430 --> 05:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate hearing all those stories
 
05:01:05.708 --> 05:01:05.718 align:start position:0%
from people who are whose lives got
 
05:01:08.110 --> 05:01:08.120 align:start position:0%
changed for better for the union did you
 
05:01:10.070 --> 05:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
notice that all of them chose to be
 
05:01:10.080 --> 05:01:11.310 align:start position:0%
notice that all of them chose to be
union

05:01:11.310 --> 05:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
union
 
05:01:14.230 --> 05:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
members this all I'm trying to do I'm
 
05:01:16.150 --> 05:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that unions only
 
05:01:19.948 --> 05:01:19.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:22.230 --> 05:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
beong representative
 
05:01:24.310 --> 05:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
farington thank you today we heard a lot
 
05:01:26.548 --> 05:01:26.558 align:start position:0%
about passing this legislation and how
 
05:01:29.430 --> 05:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
it' be an infringement on two parties in
 
05:01:31.310 --> 05:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
the private sector what are your
 
05:01:34.190 --> 05:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that
 
05:01:37.590 --> 05:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
well one of the advantages of having
 
05:01:40.110 --> 05:01:40.120 align:start position:0%
this debate happen every year or two is
 
05:01:42.030 --> 05:01:42.040 align:start position:0%
that U there are not a lot of new
 
05:01:45.070 --> 05:01:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:48.548 --> 05:01:48.558 align:start position:0%
they there is zero impact on the right
 
05:01:50.510 --> 05:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
of business to negotiate with a union
 
05:01:52.670 --> 05:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
the bill if anything already reduces
 
05:01:55.190 --> 05:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
already existing interference I was born
 
05:01:57.070 --> 05:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
and raised in a communist country I take
 
05:01:59.390 --> 05:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
freedom very seriously and would never
 
05:02:02.270 --> 05:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor this bill if it actually reduced
 
05:02:04.590 --> 05:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
Freedom if you want to talk about the
 
05:02:07.030 --> 05:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
right of businesses and unions to
 
05:02:09.590 --> 05:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
negotiate there is nothing that prevents
 
05:02:11.628 --> 05:02:11.638 align:start position:0%
them from negotiating with each other
 
05:02:14.788 --> 05:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
and reaching whatever deal they want if
 
05:02:17.230 --> 05:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
businesses want to pay unions monthly
 
05:02:18.750 --> 05:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
fees for every
 
05:02:21.350 --> 05:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
employee they are more than free to sell
 
05:02:23.830 --> 05:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
from their own pocket if they feel that
 
05:02:26.350 --> 05:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
the union is that valuable what this
 
05:02:29.110 --> 05:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
bill will do is prevent the employer
 
05:02:31.310 --> 05:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
from reaching a deal with a union that
 
05:02:33.110 --> 05:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
allows the employer to reach into the
 
05:02:34.830 --> 05:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
pockets of employees that did not
 
05:02:37.110 --> 05:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
consent to this bill and take money to
 
05:02:39.948 --> 05:02:39.958 align:start position:0%
give to the union
 
05:02:40.948 --> 05:02:40.958 align:start position:0%
the only
 
05:02:44.110 --> 05:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
interference in private negotiations is
 
05:02:48.510 --> 05:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
from the 1935 nlra act which remove the
 
05:02:50.430 --> 05:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
right of non-union members to negotiate
 
05:02:52.830 --> 05:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
for their own wages and benefits this
 
05:02:54.868 --> 05:02:54.878 align:start position:0%
bill reduces that interference but
 
05:02:56.310 --> 05:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
cannot fully eliminated with the
 
05:02:59.070 --> 05:02:59.080 align:start position:0%
supremacy clause so no this is not an
 
05:03:01.470 --> 05:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
infringement on any right to contract
 
05:03:06.150 --> 05:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:10.150 --> 05:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
that the clerk thank you Mr chair so
 
05:03:15.350 --> 05:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative um if this bill fails how
 
05:03:17.910 --> 05:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
will it affect you and your future of
 
05:03:20.190 --> 05:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
your family and your
 
05:03:23.788 --> 05:03:23.798 align:start position:0%
future my concern is not for me I don't
 
05:03:26.310 --> 05:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
pass bills for me and my family I
 
05:03:29.030 --> 05:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
represent my town I represent my state
 
05:03:31.350 --> 05:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
and I believe that if this bill fails to
 
05:03:33.948 --> 05:03:33.958 align:start position:0%
pass it will be a negative impact on the
 
05:03:35.948 --> 05:03:35.958 align:start position:0%
state overall or at least it will be the
 
05:03:38.910 --> 05:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
lack of a potential positive impact I
 
05:03:40.548 --> 05:03:40.558 align:start position:0%
think that it's an opportunity to make
 
05:03:43.430 --> 05:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
our state better and if we fail to pass
 
05:03:46.590 --> 05:03:46.600 align:start position:0%
it we will continue to exist and do well
 
05:03:49.590 --> 05:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
but we could do better if we pass it
 
05:03:53.590 --> 05:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
follow up please please so do you know
 
05:03:56.830 --> 05:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
how it will negatively affect tens of
 
05:03:59.548 --> 05:03:59.558 align:start position:0%
thousands of our constituents our union
 
05:04:00.868 --> 05:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
members in New Hampshire not just in
 
05:04:04.750 --> 05:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
this room in the house throughout the
 
05:04:06.590 --> 05:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the whole state including
 
05:04:09.948 --> 05:04:09.958 align:start position:0%
myself it could be a big detriment on my
 
05:04:11.750 --> 05:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
future and the future of all the people
 
05:04:14.270 --> 05:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
that this will affect would it be
 
05:04:16.628 --> 05:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
possible to ask for a clarification as
 
05:04:18.070 --> 05:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
what the detriment is that you are
 
05:04:18.080 --> 05:04:19.430 align:start position:0%
what the detriment is that you are
referring

05:04:19.430 --> 05:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
referring
 
05:04:22.390 --> 05:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
to specifically I'm just not sure how to
 
05:04:26.548 --> 05:04:26.558 align:start position:0%
answer without yes please so you keep
 
05:04:28.230 --> 05:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
saying it's really not a union busting
 
05:04:31.670 --> 05:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
thing but there really is because and
 
05:04:33.990 --> 05:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
like anything like any other business um
 
05:04:36.708 --> 05:04:36.718 align:start position:0%
say say for instance uh we made it
 
05:04:39.750 --> 05:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
illegal to pay dues to gyms
 
05:04:43.270 --> 05:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
how long would that gym stay open if
 
05:04:44.868 --> 05:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
they weren't able to pay the people they
 
05:04:46.230 --> 05:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
weren't able to pay the bills to keep
 
05:04:48.868 --> 05:04:48.878 align:start position:0%
the building open uh they weren't be
 
05:04:51.708 --> 05:04:51.718 align:start position:0%
able to provide vence to their members
 
05:04:54.190 --> 05:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
and the Machinery went out of date etc
 
05:04:56.190 --> 05:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
etc etc how long would that business
 
05:04:58.270 --> 05:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
stay open and that's very very similar
 
05:05:00.070 --> 05:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
what will happens to union members if no
 
05:05:03.948 --> 05:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
one's paying dues to keep things
 
05:05:07.830 --> 05:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
going my pension could run out all these
 
05:05:09.430 --> 05:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
different things could run out I
 
05:05:11.150 --> 05:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
understand I'm actually happy that our
 
05:05:12.868 --> 05:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
disagreement seems to be based on a
 
05:05:15.470 --> 05:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of what the bill does
 
05:05:17.310 --> 05:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
because your example is what would
 
05:05:19.708 --> 05:05:19.718 align:start position:0%
happen if somebody if we pass the Bill
 
05:05:23.548 --> 05:05:23.558 align:start position:0%
making it illegal to pay dues to gyms
 
05:05:25.190 --> 05:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
this is not what this bill does to the
 
05:05:26.948 --> 05:05:26.958 align:start position:0%
unions it just says that if you don't
 
05:05:29.070 --> 05:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
want to be a part of it you don't have
 
05:05:31.548 --> 05:05:31.558 align:start position:0%
to pay them this would be essentially
 
05:05:33.990 --> 05:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
like saying that you should only pay
 
05:05:36.510 --> 05:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
bills to the gyms if you actually want
 
05:05:38.190 --> 05:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
to be a member which I think is the
 
05:05:40.470 --> 05:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
current status quo in our country I
 
05:05:41.990 --> 05:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't think I would support legislation
 
05:05:44.830 --> 05:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
requiring me to pay membership to a gym
 
05:05:48.590 --> 05:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
that won the uh you know election in my
 
05:05:50.590 --> 05:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
town and now once fees from everybody
 
05:05:52.270 --> 05:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
who lives in town for the right to go to
 
05:05:55.350 --> 05:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
a gym I don't want to go to I will admit
 
05:05:57.788 --> 05:05:57.798 align:start position:0%
that this is not exactly a perfect
 
05:06:00.430 --> 05:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
comparison because there is a legitimate
 
05:06:02.670 --> 05:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
argument to be made that those
 
05:06:05.390 --> 05:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
unwilling people who are represented
 
05:06:07.910 --> 05:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
there by the union do get some benefits
 
05:06:09.708 --> 05:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
and I want to acknowledge that it is not
 
05:06:12.708 --> 05:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
my intent to you know gloss over that
 
05:06:15.510 --> 05:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day it comes down
 
05:06:20.030 --> 05:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
to if this is such a good deal why don't
 
05:06:22.548 --> 05:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
people want it why do they try to get
 
05:06:24.548 --> 05:06:24.558 align:start position:0%
away and by the way we are talking about
 
05:06:26.990 --> 05:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
people who took the whole if you don't
 
05:06:29.310 --> 05:06:29.320 align:start position:0%
like this job go to a company that's not
 
05:06:31.030 --> 05:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
unionized only the have to have the
 
05:06:32.750 --> 05:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
union follow them and unionize that
 
05:06:36.708 --> 05:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
company too how many times do we want to
 
05:06:39.948 --> 05:06:39.958 align:start position:0%
run away until we say I have the right
 
05:06:42.948 --> 05:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
to be left alone if possible now we
 
05:06:44.750 --> 05:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
cannot fully do that because again the
 
05:06:47.430 --> 05:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
federal legislation over rules any rules
 
05:06:48.670 --> 05:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
that we would
 
05:06:51.430 --> 05:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
create but I think we have an obligation
 
05:06:53.750 --> 05:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
to make it better to make it Freer to
 
05:06:55.788 --> 05:06:55.798 align:start position:0%
make it so that everybody's freedom of
 
05:06:57.670 --> 05:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
choice is protected sorry for a very
 
05:06:59.510 --> 05:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
long answer I'm an engineer I don't to
 
05:07:01.670 --> 05:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
go back to Jesus to explain anything no
 
05:07:06.030 --> 05:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
it's fine then if I may yes sir um you
 
05:07:07.470 --> 05:07:07.480 align:start position:0%
kind of answered your own question
 
05:07:09.750 --> 05:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
saying that if you don't want to be be
 
05:07:12.628 --> 05:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
there don't be there and and I
 
05:07:14.150 --> 05:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
understand you're you're saying that
 
05:07:15.510 --> 05:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
well the Union's following that is going
 
05:07:17.708 --> 05:07:17.718 align:start position:0%
to make unionize your company too well
 
05:07:20.830 --> 05:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
we heard earlier that only what
 
05:07:23.350 --> 05:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
9% of the companies or the people
 
05:07:26.030 --> 05:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
working in New Hampshire are
 
05:07:28.070 --> 05:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
union so
 
05:07:31.350 --> 05:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
why why do you think that I me it's it's
 
05:07:34.070 --> 05:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
probably not true um that the Union's
 
05:07:35.750 --> 05:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
chasing everybody around sure they're
 
05:07:37.470 --> 05:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
they're out there trying to use unionize
 
05:07:38.830 --> 05:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
people and I get that cuz they want to
 
05:07:41.628 --> 05:07:41.638 align:start position:0%
grow their base right they want to um
 
05:07:43.510 --> 05:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
but they have every right to do and and
 
05:07:47.070 --> 05:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
and myself being a former uh Union Union
 
05:07:49.548 --> 05:07:49.558 align:start position:0%
boss um I used to talk to Carpenters
 
05:07:52.830 --> 05:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
about um joining the unions and what I
 
05:07:56.030 --> 05:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
found was when they I'm sorry do this
 
05:07:59.628 --> 05:07:59.638 align:start position:0%
testimony or is this a question yeah um
 
05:08:02.590 --> 05:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:05.390 --> 05:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
is they do have the do they really have
 
05:08:08.030 --> 05:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
the right to say no and not be part of a
 
05:08:09.868 --> 05:08:09.878 align:start position:0%
union and not be chased around I I
 
05:08:09.878 --> 05:08:11.150 align:start position:0%
union and not be chased around I I
believe

05:08:11.150 --> 05:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
believe
 
05:08:13.590 --> 05:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's I think that's something we can
 
05:08:15.708 --> 05:08:15.718 align:start position:0%
reasonably disagree on because obviously
 
05:08:17.670 --> 05:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
I feel that they have a right to say no
 
05:08:19.548 --> 05:08:19.558 align:start position:0%
and I would presume based on the
 
05:08:20.948 --> 05:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
questions that you probably feel
 
05:08:22.788 --> 05:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
otherwise which again this is why we
 
05:08:25.548 --> 05:08:25.558 align:start position:0%
have 400 members in the you know
 
05:08:28.190 --> 05:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
Representatives Hall the one thing I
 
05:08:29.628 --> 05:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
will point out though is that you
 
05:08:31.390 --> 05:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we have a rather low
 
05:08:34.270 --> 05:08:34.280 align:start position:0%
percentage of unionized shops in which
 
05:08:36.590 --> 05:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
case I would argue that not that many
 
05:08:38.430 --> 05:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
people will be negativ affected in the
 
05:08:40.350 --> 05:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
worst case scenarios even though I don't
 
05:08:42.750 --> 05:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
believe that you are going to see
 
05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
significant negative impacts because
 
05:08:48.548 --> 05:08:48.558 align:start position:0%
again people react to legislation when
 
05:08:50.708 --> 05:08:50.718 align:start position:0%
you pass a law company adjust their
 
05:08:52.910 --> 05:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
behavior when you pass this law that
 
05:08:55.230 --> 05:08:55.240 align:start position:0%
will affect the way a union runs the
 
05:08:58.590 --> 05:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
union knows what it takes to function in
 
05:09:00.750 --> 05:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
that new environment and they can see
 
05:09:04.110 --> 05:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
their unions from the other 26 states
 
05:09:07.430 --> 05:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
that have this law continuing to operate
 
05:09:09.510 --> 05:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
just look there and all these do and
 
05:09:11.910 --> 05:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
Gloom scenarios simply are not supported
 
05:09:14.990 --> 05:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
by the data yes some of the members will
 
05:09:17.470 --> 05:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
choose to take advantage of the law but
 
05:09:19.750 --> 05:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
I don't I'm not aware of any case where
 
05:09:22.350 --> 05:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
that seriously weakened the union or
 
05:09:24.110 --> 05:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
anything it took some of the members off
 
05:09:26.190 --> 05:09:26.200 align:start position:0%
who didn't want to be there in the first
 
05:09:29.868 --> 05:09:29.878 align:start position:0%
place it you you know I I I would be
 
05:09:32.510 --> 05:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
happy to go you know over more data but
 
05:09:36.788 --> 05:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
I I just haven't seen that kind of huge
 
05:09:38.868 --> 05:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
negative impact that everybody worries
 
05:09:41.590 --> 05:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
about and I would posit to you that most
 
05:09:43.670 --> 05:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
likely based on the other 26 States who
 
05:09:45.510 --> 05:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
did this those outcomes are highly
 
05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
unlikely in New Hampshire I think the
 
05:09:49.030 --> 05:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
unions will continue to operate they
 
05:09:51.070 --> 05:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
will have to be nimbler they will have
 
05:09:52.750 --> 05:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
to work a bit harder to make their
 
05:09:54.750 --> 05:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
members happy which in my world is a
 
05:09:56.788 --> 05:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
really good thing are there any
 
05:10:00.030 --> 05:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
questions rever stop or Schultz excuse
 
05:10:03.590 --> 05:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
me um I'm honored to be confused with
 
05:10:06.750 --> 05:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
her she's great thank you Mr chair um
 
05:10:08.070 --> 05:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
you know we're friends we've worked on
 
05:10:10.030 --> 05:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
some bills together and we also
 
05:10:12.670 --> 05:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes disagree I'm just curious in
 
05:10:15.510 --> 05:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
the United States have you been a labor
 
05:10:18.230 --> 05:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
union member in a job that has a labor
 
05:10:20.708 --> 05:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
union presence because I actually don't
 
05:10:23.190 --> 05:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that
 
05:10:25.548 --> 05:10:25.558 align:start position:0%
question you asked about the Union
 
05:10:27.830 --> 05:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
States the United States oh my God what
 
05:10:30.548 --> 05:10:30.558 align:start position:0%
did I just say you asked about the
 
05:10:33.030 --> 05:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
United States no in the United States I
 
05:10:35.190 --> 05:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
made a conscious effort to avoid any job
 
05:10:36.830 --> 05:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
that would require me to be a member of
 
05:10:38.830 --> 05:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
the union for reasons that I already
 
05:10:40.948 --> 05:10:40.958 align:start position:0%
test about last time when we had this
 
05:10:42.788 --> 05:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
bill and I don't want to repeat again in
 
05:10:45.510 --> 05:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
the you know out of respect for the
 
05:10:48.510 --> 05:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
committee but I don't know does being a
 
05:10:50.190 --> 05:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
former member of the youth communist
 
05:10:52.750 --> 05:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
organization count I don't think he does
 
05:10:54.910 --> 05:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
and for the record by the way while me
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
and my distinguished colleague have
 
05:11:00.190 --> 05:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
worked together on some bills we kind of
 
05:11:02.030 --> 05:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
agreed with each other that we disagree
 
05:11:05.628 --> 05:11:05.638 align:start position:0%
on most of them okay represent McKenzie
 
05:11:09.270 --> 05:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you Mr chair uh the
 
05:11:11.628 --> 05:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
my question is about the construction of
 
05:11:15.390 --> 05:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
the legislation yes specifically on line
 
05:11:17.868 --> 05:11:17.878 align:start position:0%
25 I don't know if you have it uh if you
 
05:11:19.628 --> 05:11:19.638 align:start position:0%
need a minute to bring I can bring it up
 
05:11:24.470 --> 05:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:27.070 --> 05:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
second out of all the windows I had in
 
05:11:29.110 --> 05:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
my browser you'd think I already had one
 
05:11:29.120 --> 05:11:31.310 align:start position:0%
my browser you'd think I already had one
with

05:11:31.310 --> 05:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:11:34.910 --> 05:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
this I'm up and ready go ahead
 
05:11:38.628 --> 05:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
please so the the question I have is uh
 
05:11:42.310 --> 05:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
it's under that section 20 on line 25
 
05:11:42.320 --> 05:11:43.788 align:start position:0%
it's under that section 20 on line 25
section

05:11:43.788 --> 05:11:43.798 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:11:46.628 --> 05:11:46.638 align:start position:0%
273 the right to refrain no person shall
 
05:11:48.070 --> 05:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
be required is the condition of
 
05:11:50.868 --> 05:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
employment become a member or remain a
 
05:11:53.350 --> 05:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
member of the labor organization isn't
 
05:11:55.868 --> 05:11:55.878 align:start position:0%
that currently in federal
 
05:11:58.390 --> 05:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
law isn't that under the National Labor
 
05:12:01.430 --> 05:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
Relations Board nobody can be compelled
 
05:12:04.708 --> 05:12:04.718 align:start position:0%
to join a union or to stay in a union
 
05:12:06.670 --> 05:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
the only thing they can be compelled to
 
05:12:10.030 --> 05:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
do is if it's negotiated to pay their
 
05:12:14.470 --> 05:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
fair share so is this uh is this should
 
05:12:15.470 --> 05:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
this be
 
05:12:18.670 --> 05:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
amended to reflect the National Labor
 
05:12:22.270 --> 05:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
Relations law because this is uh trying
 
05:12:23.990 --> 05:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
this would not Prevail the federal law
 
05:12:26.670 --> 05:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
would Prevail in this case federal law
 
05:12:31.070 --> 05:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
may change court cases have intriguing
 
05:12:33.510 --> 05:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
outcomes you know I don't think that
 
05:12:35.310 --> 05:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
this needs to be amended of course if
 
05:12:37.150 --> 05:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
the committee decides that an amendment
 
05:12:40.670 --> 05:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
is needed I second term so I know full
 
05:12:42.310 --> 05:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
well that it's not my bill anymore it's
 
05:12:43.910 --> 05:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
the committee Bill and anything the
 
05:12:46.230 --> 05:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
committee pleases to do they will do I
 
05:12:48.070 --> 05:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
will be happy to offer a thought but I'm
 
05:12:52.030 --> 05:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:54.590 --> 05:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
anymore I would just one quickly I would
 
05:12:56.990 --> 05:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
just say that you're describing what is
 
05:13:00.750 --> 05:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
a closed shop and those are illegal this
 
05:13:03.390 --> 05:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
language is illegal you can't force
 
05:13:06.030 --> 05:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
anybody to be in a laay movement to the
 
05:13:07.788 --> 05:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
condition okay that's for a committee
 
05:13:10.070 --> 05:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
consideration I I just I'm reading the
 
05:13:11.830 --> 05:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
language and I don't see that we would
 
05:13:13.670 --> 05:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
require it if anything this seems to
 
05:13:17.390 --> 05:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
reaffirm basically tough hardly toughed
 
05:13:17.400 --> 05:13:18.270 align:start position:0%
reaffirm basically tough hardly toughed
I

05:13:18.270 --> 05:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:13:20.470 --> 05:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
disagree the text is there forever you
 
05:13:24.548 --> 05:13:24.558 align:start position:0%
want to see thank you okay any
 
05:13:24.558 --> 05:13:26.350 align:start position:0%
want to see thank you okay any
questions

05:13:26.350 --> 05:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:13:31.470 --> 05:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
stop thank you um I I just looked um and
 
05:13:34.990 --> 05:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
saw that um eight of the 10 states that
 
05:13:37.868 --> 05:13:37.878 align:start position:0%
have the wor highest poverty rates in
 
05:13:40.590 --> 05:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
the country are right to work states M
 
05:13:42.548 --> 05:13:42.558 align:start position:0%
and many of these states have had right
 
05:13:47.110 --> 05:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
to work for 20 30 50 years how come they
 
05:13:50.270 --> 05:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
still have such high poverty rates if
 
05:13:52.590 --> 05:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
right to work is such a great stimulant
 
05:13:55.070 --> 05:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
to the economy and makes life so much
 
05:13:56.590 --> 05:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
better for
 
05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
people how come that Romania which
 
05:14:01.070 --> 05:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
stopped being communist over 30 years
 
05:14:03.390 --> 05:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
ago is still far behind the US in terms
 
05:14:05.788 --> 05:14:05.798 align:start position:0%
of GDP and a bunch of other metrics they
 
05:14:08.110 --> 05:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
became a democracy it is the same type
 
05:14:09.788 --> 05:14:09.798 align:start position:0%
of question right
 
05:14:12.750 --> 05:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
when you start from a bad place and you
 
05:14:15.070 --> 05:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
work towards improving it doesn't mean
 
05:14:17.788 --> 05:14:17.798 align:start position:0%
that in 203 years you will have won the
 
05:14:21.070 --> 05:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
race changes C changing culture changing
 
05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
economic outcomes like that depends on a
 
05:14:25.070 --> 05:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
lot of factors right to work is one of
 
05:14:27.670 --> 05:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
them those states have other factors
 
05:14:30.750 --> 05:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
that are holding them back that right to
 
05:14:33.750 --> 05:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
work can only boo those win you know
 
05:14:36.910 --> 05:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
push those sales so much so this is a
 
05:14:39.390 --> 05:14:39.400 align:start position:0%
positive but we never stated an I would
 
05:14:42.390 --> 05:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
never claim that this is a one thing
 
05:14:45.230 --> 05:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
that will turn us from you know the 50th
 
05:14:46.750 --> 05:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
state to the first state in the nation
 
05:14:48.350 --> 05:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
it's just one of the many parts of
 
05:14:50.948 --> 05:14:50.958 align:start position:0%
economic policy that can be used to
 
05:14:53.628 --> 05:14:53.638 align:start position:0%
improve the economy but it's by no means
 
05:14:57.270 --> 05:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know the answer to every question so
 
05:14:58.948 --> 05:14:58.958 align:start position:0%
it's tough when you
 
05:15:01.670 --> 05:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
start think about generational poverty
 
05:15:05.110 --> 05:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
right I mean people who are born to poor
 
05:15:07.708 --> 05:15:07.718 align:start position:0%
poorly educated families I I come from a
 
05:15:09.708 --> 05:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
country where I go to my Grandma's
 
05:15:11.430 --> 05:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
Village and I see kids who go work on
 
05:15:13.830 --> 05:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
the field at 10 11 years old and their
 
05:15:15.230 --> 05:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
parents hold them from school because
 
05:15:17.230 --> 05:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
they need somebody to you know deal with
 
05:15:19.510 --> 05:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
the land what opportunities will those
 
05:15:21.670 --> 05:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
kids have and as a government you try
 
05:15:23.470 --> 05:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
really hard to reach out and give people
 
05:15:25.750 --> 05:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
those opportunities but you should also
 
05:15:28.548 --> 05:15:28.558 align:start position:0%
remember that it takes generations to
 
05:15:30.190 --> 05:15:30.200 align:start position:0%
really overcome those
 
05:15:32.868 --> 05:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
things I'm sorry again long long answer
 
05:15:34.390 --> 05:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
I don't want to go too far off topic
 
05:15:35.788 --> 05:15:35.798 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
05:15:37.548 --> 05:15:37.558 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
05:15:40.030 --> 05:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
K here and thank you
 
05:15:42.670 --> 05:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
representative uh in those 26 other
 
05:15:44.750 --> 05:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
states where there is often it still
 
05:15:48.548 --> 05:15:48.558 align:start position:0%
seems generational poverty uh do the
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
workers find that they can go into the
 
05:15:53.470 --> 05:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
uh supervisor or the company president
 
05:15:56.110 --> 05:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
and and negotiate better terms and have
 
05:15:57.628 --> 05:15:57.638 align:start position:0%
you have any demonstration of that
 
05:16:00.030 --> 05:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
happening to raise them to raise their
 
05:16:02.548 --> 05:16:02.558 align:start position:0%
salaries improve their health care uh
 
05:16:04.830 --> 05:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities and lift their
 
05:16:07.390 --> 05:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
families out of poverty yes the evidence
 
05:16:09.270 --> 05:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
is in the fact that individuals choose
 
05:16:11.110 --> 05:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
not to be union members and rather
 
05:16:13.270 --> 05:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
choose to find jobs by themselves every
 
05:16:15.030 --> 05:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
individual has the ability what's best
 
05:16:17.230 --> 05:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
for them and when they decide to make
 
05:16:19.948 --> 05:16:19.958 align:start position:0%
that choice I have to grant them the
 
05:16:21.510 --> 05:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
benefit of the doubt that they're making
 
05:16:23.868 --> 05:16:23.878 align:start position:0%
the choices that are right for them I
 
05:16:26.070 --> 05:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
don't know whether those choices would
 
05:16:27.830 --> 05:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
always be the choices that I would make
 
05:16:29.708 --> 05:16:29.718 align:start position:0%
or you would make or anybody here would
 
05:16:32.030 --> 05:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
make but they are their choices and they
 
05:16:33.788 --> 05:16:33.798 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to make them and by
 
05:16:36.070 --> 05:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
the way if they make bad choices there
 
05:16:37.948 --> 05:16:37.958 align:start position:0%
will be consequences that's how life
 
05:16:40.788 --> 05:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
works so to me the only evidence I need
 
05:16:42.990 --> 05:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
is the choice of people not to join
 
05:16:46.110 --> 05:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
unions that speaks to you know the fact
 
05:16:48.910 --> 05:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
they feel that is their best choice
 
05:16:54.150 --> 05:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
follow up yes sir um thank you again uh
 
05:16:55.390 --> 05:16:55.400 align:start position:0%
have you have you not heard the
 
05:16:58.590 --> 05:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
testimony today from the union people
 
05:17:01.548 --> 05:17:01.558 align:start position:0%
who who have said time and time again
 
05:17:04.830 --> 05:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
that poverty was their future and
 
05:17:07.628 --> 05:17:07.638 align:start position:0%
finding that good union job changed that
 
05:17:11.270 --> 05:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
for them them and their families and why
 
05:17:13.590 --> 05:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't this happen in the not in your
 
05:17:15.350 --> 05:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
right to work
 
05:17:18.310 --> 05:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
states this happens in right to work
 
05:17:20.310 --> 05:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
states they are much further behind to
 
05:17:22.548 --> 05:17:22.558 align:start position:0%
start with most of them so there will it
 
05:17:25.150 --> 05:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
will take them longer to catch up I do
 
05:17:27.910 --> 05:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
not know of any data that indicates
 
05:17:30.510 --> 05:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
Right to Work decreases the economic
 
05:17:32.548 --> 05:17:32.558 align:start position:0%
output or the job growth or the economy
 
05:17:35.670 --> 05:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
if anything it increases it so I don't
 
05:17:38.470 --> 05:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
see how you know we could posit that
 
05:17:40.430 --> 05:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
some how it's a worst thing to have more
 
05:17:43.788 --> 05:17:43.798 align:start position:0%
jobs and everything like that
 
05:17:48.190 --> 05:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
now I really listened to everybody's
 
05:17:49.830 --> 05:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
testimony for as long as it was in the
 
05:17:51.548 --> 05:17:51.558 align:start position:0%
room I mean there I have to stretch my
 
05:17:52.868 --> 05:17:52.878 align:start position:0%
legs here and there it's been a long
 
05:17:58.030 --> 05:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
hearing and look I am immensely grateful
 
05:18:00.190 --> 05:18:00.200 align:start position:0%
to the people who came to testify about
 
05:18:02.190 --> 05:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
how this is a great choice for them this
 
05:18:04.190 --> 05:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
is why this legislation does not impact
 
05:18:05.948 --> 05:18:05.958 align:start position:0%
their ability to stay union members and
 
05:18:07.868 --> 05:18:07.878 align:start position:0%
be represented and get all those things
 
05:18:11.110 --> 05:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
they value and fought so hard for all
 
05:18:13.350 --> 05:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
this is doing is saying if you really
 
05:18:15.628 --> 05:18:15.638 align:start position:0%
don't want any of that you don't have to
 
05:18:18.070 --> 05:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
pay for it
 
05:18:21.430 --> 05:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
so you know I don't know how much
 
05:18:24.350 --> 05:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
clearer to make that okay for Jermaine
 
05:18:26.350 --> 05:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
question yes tiny little tiny yeah I'll
 
05:18:30.310 --> 05:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
be tiny jog that so again in those
 
05:18:33.510 --> 05:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
places where even if there is a union
 
05:18:35.830 --> 05:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
and the other few employees who don't
 
05:18:38.150 --> 05:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
want the union for whatever reasons can
 
05:18:40.750 --> 05:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
they go in and and get a different
 
05:18:43.150 --> 05:18:43.160 align:start position:0%
arrangement from their boss and what do
 
05:18:45.590 --> 05:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
they do if their boss says no I keep I
 
05:18:46.948 --> 05:18:46.958 align:start position:0%
want to keep it simple I don't want to
 
05:18:49.070 --> 05:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
have different plans what what's their
 
05:18:51.030 --> 05:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
option then I'm not sure I understand
 
05:18:54.310 --> 05:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
your question I apologize I really don't
 
05:18:56.548 --> 05:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
in the in the rights of work states yes
 
05:18:59.390 --> 05:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
where anyone they could be in a union
 
05:19:00.948 --> 05:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
and yet they were not they're not
 
05:19:02.390 --> 05:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
participating in the union not paying
 
05:19:04.470 --> 05:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
agency fees anything like that not
 
05:19:06.110 --> 05:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
getting any of the benefits which I
 
05:19:07.948 --> 05:19:07.958 align:start position:0%
think they still get but they're they're
 
05:19:09.470 --> 05:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
not participating and not they're not in
 
05:19:11.788 --> 05:19:11.798 align:start position:0%
the union can they walk into the boss
 
05:19:14.830 --> 05:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
and say uh I work harder I work I'm I
 
05:19:17.350 --> 05:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
work smarter give me more money and do
 
05:19:19.628 --> 05:19:19.638 align:start position:0%
they have an option if the boss says no
 
05:19:22.310 --> 05:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
I I I pay everybody I'm doing it this
 
05:19:23.708 --> 05:19:23.718 align:start position:0%
way I'm not I'm not negotiating
 
05:19:25.470 --> 05:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
separately can they be forced to the
 
05:19:28.510 --> 05:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
bargaining table nobody should be able
 
05:19:30.830 --> 05:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
to force anybody to the bargaining table
 
05:19:32.470 --> 05:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
other than obviously the federal
 
05:19:34.190 --> 05:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
legislation saying that unions and
 
05:19:36.670 --> 05:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
employers can be forced to bargain for
 
05:19:39.590 --> 05:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
an individual when you try to bargain
 
05:19:41.270 --> 05:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
with someone and they don't want to
 
05:19:43.670 --> 05:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
bargain with you your remedy is to find
 
05:19:45.750 --> 05:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
somebody who's more amenable to
 
05:19:48.390 --> 05:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
discussing the contract right which is
 
05:19:49.948 --> 05:19:49.958 align:start position:0%
where the whole non- interfering with
 
05:19:51.788 --> 05:19:51.798 align:start position:0%
the right to contract comes into place I
 
05:19:53.390 --> 05:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
should be able to choose who I have a
 
05:19:55.150 --> 05:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
business relationship with whether it's
 
05:19:57.948 --> 05:19:57.958 align:start position:0%
employment or anything else and if two
 
05:19:59.548 --> 05:19:59.558 align:start position:0%
parties don't see I toi look it takes
 
05:20:01.030 --> 05:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
two people to have a relationship
 
05:20:03.270 --> 05:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's business or other topics
 
05:20:05.470 --> 05:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
right you shouldn't be able to force
 
05:20:08.910 --> 05:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
someone to hire you nor should they be
 
05:20:11.030 --> 05:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
able to force you to work for a deal
 
05:20:12.868 --> 05:20:12.878 align:start position:0%
that you don't like both parties should
 
05:20:14.310 --> 05:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
be able to walk
 
05:20:16.868 --> 05:20:16.878 align:start position:0%
away like calculus is derivatives it
 
05:20:18.230 --> 05:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
keeps getting smaller and smaller yeah
 
05:20:21.150 --> 05:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
it's very small this is a micro question
 
05:20:24.070 --> 05:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
a m okay yeah I I'm I'm waiting daed
 
05:20:25.868 --> 05:20:25.878 align:start position:0%
breath just to confirm my understanding
 
05:20:28.190 --> 05:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
so on that scenario that I described are
 
05:20:31.150 --> 05:20:31.160 align:start position:0%
you saying that it's the same option go
 
05:20:32.868 --> 05:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
get another job if you don't like it
 
05:20:35.110 --> 05:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
here that you're that you're objecting
 
05:20:37.430 --> 05:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
to for the uh
 
05:20:41.150 --> 05:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
unions the choice is similar the reasons
 
05:20:43.990 --> 05:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
for it are very different in one place
 
05:20:46.708 --> 05:20:46.718 align:start position:0%
people are coerced to participate in an
 
05:20:49.628 --> 05:20:49.638 align:start position:0%
arrangement they don't like and again I
 
05:20:51.190 --> 05:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
want to remind you that there is a
 
05:20:52.910 --> 05:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
difference between people looking for a
 
05:20:54.750 --> 05:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
job at a unionized company knowing it's
 
05:20:56.430 --> 05:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
unionized and people already working and
 
05:20:59.150 --> 05:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
having a union come in right so it's
 
05:21:01.990 --> 05:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's not all the same right but there is
 
05:21:04.510 --> 05:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
a huge difference when we increase
 
05:21:06.110 --> 05:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
economic freedom when we increase the
 
05:21:08.990 --> 05:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
people's ability to make choices
 
05:21:11.470 --> 05:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
that leads to better outcomes
 
05:21:16.350 --> 05:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
so the choices are always there look one
 
05:21:18.708 --> 05:21:18.718 align:start position:0%
of the huge differences in negotiating
 
05:21:20.390 --> 05:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
as a non-union member and one of the
 
05:21:22.548 --> 05:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
reasons why I would never take a union
 
05:21:25.868 --> 05:21:25.878 align:start position:0%
job is that I want to be P paid based on
 
05:21:28.190 --> 05:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
Merit not based on
 
05:21:31.868 --> 05:21:31.878 align:start position:0%
seniority I want to ask for my own rules
 
05:21:34.070 --> 05:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
for example if I would be looking for a
 
05:21:35.868 --> 05:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
full-time job now I'd probably have to
 
05:21:37.868 --> 05:21:37.878 align:start position:0%
find one that gives me a heck of a lot
 
05:21:39.628 --> 05:21:39.638 align:start position:0%
of unpaid
 
05:21:41.830 --> 05:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
based on the Committees I at right those
 
05:21:43.230 --> 05:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
would not be accommodations that would
 
05:21:46.030 --> 05:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
fit in a Union contract I think limiting
 
05:21:47.750 --> 05:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
my ability or the ability of other
 
05:21:49.628 --> 05:21:49.638 align:start position:0%
workers to ask for those types of
 
05:21:50.990 --> 05:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
Arrangements regardless of whether
 
05:21:52.910 --> 05:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
they're successful or not is bad
 
05:21:54.548 --> 05:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
economic policy and this is why I'm
 
05:21:57.430 --> 05:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
suggesting this bill I hope that was
 
05:21:59.708 --> 05:21:59.718 align:start position:0%
close enough to answering your question
 
05:22:02.830 --> 05:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
I um I hope so yes that's that's quite
 
05:22:04.750 --> 05:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
clear I I don't have another question
 
05:22:09.110 --> 05:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
amazing we're all thrilled no anytime
 
05:22:11.310 --> 05:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
uh any other questions before we're done

minutes representative thank you very
 
05:22:38.948 --> 05:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair
 
05:22:41.750 --> 05:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
members and friends on the house labor
 
05:22:43.750 --> 05:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
committee you've heard a lot today I've
 
05:22:45.190 --> 05:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
been listening since 10: in the morning
 
05:22:46.750 --> 05:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
and I can't imagine what it's been like
 
05:22:48.390 --> 05:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
to have to be here on camera since 10 in
 
05:22:52.110 --> 05:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
the morning so I'll be brief just to say
 
05:22:54.150 --> 05:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
that unions are an incredibly important
 
05:22:57.230 --> 05:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
part to the economy and before we had
 
05:22:59.948 --> 05:22:59.958 align:start position:0%
unions there were workers living in
 
05:23:02.990 --> 05:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
essentially favas company towns owned by
 
05:23:07.310 --> 05:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
the company and when we put in place
 
05:23:08.990 --> 05:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
policy not just right to but other
 
05:23:10.390 --> 05:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
policies which restrict collective
 
05:23:13.030 --> 05:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
bargaining Etc that hurts the economy
 
05:23:15.030 --> 05:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know we heard a lot today just now
 
05:23:18.670 --> 05:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
also about bad economic policy and how
 
05:23:21.548 --> 05:23:21.558 align:start position:0%
allowing unions to do this is back to me
 
05:23:23.830 --> 05:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
bad economic policy is hurting the
 
05:23:26.030 --> 05:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
unions like I know as a person who's
 
05:23:28.670 --> 05:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
worked non-unionized job as a server as
 
05:23:31.830 --> 05:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
a bus boy and unionized jobs that the
 
05:23:33.750 --> 05:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
unionized job gave me a lot more power
 
05:23:37.750 --> 05:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
to negotiate my own position and it made
 
05:23:41.030 --> 05:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
me a able to be paid by Merit because
 
05:23:43.470 --> 05:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
when I'm a sole worker going to my boss
 
05:23:45.830 --> 05:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
and saying I'd like this I'd like that
 
05:23:47.750 --> 05:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
the boss is able to say you're an
 
05:23:49.990 --> 05:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
individual and I don't have to listen
 
05:23:52.350 --> 05:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
but if I go with my union and I'm
 
05:23:54.948 --> 05:23:54.958 align:start position:0%
working a factory job and I have all the
 
05:23:56.910 --> 05:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
boys and girls behind me who are also on
 
05:23:58.910 --> 05:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
the floor working that job unionized
 
05:24:01.390 --> 05:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
then we have the power to make decisions
 
05:24:06.070 --> 05:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
and to change policy collectively and So
 
05:24:08.110 --> 05:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
Right to Work we've seen in every state
 
05:24:10.868 --> 05:24:10.878 align:start position:0%
that past has hurt people's ability to
 
05:24:13.788 --> 05:24:13.798 align:start position:0%
unionize it's opened up the path for
 
05:24:16.510 --> 05:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
unions to be broken down and destroyed
 
05:24:18.948 --> 05:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
and I do not want to see that happen
 
05:24:20.910 --> 05:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I think that we
 
05:24:23.030 --> 05:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
should be helping and aiding the unions
 
05:24:25.030 --> 05:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
more than we already are and this
 
05:24:28.830 --> 05:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:31.070 --> 05:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
direction workers are better off with
 
05:24:33.190 --> 05:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
unions than they are without and I think
 
05:24:35.788 --> 05:24:35.798 align:start position:0%
the fantasy of the individual worker who
 
05:24:38.070 --> 05:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
could go out there and fight for their
 
05:24:38.080 --> 05:24:39.270 align:start position:0%
could go out there and fight for their
own

05:24:39.270 --> 05:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
own
 
05:24:42.470 --> 05:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
Labor uh without the union is is just
 
05:24:45.350 --> 05:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
that a fantasy workers can get better
 
05:24:47.830 --> 05:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
working conditions better labor pay the
 
05:24:49.470 --> 05:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
reason we have weekends the reason we
 
05:24:51.070 --> 05:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
have all these things that we enjoy and
 
05:24:52.628 --> 05:24:52.638 align:start position:0%
celebrate is because of the work that
 
05:24:55.270 --> 05:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
the unions did almost a hundred years
 
05:24:57.628 --> 05:24:57.638 align:start position:0%
ago and we should continue and celebrate
 
05:24:59.470 --> 05:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
that work instead of passing legislation
 
05:25:01.750 --> 05:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
which would aim to to destroy the unions
 
05:25:03.628 --> 05:25:03.638 align:start position:0%
but thank you very much for your time Mr
 
05:25:05.190 --> 05:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and I hope you guys get a
 
05:25:07.590 --> 05:25:07.600 align:start position:0%

05:41:49.080 --> 05:41:50.430 align:start position:0%
uh it was suggested to me that uh we
have

05:41:50.430 --> 05:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:41:53.830 --> 05:41:53.840 align:start position:0%

56 people today and uh and so rather
 
05:42:09.990 --> 05:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
than uh exective today I'd rather wait
 
05:42:12.590 --> 05:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
for a week and give everyone a chance to
 
05:42:16.270 --> 05:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
digest what was given to them to uh make
 
05:42:19.110 --> 05:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
sure that we do D due due diligence for
