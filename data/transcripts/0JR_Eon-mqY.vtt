thank you committee um I'm I come before
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
you to introduce House Bill
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
1562 um as background some of you who
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
were here in 2018 2019 may remember
 
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
legislation that was introduced by
 
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
representative Jason Javin from Seabrook
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
he um was very concerned about an issue
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
in his district where uh personal
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
watercraft that were um enjoying the
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
Hampton seab Brook Estuary were
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
disturbing and destroying some of the
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
environmental features of that area
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
specifically clam beds and Marsh Grass
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
so he introduced a bill to restrict the
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
travel of those vehicle those machines
 
00:20:35.149 --> 00:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
through that area and at that time he
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
brought forward a definition which is
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
you know integral to legislation to
 
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
Define what what is being uh the topic
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
of the reg of the
 
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
regulation um about he defined it as
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft which has come to
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
commonly be accepted in New Hampshire
 
00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
and throughout the world as two or three
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
Cedar individual watercraft so an
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
expansion of the what was historically
 
00:21:09.549 --> 00:21:09.559 align:start position:0%
one Cedar standup jet skis or jet craft
 
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
so he introduced this definition because
 
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
those were the machines that were
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
causing issues in CBR
 
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
Campton and I clearly remember as if it
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
was yesterday the testimony of Captain
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
dunlevy from Marine Patrol who when we
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
were when the committee was questioned
 
00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:31.559 align:start position:0%
ing him about these types of craft said
 
00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:34.039 align:start position:0%
that the statutes are filled with
 
00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
conflicting definitions obsolete
 
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
definitions different
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
terminology and
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
um I got a sense that you know he
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
realized this this was an issue and um
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
on that bill on representative jamin's
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
Bill we had a subcommittee and I was a
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
member of that subcommittee and we
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
decided not to address those other
 
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
definitions like we were just going to
 
00:21:59.549 --> 00:21:59.559 align:start position:0%
look at the substance because it was so
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
confusing so when I had been hearing
 
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
from people in The Lakes Region and
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
advocacy groups about the fact that um
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statutes address the one
 
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
seaters but there's such a gap in
 
00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
statute about addressing the two or
 
00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
three seeders unless it came from Senate
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative Jan's bill which did
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
eventually get passed into law um or
 
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
another bill which pass pass a year or
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
two later from Senator Sherman which
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
applied restrictions of of those crafts
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
in the Rye Estuary and and around the
 
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
New Castle area and some of you may have
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
been on the field trip we took to
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
actually look at that area um that that
 
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
definition of the two and three seeders
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
are not included in statute except for
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
that they are just kind of out there
 
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
they're considered as boats if you've
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
ever seen one of these machines they're
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of fun to ride I've ridden on them
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
and they're great but they are not a
 
00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
boat I guess that's a matter of
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
opinion but um so I I took it upon
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
myself to kind of clarify the statute
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
address some of the current concerns
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
I've been hearing from people and
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
Captain dun love really underestimated
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
how complicated this is in statute it is
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
like trying to straighten out a bowl of
 
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
spaghetti um but so HB 1562 is an
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
attempt to do that and um I do want to
 
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
say that there has been a lot of
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
misinformation about this I have been
 
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure you have to have been
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
getting emails opposing this bill
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
because it's a ban on indivi on these
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft but I want to say to
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
you that HB 1562 does not ban personal
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
watercraft where such banned exist so
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
unless there's an existing ban on the
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
one seeders this is not adding a ban um
 
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
to a lake or water body where no such
 
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
ban exists for those personal watercraft
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
so I just want to state that up front
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
and um to go about
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
the um so if I and I sent you my
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
testimony um on Monday and there were
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
hyperlinks in there so you could just
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
kind of showing my work about um how
 
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
this is going to imp impact current
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
statute so if you go I went line by line
 
00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:36.279 align:start position:0%
in that testimony and if you can on page
 
00:24:40.389 --> 00:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
one of the bill um if you look at line
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
seven8 and nine uh and you'll see
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
there's no new language in this bill but
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
it is it's it's just modifying current
 
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
language and statute so it's taking
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
current language where we refer to ski
 
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
craft and it's changing that to personal
 
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
watercraft um and and but on lines 10
 
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
and 15 um it deletes the definition of
 
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft or ski craft for
 
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
machines that are less than 13 ft in
 
00:25:14.389 --> 00:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
length um and that um hold two writers
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
and it inserts the definition on lines
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
15 to 17 the definition that was used in
 
00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
representative janen Bell um and so it
 
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
it it brings it up to the typical
 
00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
machine that's Now using in New
 
00:25:31.149 --> 00:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Which is less than 177 ft and
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
may have two or three or any number of
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
riders um and then we see more on line
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
18 on page one where it it does update
 
00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799 align:start position:0%
that terminology from to uh personal
 
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
watercraft and if you look at any um
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
commercial or trade Association websites
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
you will see that personal watercraft is
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
the common term um ski craft is used
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
more in referring ref ing to a branded
 
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
machine um so and then line 21 it's just
 
00:26:05.789 --> 00:26:05.799 align:start position:0%
making a grammatical error uh removing
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
the space between water and craft as
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
it's used as one word and it adds a
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
description um of the paragraph for what
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
is going because that paragraph is the
 
00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
prohibition in amher in Hampton sa Brook
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
so it's just specifying what that
 
00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:22.039 align:start position:0%
paragraph is
 
00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
about and on lines 22 and 23 it removes
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
the definition since it is already
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
throughout chapter so the goal of this
 
00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
bill is to move forward on a common and
 
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:37.640 align:start position:0%
consistent definition and
 
00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
terminology of any in personal
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
watercraft that is um used in New
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire waterways um and and propelled
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
by water
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
jet um and then we're I think there's a
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
confusion and um and a lot of emotional
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
reaction is when we get to the bill on
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
page the page two of the bill um you
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
will in the in the first RSA that's
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
modified um there's changes in the
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
terminology from ski craft to personal
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
watercraft this is when it comes to boat
 
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
fees but it only um boat fees are exempt
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
if the craft is less than 10 feet so it
 
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
really this that that RSA doesn't apply
 
00:27:34.029 --> 00:27:34.039 align:start position:0%
to usage as much as it applies to um the
 
00:27:36.669 --> 00:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
the the fees that are placed on that uh
 
00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.559 align:start position:0%
that vessel and then in RS and then the
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
next paragraph it changes the
 
00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:46.039 align:start position:0%
terminology um and it updates the de
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
definition that I explained on on the
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
first page using um the the definition
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
when representative janen brought his
 
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:54.870 align:start position:0%
when representative janen brought his
bill

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:27:59.549 --> 00:27:59.559 align:start position:0%
forward now um the real gist I guess the
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
heart of this bill comes down to when
 
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
there are people on a lake that want to
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
petition the department of
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
safety um oh actually let me back up a
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
27074 um the bill changes the
 
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
terminology from ski craft to personal
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
watercraft in the heading but in
 
00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:26.519 align:start position:0%
addition to existing requirements for
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft 12T or shorter
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
watercraft longer than this but less
 
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
than 17 ft now those machines have to
 
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
apply um or or have some additional
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
regulation that was never applied to
 
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
them before as a personal watercraft one
 
00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
is the operator has to be 16 years or
 
00:28:50.909 --> 00:28:50.919 align:start position:0%
age of older only operate between the
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
hours of sunset and sunrise and sunset
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
require the operator to wear a flotation
 
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
device device um and then not operate
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
where watercraft are prohibited by law
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
or by the department specifically
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
prohibited in RSA
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
270 um sections 75 and 109 and I and I
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
want to point out that those sections in
 
00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
particular because there have been bills
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
um in in in the last few decades where
 
00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
there would be a legislator that would
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
um file a bill that would specifically
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
restrict to prohibit a what we would
 
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
call as a personal
 
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
watercraft from a specific Lake Pond or
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
river so for instance there could be a
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
legislator says I this bill shall
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
prohibit this or restrict this machine
 
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
from Sunrise lake or uh babus lake or
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
something like that a very specific
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
statute and if that passed into law
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
this um and it if it used the term ski
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
craft those larger machines would now be
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
under that statute but many restrictions
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire Lakes have occurred
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
because of a petition hearing a
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
petitioned hearing with the Department
 
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
of Safety and this is where 10 or more
 
00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:19.559 align:start position:0%
residents of a community they could be
 
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
Lake residents they could just be in the
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
town petition the department of safety
 
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
to hold a hearing whether to restrict
 
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
water in personal watercraft from that
 
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
Lake and in that statute for um those
 
00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:37.519 align:start position:0%
hearings the definition that is used is
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
those single seaters it's the less than
 
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
12 feet
 
00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:47.919 align:start position:0%
um um but there's no um ability in that
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
statute for those for those members of
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
the public to ask the department of
 
00:30:56.629 --> 00:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
safety to consider a restriction or a
 
00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
ban on on personal watercraft that
 
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
exceed that length um so what this bill
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
would do would be allowing those
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
residents um the opportunity to have a
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
public hearing with the Department of
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
Safety to enable them to make a
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
determination whether those larger
 
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
crafts should be restricted or banned
 
00:31:20.669 --> 00:31:20.679 align:start position:0%
from that water body at that hearing the
 
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
there's several considerations that have
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
to be made one is the impact that the
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft has on the
 
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
environment the shoreline and Wildlife
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
um to the surface area of the lake river
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
being considered the uses which have
 
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
been established for that Lake Ponder
 
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
River the depth of the water the amount
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
of waterborne traffic but the hearing
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
officer must always and this is in
 
00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:46.039 align:start position:0%
statute consider the necessity of
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
ensuring access to and use of the lake
 
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
Ponder River for all individuals and
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
their rights to appropriate use of the
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
lake so so the the the the individual's
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
right to use that those state waters has
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
to be a consideration in in that hearing
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
and then safety is always going to be a
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
consideration at the department of
 
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
safety hearings so those considerations
 
00:32:15.629 --> 00:32:15.639 align:start position:0%
don't change but now they can be applied
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
to watercraft that have an extra two or
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
three seeds to it and the reason these
 
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:24.200 align:start position:0%
hearings and this part this statute is
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
so important is that every Lake Pond
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
Road River in New Hampshire is different
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
we have a thousand of them some are big
 
00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:34.519 align:start position:0%
and shallow some are small and deep some
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
have a lot of Coes some have are are in
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
an area where there's a lot of
 
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
recreational activity and so these
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
herings focus on the specific features
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
of that water body and its uses and so
 
00:32:52.509 --> 00:32:52.519 align:start position:0%
instead of having blanket regulation
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
across the state on how these machines
 
00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
can be appropriately used and safely
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
used for health and environment these
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
hearings are important because they hone
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
in on the specifics and the uniqueness
 
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
of that water body and I think that's
 
00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
really really important that we maintain
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
this ability in our state to not have
 
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
blanket regulation or blanket laws that
 
00:33:20.669 --> 00:33:20.679 align:start position:0%
apply to everything no matter how
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
different those things are and so the
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
the the nice thing with the hearing
 
00:33:27.149 --> 00:33:27.159 align:start position:0%
officer and that public hearing is that
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
brings in those stakeholders to that
 
00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
water body and it looks at all those
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
specifics of that water body and makes a
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
sound judgment on the appropriate use of
 
00:33:36.799 --> 00:33:37.830 align:start position:0%
sound judgment on the appropriate use of
these

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
machines so I just wanted to update that
 
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
the other regulations um um you'll see
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
there's there's still there's there's
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
one RSA that where the terminology is
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
changed um so that it would pre it would
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
um prevent those larger machines from
 
00:33:57.629 --> 00:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
modifying their muffler system
 
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
to change their noise levels um the RSA
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
270 colon
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
113 that's an important one because
 
00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
that's one of those specific rulings
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
that um bans personal watercraft from um
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
the the Canon Street Lake and that this
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
is where if those smaller machines were
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
banned now those larger machines are now
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
banned because they go back to that
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
definition um and then RSA 487 colon
 
00:34:26.079 --> 00:34:27.629 align:start position:0%
definition um and then RSA 487 colon
16-3

00:34:27.629 --> 00:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
16-3
 
00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
changes the defin the terminology from
 
00:34:33.149 --> 00:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
ski craft to personal watercraft um
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
holding now those larger machines to
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
regulations as far as the spread of
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
aquatic invasive species right now they
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
are not um they are exempt as personal
 
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
watercraft from being um restricted or
 
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
or being in violation of the spread of
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
those um invasive species so I just want
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
to State again that despite right
 
00:34:58.829 --> 00:34:58.839 align:start position:0%
misinformation that you may have heard
 
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
or read HB
 
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
1562 does not ban personal watercraft
 
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
where no such ban existed
 
00:35:10.349 --> 00:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
before if personal watercraft is allowed
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
on a water body it will continue to be
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
allowed um and for those water bodies
 
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
that restricted personal watercraft by
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
Statute those restrictions will extend
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
to the personal
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
watercraft um if hp1 1562 is passed um
 
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
now back in December when I was working
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
on this bill I reached out to the
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety to their attorney
 
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to clarify that if there
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
were restrictions or bans that were the
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
result of the Department of Safety
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
public hearing would this bill apply
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
retroactively so for exence if there was
 
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
a lake that banned the single Ceder um
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
ski craft would would that ban now
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
extend to larger machines and at that
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
time um attorney Christopher Casco from
 
00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
the Department of safy said no that
 
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
there would have to be specific um
 
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
language in the bill that would make it
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
retroactive and I told him that was not
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
my intent and um but I did ask him to to
 
00:36:21.069 --> 00:36:21.079 align:start position:0%
clarify that and provide testimony and I
 
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know if this um I think this
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
email went to everybody um it it came in
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
very you know right before 9:00 but I do
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
want to read um a key part of this and
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
I'll make sure all of you get it um I
 
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have time to print it out but it
 
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
said because there was a public hearing
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
process resulting in the adoption of
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
administrative orders prohibiting ski
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
Craft on some lakes ponds or Rivers a
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
future statute like this one unless it
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
specifically seeks to do so should not
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
replace those rules without a new
 
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
hearing the public is entitled to a
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
hearing before a change the prior rules
 
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
prohibited ski craft not personal
 
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
watercraft and the two terms are
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
distinctly different consequently there
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
should not be retroactive application as
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
doing so frustrates the intent of the
 
00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:14.670 align:start position:0%
doing so frustrates the intent of the
prior

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
prior
 
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
legislation so if there is a lake Pond
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
or river that the public seeks to
 
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
restrict um the use of the person
 
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
watercraft these larger machines even
 
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
though they may have a prior Banner
 
00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
restriction on the smaller one they have
 
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
to petition the department of safety
 
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
there has to be a new hearing a new
 
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
consideration under those those
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
considerations I read to you before that
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
that Banner restriction could go in
 
00:37:47.069 --> 00:37:47.079 align:start position:0%
place on these larger
 
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:51.640 align:start position:0%
machines so um I hope I didn't confuse
 
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
you more I know this is very complicated
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
and um definitely Captain dunlevy was
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
correct in 2019 when he said that the
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
statutes pertaining to this is very very
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
confusing um it it was an understatement
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
but I would be happy to take any
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
questions that you
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
have thank you representative we have
 
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um
 
00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
representative BR um so you're like you
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
said you not intending to ban watercraft
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
did you get uh feedback from uh
 
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
residents that this is important so it's
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
not just a clerical bill but this is you
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
know there's concerns about personal
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
watercraft on New Hampshire water
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
bodies I'm I'm sorry I couldn't hear you
 
00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
could you repeat the question I'm sorry
 
00:38:46.319 --> 00:38:48.349 align:start position:0%
could you repeat the question I'm sorry
representative

00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you um I um what I was
 
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
trying to ask representative Rong is I
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
understand you're not trying to ban uh
 
00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
water C personal watercraft but did you
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
receive uh concerns from um from uh Lake
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
users uh on the use of personal
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
watercraft which is which brought which
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh which is why you brought this bill
 
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
forward yes thank you very much for the
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
question representative um I I've heard
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
from a lot of people about this and
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
there are people um and I I truly
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
empathize with them they they spend a
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
lot of money on these personal
 
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
watercraft and this this this bill is
 
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
trying to close a loophole because
 
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:32.839 align:start position:0%
historically we think of personal
 
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
watercraft in statute as less than 12 ft
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
single seeders some of them are standup
 
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
and so there's been a loophole since the
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
market has now included these larger
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
machines and so people that have been
 
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about the use of the smaller
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
ones that their concern extends to the
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
larger one and usually their concerns
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
have to be around erosion of the
 
00:39:58.990 --> 00:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
shoreline um they they may be um
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
disturbing aquatic plants that may be
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
important to the Shoreline um
 
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
ecosystem um those are mainly the the
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
largest concerns and so the it in their
 
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
minds there's not a difference between
 
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
the single seater and the two or three
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
seater they see that as the same machine
 
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
it's just an evolution of the technology
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
that allowed these larger machines to be
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
manufactured um so that's the main
 
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
concern but those concerns if if people
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
have had those concerns they have to
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
have a new hearing they have to petition
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
again because if they had those concerns
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
and success in restricting the smaller
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
machines under under the
 
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
27074 they would have to go through that
 
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079 align:start position:0%
whole process for the larger machines
 
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
and and then some of the the and and I
 
00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
know people that that use these machines
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
on leges and they use them very
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
responsibly they're not um some of the
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know restrictions or you know um the
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
no wake zone or using flotation devices
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
they're doing that anyway so having to
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
comply with the the regulations we have
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
on the smaller craft I don't think a
 
00:41:19.309 --> 00:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
responsible personal watercraft owner is
 
00:41:20.589 --> 00:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
going to have an issue with that because
 
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
that's just being responsible but now
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
they fall under the definition of um
 
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
machines that have to abide by that I
 
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
did I answer your question okay thank
 
00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
questions representative mq thank you Mr
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
question representative R just to
 
00:41:46.589 --> 00:41:46.599 align:start position:0%
clarify for myself and for the audience
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
this this bill like you said doesn't
 
00:41:55.309 --> 00:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
enact a new ban on lakes where no ban
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
currently exists
 
00:42:01.309 --> 00:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
but it does expand the band the ban to
 
00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
include more types of
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
watercraft boats jet skis pwc's whatever
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
on lakes where a ban already exists like
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
Lake kosaka for for instance and others
 
00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
do I have that correct and it also makes
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
it easier to add bands on lakes through
 
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
the hearing process which already exists
 
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
this adds that hearing process to other
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
types of boats do I understand it
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
correctly uh yes I believe you do
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative so for instance if you
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
you brought up lake kisaka lake kisaka
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
back in I don't even know could have
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
been 89 early 90s went through the
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
hearing process they filed a petition
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
they had a hearing with department of
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
safety department of safety looked at
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
the depth of the lake the size of the
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
lake the impact on Shore and made a
 
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
determination that single SE or ski
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
craft which were defined at that time as
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
single Cedar were not allowed on Lake
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
kosaka now since that time the larger
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
craft the two and three seeders have
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
become popular they're pretty much what
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
you see in the market today um they
 
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
still have full use of the lake I don't
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
know I have not heard from anyone from
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
Lake hanasaka even though I do have a
 
00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
summer Cottage on there I have not heard
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
it is not the concerns about this have
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
not come from anybody on that Lake um
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if people on that Lake
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
would go through the hearing process to
 
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
restrict it we do have those larger
 
00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
machines on the lake I have no problem
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
with them they they go in the Deep areas
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
of the lake they stay out of the
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
shallows um but there may be some lakes
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
that have gone through the hearing
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
process have had single
 
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
Cedar um ski CFT band and now they may
 
00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
they may want to go through that hearing
 
00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
process to have that a ban on the larger
 
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
machines that's really up to them that's
 
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
democracy if the public really wants to
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
have bring change about they have that
 
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity through the hearing process
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
to do that they they can have that and
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
the hearing officer would have to look
 
00:44:16.549 --> 00:44:16.559 align:start position:0%
at all those considerations and one of
 
00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
them is the rights of the individual to
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
have use in Access of that water
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
body follow up so
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
so this bill would would ban those
 
00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
larger crafts on lakes like kisaka that
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
currently have a Chet skki ban right
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
because of the change of the definition
 
00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
it would include them the issue the
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
issue I think you mentioned was
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
retroactivity and that is a little bit
 
00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
unclear yeah um no what what um the
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
attorney from the Department of Safety
 
00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.670 align:start position:0%
attorney from the Department of Safety
in

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
his his uh testimony that was submitted
 
00:44:56.829 --> 00:44:56.839 align:start position:0%
this morning I don't know if all of you
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
got it I got it right before the hearing
 
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
um and I know Captain dunloy is here he
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
may be able to speak to it as well um if
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
a single cedar or the old definition of
 
00:45:11.069 --> 00:45:11.079 align:start position:0%
um ski craft was banned or restricted on
 
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
a lake through the hearing
 
00:45:16.549 --> 00:45:16.559 align:start position:0%
process that does not apply to these
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
larger machines it does not apply that
 
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
was an administrative decision if larger
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
machines should be banned if there are
 
00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
people that want to have restricted or
 
00:45:28.829 --> 00:45:28.839 align:start position:0%
banned they have to start from scratch
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
with the hearing process to do that so
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
this does not if if there's been a ler
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
water body where there has been no ban
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
on the single Cedar this does not apply
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
a ban on these larger craft for those
 
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:50.069 align:start position:0%
a ban on these larger craft for those
water

00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
bodies thank you Mr chair representative
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
Dar thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question just to just to uh
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
use examples like like uh kinaka I think
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
you're saying that since that was banned
 
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
through the RSA 27074 a process that it
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
retroactively um it wouldn't be at
 
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
retroactive but Laurel Lake which is in
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
Fitz William which ski crafter banned by
 
00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.069 align:start position:0%
Fitz William which ski crafter banned by
RSA

00:46:17.069 --> 00:46:17.079 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
2774 explicitly banned by Statue it
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
would be retroactively is that what
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
um yes if there was a specific statute
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
that said this bill bans ski craft from
 
00:46:31.839 --> 00:46:33.950 align:start position:0%
that said this bill bans ski craft from
Lake

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
Lake
 
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.829 align:start position:0%
Lake
X

00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
X
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
and now these larger machines would be
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
banned from Lake X because that was a
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
specific statute on a specific body of
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
water and I would recommend that if
 
00:46:50.829 --> 00:46:50.839 align:start position:0%
there are people that disagree with that
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
that they don't believe that those craft
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
should be banned from that specific Lake
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
um there should be a bill filed to
 
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
resend that statute that's usually what
 
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
we do in in as legislators if there is a
 
00:47:08.549 --> 00:47:08.559 align:start position:0%
law in place that has a specific ban or
 
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
restriction uh and we don't want that
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
anymore we just resend the resend the
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
law followup thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
you again for taking my question so the
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
email that you referenced from um Mr CCO
 
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
um also mentioned that it may be
 
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have an amendment to
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
clarify the um that that's not
 
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:35.720 align:start position:0%
retroactive would you be open to a
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to um to work on such an
 
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
amendment oh absolutely um I would be um
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
because it uh attorney
 
00:47:50.589 --> 00:47:50.599 align:start position:0%
CCO had that opinion in December it's
 
00:47:53.069 --> 00:47:53.079 align:start position:0%
it's confirmed today in this in this
 
00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:55.960 align:start position:0%
document but if it helps the the
 
00:47:58.829 --> 00:47:58.839 align:start position:0%
committee bring more distinction to the
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
legislative intent I would be happy to
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
um another another issue that's Arisen
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
through this and and we have to think
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
that that hearing process that was a law
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
that was uh the result of a bill
 
00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
filed in
 
00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:17.069 align:start position:0%
filed in
um

00:48:17.069 --> 00:48:17.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
1989 by the late Senator Susan McLean
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
and former Congressman Charlie bass when
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
he was a New Hampshire representative so
 
00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:29.079 align:start position:0%
talk about a blast from the past um and
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
in that bill that set up the hearing
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
process it required 10 residents or 10
 
00:48:39.309 --> 00:48:39.319 align:start position:0%
citizens to file that petition and I do
 
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
agree that an amendment could include
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
changing that to 20 um so I'm I'm really
 
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:52.359 align:start position:0%
too I see no other questions for the
 
00:48:53.789 --> 00:48:53.799 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for your
 
00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.839 --> 00:49:18.470 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.150 align:start position:0%
thank
you

you
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
the chair calls uh representative uh at
 
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.789 align:start position:0%
the chair calls uh representative uh at
Coker

00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
against the
 
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman and uh thank
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee so for the
 
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
record my name is Matt ker I represent
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
the town of Meredith in bellnap second
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
district and uh I am uh rise in
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
opposition for uh House Bill
 
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
1562 if you do look down and notice I am
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor on the bill um so I
 
00:49:50.109 --> 00:49:50.119 align:start position:0%
remember I was talking to a local
 
00:49:52.349 --> 00:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
business owner and she said hey I'm kind
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
of curious why are you signed on to this
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
bill and I can't read Pete after she
 
00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
brought up a couple details about how
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
expansive this was and some of the kind
 
00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:03.640 align:start position:0%
of like side roads that this bill took
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
into the 270 74a in the hearing process
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
I I can't repeat exactly what I said but
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
I was like I I made a mistake um so um I
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
generally tried to support uh any
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
legislation that is going to help our
 
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
Lakes out and you know the lakes for a
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
lot of people in here that's their
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
source of income and for the town of
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
Meredith that's a huge revenue and a
 
00:50:28.789 --> 00:50:28.799 align:start position:0%
huge boost to our local economy so I'm
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
always down to uh take care of our Lakes
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
but this bill is just not the right way
 
00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
to do it um the biggest issue that I
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
have with it is it it it it isolates one
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
group of craft that don't I I I haven't
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
seen anything convincing that they're
 
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
uniquely bad for our lakes or cause any
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
kind of damage that um that other
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles don't pose and there are some
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
sensitive areas I believe that we need
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
to protect and I think there's solutions
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
that we can do to protect them but this
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is a hammer and taking from
 
00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
the uh Prime sponsor uh you know these
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
the rsas around this are I think she
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
said spaghetti they're very complicated
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
it's it's really mixed up I think the
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
the original bill was in was put in in
 
00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
1989 um I was three years old in 1989
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
the the the market the for these types
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
of vehicles was completely different so
 
00:51:32.109 --> 00:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
I think just changing a definition is
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
going to open up a can of worms that's
 
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
one unfair to people who bought these
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles with a certain expectation of
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
where they're going to use them uh it's
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
way too broad and I think it's going to
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
really harm law- abiding citizens who
 
00:51:47.789 --> 00:51:47.799 align:start position:0%
aren't causing the problems um again I
 
00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
think a very surgical solution for
 
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:51.640 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
any I guess uh boatcraft that are or
 
00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft that are on the
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
water or any boat that's causing
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
problems in sensitive areas is a better
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
solution than just something like this
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
because again you know I've heard three
 
00:52:03.789 --> 00:52:03.799 align:start position:0%
different opinions from three different
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
lawyers if this is retroactive we didn't
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
talk about the acreage of the Lakes this
 
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
bill would retroactively knock out any
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
lakes that are would knock these um
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
craft off on any lakes that are 75 Acres
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
or less you know then that they might be
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
deep Lakes there's there's there's a lot
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
of just questions that this brings up so
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
I think a better approach to this would
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
be to itl this bill and if there's
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
specific issues that that need to be
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
addressed it should I think kind of the
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
hard task of really reaching back and
 
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.390 align:start position:0%
hard task of really reaching back and
and

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:35.069 --> 00:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
redoing things where there are issues is
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
a much better approach than to just
 
00:52:39.069 --> 00:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
change the definition and just cause 200
 
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
more problems so that's about it if
 
00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
anybody has any questions I'm more than
 
00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
willing to take
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
committee representative Derby thank you
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you representative Koker
 
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
um do you do you believe that um
 
00:53:03.549 --> 00:53:03.559 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft um that don't have
 
00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
sides for example gun gunal on their
 
00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
boats should be um should be regulated
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
like boats or more like similar
 
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
watercraft um you know that's that's a
 
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
hard question I I don't there's I I mean
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
having sides I mean I think that's more
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
of like a safety issue for for
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
individual people
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think it's an environmental
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
issue and this bill is more focused on
 
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
the environmental aspect of it okay
 
00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:36.470 align:start position:0%
the environmental aspect of it okay
thank

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:40.520 align:start position:0%

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
members uh my name is uh Michael Ry and
 
00:54:40.349 --> 00:54:40.359 align:start position:0%
I reside in Littleton New Hampshire um
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
as a a lifelong resident and an Ardent
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
Boer on our state's waterways I strongly
 
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
advocate for House Bill uh
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
1562 this bill is vital for addressing
 
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
the the unique challenges uh that are
 
00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
posed to our state by personal
 
00:54:57.309 --> 00:54:57.319 align:start position:0%
watercraft while ensuring that local
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
communities retain the ability to
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
regulate them responsibly or at least
 
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
have a seat at the table HB uh 1562 will
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
update the definition of personal
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
watercraft and state law and essentially
 
00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
closing a regulatory loophole and it's
 
00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
necessary to enhance safety and
 
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
regulation on our lakes and water bodies
 
00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:18.799 align:start position:0%
throughout the years I've enjoyed
 
00:55:21.069 --> 00:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
various watercraft uh watercraft
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
activities in New Hampshire in fact um I
 
00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
first learned to water ski behind an
 
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
aluminum boat when I was 12 years old
 
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
with an 18 horsepower motor uh I enjoyed
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
sailing uh paddle Bo boating fishing and
 
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
canoeing however over the last dozen
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
years I've witnessed firsthand the
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
increasing challenges and risks posed by
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
the proration of personal watercraft
 
00:55:44.589 --> 00:55:44.599 align:start position:0%
particularly particularly on the smaller
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
lakes and the narrow waterways I believe
 
00:55:50.109 --> 00:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
that Public Safety should be a Paramount
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
concern while undoubtedly enjoyable
 
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
personal watercrafts often off operate

watercraft in New Hampshire especially
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%

00:56:47.549 --> 00:56:47.559 align:start position:0%
presence on many of our Lakes has
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
allowed personal watercraft to operate

crucial opportunity to address these
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
pressing concerns by updating the
 
00:57:15.789 --> 00:57:15.799 align:start position:0%
definition of personal watercraft in
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
state law the bill clarifies terminology
 
00:57:20.829 --> 00:57:20.839 align:start position:0%
and ensures that regulations keep Pace
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
with advancements in the watercraft
 
00:57:25.789 --> 00:57:25.799 align:start position:0%
technology I want to EMP ize and many
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
people have done this already today that
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
house bill 1562 does not impose as many
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
have suggested a blanket ban on jet skis
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
or or ski crafts but it simply out
 
00:57:41.069 --> 00:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
updates outdated rules to allow
 
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities a seat at the table to
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
regulate personal watercraft more
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
effectively by empowering communities to
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
petition uh the department of safety the
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
possibility exists to create targeted
 
00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft regul ation
 
00:57:56.829 --> 00:57:56.839 align:start position:0%
according to the local needs the
 
00:57:59.069 --> 00:57:59.079 align:start position:0%
uniqueness of the lakes and other
 
00:58:01.789 --> 00:58:01.799 align:start position:0%
priorities this legislation Fosters it
 
00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
more of a collaborative approach to
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
watercraft management it enables
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
communities to keep Pace with
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
advancements in personal watercraft
 
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
technology and address the evolving
 
00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:14.039 align:start position:0%
challenges posed by their use on our
 
00:58:17.069 --> 00:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
lakes in conclusion I urge the committee
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
to support HB 1562 and I recommend its
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
passage uh to uh to the New Hampshire
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives as ought to
 
00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
pass by enacting this legislation we can

take a significant step towards
 
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:31.480 align:start position:0%

1562 um I will politely disagree with
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill on what the bill
 
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
actually does when it comes to personal
 
01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
watercraft we believe it does include
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
significant bans and opportunities for
 
01:00:15.069 --> 01:00:15.079 align:start position:0%
future bans on personal
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
watercraft um if the sponsors choose not
 
01:00:21.029 --> 01:00:21.039 align:start position:0%
to uh require the bands on the on the
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill excuse me let me start again if the
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill do not apply to
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
attend apply the current
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
administratively enacted band on ski
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
craft to the broader definition of
 
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
personal rocraft we believe the bill
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
would need to be amended but we ask you
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
not even to go that far let me just
 
01:00:38.109 --> 01:00:38.119 align:start position:0%
start with what we believe the bill does
 
01:00:39.789 --> 01:00:39.799 align:start position:0%
the bill singles out three and four
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
Cedar personal watercraft that have been
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
registered and regulated as a boat in
 
01:00:48.029 --> 01:00:48.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for over 30 years and
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
reclassifies them to the most
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
restrictive category of vessels cons
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
called a ski craft it's a significant
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
change in operation and
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions this is not a simple
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
clarification and a change of definition
 
01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
this is a major change in policy on how
 
01:01:05.789 --> 01:01:05.799 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft are treated under
 
01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:07.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire laws and how it impacts
 
01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
Public Access for those who use them
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
pursuant to house bow 1562 we believe
 
01:01:15.549 --> 01:01:15.559 align:start position:0%
the following restrictions in banss
 
01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
would be applied to personal
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
watercraft all lakes under 75 Acres
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
which there are 390 bodies of water in
 
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
this category would be baned and
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
pursuant to chapter law 283 of the laws
 
01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.190 align:start position:0%
pursuant to chapter law 283 of the laws
of

01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:31.240 align:start position:0%
1988 the first bill on this topic that
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
passed into law was in
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
1988 and that was the bill to Define ski
 
01:01:38.029 --> 01:01:38.039 align:start position:0%
craft and establish those restrictions
 
01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
so all bodies of water under 75 Aces
 
01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
would immediately be restricted and
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
banned to personal
 
01:01:47.029 --> 01:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
watercraft number two operating
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
restrictions there would be new
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
operating restrictions as the sponsor
 
01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
said regarding safe passage instead of
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
150 be 300 in various CES
 
01:01:59.870 --> 01:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
ETC number three it would be banned from
 
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
bodies of water prohibited by law again
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
pursuant to chapter law 283 laws of 1988
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
there are 15 additional bodies of water
 
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
that ban ski craft including Squam Lake
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
one of the largest lakes in the state so
 
01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
are the Squam Lake bands ski craft today
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
under that law it would ban personal
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
watercraft as of the result of this
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
bill and again the the contention
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
different In Contention is banned on
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
lakes pursuant to the hearings under RSA
 
01:02:36.029 --> 01:02:36.039 align:start position:0%
27074 a now in our research of the bill
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
we had talked multiple times to Marine
 
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
Patrol about our reading of the bill
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
that that would be included we talked to
 
01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
a senior staff attorney at OSS who also
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
agreed that that would be included in
 
01:02:48.029 --> 01:02:48.039 align:start position:0%
the bands so I think what I'm finding is
 
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
that if you ask a different attorney you
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
get a different answer so it's clearly
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
not clear there are n 90 over 90 bodies
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
of water that have full or partial bands
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
that were ordered by the department of
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
safety as part of these administrative
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
hearing process those may or may not
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
depending on if there's a potential
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment apply to personal watercraft
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at 390 bodies of water
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
plus an additional 15 plus the Canan
 
01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
Street Lake so there's
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
406 plus these that's almost 500 bodies
 
01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
of water that would be banned to
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft depending ending how
 
01:03:27.269 --> 01:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
you decide to move forward we ask that
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
you don't um I would note about the
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
hearing process we do not favor the
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
hearing process when you look at what
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
happened two RSA 27074 a the hearing
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
process was established by law in
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
1989 between 1989 and 1991 three Summers
 
01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:50.119 align:start position:0%
70 bodies of water were banned through
 
01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:53.240 align:start position:0%
that process so it is a quick turnaround
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
for a petition process personal
 
01:03:57.549 --> 01:03:57.559 align:start position:0%
watercraft are not subject to that
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
hearing process they would be under
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
house B
 
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
1562 so two thoughts on that hearing
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
process one and we've discussed this in
 
01:04:08.349 --> 01:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
Prior legislation before the committee
 
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
if you are going to pass this bill and
 
01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
establish this hearing process for this
 
01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
new type of craft personal watercraft
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
there is no fiscal note on the bill and
 
01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
the department of safety has already
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
said they would need additional hearing
 
01:04:22.109 --> 01:04:22.119 align:start position:0%
officers to accomplish this goal they
 
01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
have one hearing officer in the bureau
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
of hearings that does watercraft
 
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
hearings because there are less than a
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
handful each year this would create many
 
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
more so if there needs to be if you're
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
going to pass this legislation you need
 
01:04:36.029 --> 01:04:36.039 align:start position:0%
to find some money because there is
 
01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill that gives an
 
01:04:40.029 --> 01:04:40.039 align:start position:0%
appropriation for those additional
 
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
staff also on a broader perspective we
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
believe the issues relating to Banning
 
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
access to State bodies of water should
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
be debated in this
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
legislature 6 months of hearing process
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
through the house house through the
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
Senate with a decision by the governor
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
that is what should be required for the
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
weight of taking law-abiding citizens
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
off a state body of water not a one-day
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
hearing with a department of safety
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
petitioned by 10 people with a decision
 
01:05:12.269 --> 01:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
being made by a hearing officer and a
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner that's not
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
fair finally let's talk about the
 
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
history of this issue and why it brings
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
so much passion from
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
voters between the years of 1991 to 20
 
01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:26.599 align:start position:0%
2003 there were at least nine pieces of
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
legislation whose premise was the same
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
as House Bill
 
01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
1562 at the heart of those debates was
 
01:05:36.029 --> 01:05:36.039 align:start position:0%
the definition the proposals to ban and
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
restrict personal watercraft and the
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
rights to Public Access many of those
 
01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
hearings took place in this chamber just
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
as we are here
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
today um I have to admit I was involved
 
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
in many of them I've been doing this for
 
01:05:49.549 --> 01:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
30 years and I started in
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
1995 these bills were fiercely debated
 
01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
and they never passed the legislation
 
01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
so in my opinion the legislative intent
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
is to leave it alone they are boats and
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
they should be regulated as
 
01:06:04.829 --> 01:06:04.839 align:start position:0%
boats in 2019 there was specific
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
legislation to carve out the Sea Coast
 
01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
the estuaries and the marshes it should
 
01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
be noted there were additional pieces of
 
01:06:14.589 --> 01:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
legislation in 2020 and 21 to expand
 
01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
those particular restrictions broader
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
the governor vetoed one of those bills
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
because he was concerned about public
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
access in 2022 as mentioned before
 
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
Senator Sherman brought in a piece of
 
01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
legislation to correct what was
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
currently passed in the 2019 law on the
 
01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast because actually a selectman
 
01:06:35.789 --> 01:06:35.799 align:start position:0%
from the town of Hampton realized that
 
01:06:37.269 --> 01:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
he could no longer use his personal
 
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
watercraft in Hampton Harbor so they had
 
01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:41.799 align:start position:0%
to make sure they corrected that Public
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
Access restriction and made it very
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
specific to the marshes in the estuaries
 
01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
and that is what was become
 
01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
law there's strong opposition to the
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
bill from the boting public as
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
demonstrated on the online portal I
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
think it was over 800 to around 50 in
 
01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
support 800 opposed 50 in support and
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
here's why people work hard today life
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
can be difficult and stressful so when
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
you find something that brings you peace
 
01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
brings you outside gives you a mental
 
01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:15.640 align:start position:0%
health break and time to spend with your
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
family you don't want to see government
 
01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
take that opportunity
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
away we believe that there's no
 
01:07:24.029 --> 01:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
justification for changing the
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
classification of personal watercraft
 
01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
from a boat it should remain the same as
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
it is today we believe that it would uh
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
risk Public Access or ban Public Access
 
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
um impair people's boat in their
 
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
Investments and really turn a popular
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
form of recreation into just Jeopardy
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
and not non-existent so if there are
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
problems we truly ask that we consider
 
01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
further education and certainly we all
 
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
know we need more law enforcement in
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
this state for the Marine Patrol um I'm
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
happy happy to take any questions I do
 
01:07:59.150 --> 01:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
have a copy of that 1988 law I will tell
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
you you cannot find it on the um system
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
because it only goes back to 1989 and I
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
had to go back to the books at the State
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
library to get that chapter law where
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
those bands are in place so thank you
 
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
very much and I'm happy to answer any
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
questions any questions by members of
 
01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.789 align:start position:0%
questions any questions by members of
the

01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
committee representative representative
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
Derby thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so most of the
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
many of the concerns you raised were
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
retroactivity um I understood that uh
 
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
representative rang was willing to have
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
a an amendment or subcommittee to talk
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
about to amend the bill to avoid those
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh retroactive uh retroactive cases
 
01:08:49.199 --> 01:08:50.550 align:start position:0%
uh uh retroactive uh retroactive cases
so

01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
what can you quickly enumerate the
 
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
concern concerns that would be that
 
01:08:58.590 --> 01:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
would not be alleviated by sure thank
 
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
you we to be very clear we would oppose
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
we oppose this bill and we oppose any
 
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that even addresses the
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
retroactivity um for two reasons one
 
01:09:11.789 --> 01:09:11.799 align:start position:0%
there's about 4 six lakes that are not
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
considered retroactive they are
 
01:09:15.789 --> 01:09:15.799 align:start position:0%
statutory bands those would take place
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
immediately as the the Lakes under 75
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
Acres that are currently in statute as
 
01:09:22.590 --> 01:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
well as the 15 um lakes in the can
 
01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
Street Lakes so there's about 4 106
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
there um with regard to the 90 over 90
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
bans that have come through
 
01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
administrative hearing we oppose the
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
administrative hearing process being
 
01:09:34.269 --> 01:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
applied to personal watercraft personal
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
watercraft have been considered boats
 
01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
for 30 years there's no reason to put
 
01:09:40.269 --> 01:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
them under a new hearing process I don't
 
01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
see the support for it and we think it's
 
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
idea thank thank you I one thing any
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
representative who's out of my site and
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
you want to make a you want to have a
 
01:10:01.149 --> 01:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
Lon thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so do you believe
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
that in cases where the department of
 
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
safety through a hearing process has
 
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
already banned jet skis and um do you
 
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
believe that they're wrong and that
 
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
there is there are not situations in
 
01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
which it was appropriate to ban the jet
 
01:10:30.189 --> 01:10:30.199 align:start position:0%
skis or possibly other
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
watercraft I don't think those I'm not
 
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
going to aine on something that happened
 
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.470 align:start position:0%
going to aine on something that happened
in

01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
1989 to 91 I wasn't there at those
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
hearings I don't know what was said but
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
here's what I know when you're Banning
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
people from a state body of water it
 
01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
should be a legislative decision it's
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
not that I we work with the Department
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
of Safety all the time they are some of
 
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
our closest Partners but this is a
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
decision that's meant for the the
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
legislature you're taking law-abiding
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
ciens and telling them they cannot use
 
01:10:59.470 --> 01:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
something on the water I think it's a
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
legislative decision it shouldn't be at
 
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
the department of safety um followup
 
01:11:06.189 --> 01:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
question for a
 
01:11:06.199 --> 01:11:09.870 align:start position:0%
question for a
followup

01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
um but well one I I don't believe that
 
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
we're Banning individuals from the water
 
01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
but uh do you see any relevance
 
01:11:24.189 --> 01:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
to trying to be very specific
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
to not say we're going to have one ban
 
01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:31.640 align:start position:0%
which is not a ban but one set of rules
 
01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
for a very small pond versus Lake wiip
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
pasak do you see any um point to to
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
local control and looking at very
 
01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.110 align:start position:0%
local control and looking at very
specific

01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:11:48.189 --> 01:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
question these are State bodies of water
 
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
um they are held in any any body of
 
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
water 10 acres or more in the state of
 
01:11:53.629 --> 01:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is held in public trust by
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
the state for the use of everyone here
 
01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I do think that the
 
01:11:58.510 --> 01:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
decision- making should stay at the
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
state level which is the
 
01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
legislature okay thanks thank you any

Hampshire a strong summer tourism is
 
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
important for the state as well as this
 
01:14:37.229 --> 01:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
is our second leading industry here in
 
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire bills like H House Bill
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
1562 and House Bill 1390 will ban or SE
 
01:14:48.669 --> 01:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
severely restrict certain segments of
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
our boats from our New Hampshire's Lakes
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
Banning personal water craft ra as a as
 
01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
proposed in House Bill
 
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
1562 is a mistake these watercraft are
 
01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
popular and have been used appropriately
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
for over 30
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
years there has been no outcry of safety
 
01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
concerns among this popular family
 
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
activity wake Sports have also been
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
popular in New Hampshire for at least 20
 
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
to 30 years again with no outcry of
 
01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
safety and very popular among amilies to
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
ban these sports or severely restrict
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
people's abilities to enjoy our state's
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
public bodies of water is inconsistent
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
with the messages that we're promoting
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
to the public there is a better bill in
 
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
the senate senate Bill 431 that seeks a
 
01:15:45.229 --> 01:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
buffer and to help with the safety
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
versus Banning for weight surfing we
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
should prefer this less restrictive
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
policy when it comes to regulating
 
01:15:56.669 --> 01:15:56.679 align:start position:0%
voting activities not the most
 
01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
restrictive choice to tourists have
 
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
means having the ability to enjoy our
 
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
voting in voting throughout the season
 
01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
they can also enjoy a hike up Mount
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
Major or perhaps a rainy day going to
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
the arcade or one of our beautiful
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
museums but again these are choices this
 
01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
is what makes New Hampshire special and
 
01:16:21.229 --> 01:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
attracts visitors to our state if we
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
take away these choices we harm our
 
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
tourism economy which will impact the
 
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and have a great
 
01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
tax again legislation that bans certain
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
segments of voting like House Bill
 
01:16:44.629 --> 01:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
1562 and House Bill 1390 send the wrong
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
message that New Hampshire is unfriendly
 
01:16:49.709 --> 01:16:49.719 align:start position:0%
to boating and therefore unfriendly to
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
visitors these bills could negatively
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
impact the real estate market in New
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people choose to buy a house
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
here and this could change where they
 
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
decide to buy their home with these with
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
these regulations in place less
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
residents mean additional loss of
 
01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
workers which as we all know is a big
 
01:17:12.430 --> 01:17:12.440 align:start position:0%
struggle here in our state these bills
 
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
are not good for New Hampshire not good
 
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
for our local residents and especially
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
not good for our instate and out of
 
01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:19.950 align:start position:0%
not good for our instate and out of
state

01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
visitors we do not want to hurt our
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
tourism economy if these issues need to

01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
you already have heard from a variety of
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
speakers on a few different issues I'm
 
01:20:24.669 --> 01:20:24.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully going to inject a new one um
 
01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
to that discussion and and attempt to
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
not be uh repetitive um and the
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
Chairman's right typically you hear
 
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
about from us about uh roadway safety
 
01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
issues and ohrv safety issues uh the ban
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
on texting while driving uh defending
 
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
safety inspections motorcycle rider
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
education uh but today what I want to
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
talk to you all about is um safety on
 
01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
our Lakes okay it's our belief that this
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
bill will make Lakes certain Lakes less
 
01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
safe in New Hampshire what you will do
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
is in fact increase congestion and
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
traffic which will likely lead to more
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
accidents injuries and even just
 
01:21:02.669 --> 01:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable confrontations be it with
 
01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
someone on a standup paddle board
 
01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:06.639 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft or a larger boat so
 
01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
we all know that our department of
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
safety of which Marine Patrol is part of
 
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
is is significantly underst staffed so
 
01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
this increased burden on them um will
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
will not be a positive scenario so um in
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
the discussions that you all have and I
 
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
hope the conclusion that your reaches to
 
01:21:25.709 --> 01:21:25.719 align:start position:0%
to vote inexpedient to legislate on this
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
particular bill um I hope you'll take
 
01:21:30.669 --> 01:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
that safety concern um in into the
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
decision-making factor that you do so
 
01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
with that being said um I'll take any
 
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
questions if any and also get a copy of
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
some written testimony to the
 
01:21:44.189 --> 01:21:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
committee representative Derby thank you
 
01:21:48.189 --> 01:21:48.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
question um since you're representing
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
the um powers Sports dealers can and
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot about education and
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
how important that is can you can you
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
describe maybe how um the dealers of
 
01:22:03.629 --> 01:22:03.639 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft are um purporting
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
safety measures for when they're selling
 
01:22:09.149 --> 01:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
these craft yes so you know as mentioned
 
01:22:10.830 --> 01:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
um you know safety is a primary concern
 
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
for dealers um we always include at all
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
of our dealers the digests that come
 
01:22:17.629 --> 01:22:17.639 align:start position:0%
from um whether it be fish and gamer
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety that promotes
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
education certain manufacturers have
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
safety programs we do have a Boer
 
01:22:24.910 --> 01:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
education program in the state that our
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
dealers are actively supportive of so I
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's a um it's a primary
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
concern and it's a messaging um that
 
01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
that we always do be it be it boats snow
 
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
machines ohvs um it's constant amongst
 
01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:41.270 align:start position:0%

jet skiis um I was able to see the
 
01:23:29.229 --> 01:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
progression of The Craft and the
 
01:23:31.149 --> 01:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
improvements and also see how they are
 
01:23:32.669 --> 01:23:32.679 align:start position:0%
now recognized as boats in the state of
 
01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's funny to be here
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
today because my dad Mike
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
wall um excuse me for a moment was
 
01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
elected to the state legislature because
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
he felt as other a need for people like
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
himself and his customers to have
 
01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
recognition and support there's a bench
 
01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
behind you uh that's dedicated to him as
 
01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:51.719 align:start position:0%
he was the House minority leader up
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
through 2008 before he passed away and
 
01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
he felt it was a critical element to our
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
state New Hampshire to have Public
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
Access of our parks and our lakes and
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft include those
 
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
they're considered boats in the state of
 
01:24:04.709 --> 01:24:04.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I can tell you a funny
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
story my mother God L she's intimidated
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
by boats and she didn't want to drive a
 
01:24:11.550 --> 01:24:11.560 align:start position:0%
boat with a propeller so she would
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
refuse to take my sister and myself
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
water skiing when my dad was at work so
 
01:24:18.669 --> 01:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
because of jet ski is considered a boat
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire I be able
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
to go for a ride with her spot my sister
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
would water ski and I would water ski
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
and she would spot so because that was

water we sell and service um I'm going
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
to call them pwc's for
 
01:26:13.149 --> 01:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
ease motorcycles dirt bikes etvs and
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
utvs so Valley Motorsports is currently

responsible for providing income to 21
 
01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
individuals and Families so as a
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
business owner I view this bill as a
 
01:26:27.070 --> 01:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
threat to my
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
business while not the biggest dealer in

safety equipment necessary for these
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
units by restricting PWC usage
 
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
on 90 Plus or whatever the number is
 
01:26:54.669 --> 01:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
number of lakes I will be forced to
 
01:26:59.109 --> 01:26:59.119 align:start position:0%
either turn in my um dealer for these

products dealership for these products
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
um and all the revenue that goes with
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
it in due to loss of
 
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
demand as a result we'll no longer be
 
01:27:15.629 --> 01:27:15.639 align:start position:0%
able to support our current
 
01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:20.360 align:start position:0%

01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
pwc's passing this bill
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
will have a significant negative impact
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
on my
 
01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
business my customers and other
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire who find this
 
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
form of recreation affordable and fun
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
will also be affected for those who
 
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
don't own waterfront property and that's
 
01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
quite a few people the PWC provides an
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
affordable and easy way to access New
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lakes and waterways pwc's are
 
01:27:54.990 --> 01:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
a versatile an easily transported way of

allowing people to travel and enjoy the
 
01:28:00.030 --> 01:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
many different lakes throughout our

state don't discriminate discriminate
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
against families who don't own
 
01:28:09.149 --> 01:28:09.159 align:start position:0%

01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
Lakes lastly I know of I know of no
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
study or report that states that a
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft has any more adverse
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
effect on Lake environments than a
 
01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
typical propeller driven craft
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
pwc's due to their Hull design produce
 
01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
very little weight and would affect and
 
01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
would not affect shoreline erosion pwc's
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
are not the reason that algae or other
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
invasive species are
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
spread any more than from other powered
 
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.669 align:start position:0%
spread any more than from other powered
watercraft

01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
watercraft
 
01:28:56.430 --> 01:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
or for that matter the runoff or of
 
01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
contaminants from Shoreline
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
properties I think the thing to do is to
 
01:29:04.430 --> 01:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
focus our attention legislative
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
legislatively possibly on the
 
01:29:11.709 --> 01:29:11.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement and education uh of exist
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
existing laws op educating operators of
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
pwc's to lessen inappropriate behavior
 
01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
any watercraft in in the hands of an
 
01:29:25.790 --> 01:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
irresponsible operator is always going
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
to be a problem I'll open to questions
 
01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:33.560 align:start position:0%

PWC
 
01:33:13.149 --> 01:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
usage through the pandemic we understood
 
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
how important it was for outdoor
 
01:33:16.270 --> 01:33:16.280 align:start position:0%
recreation where people could engage
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
along alone or within their Inner Circle
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
results from a Rec recent Penn State
 
01:33:22.270 --> 01:33:22.280 align:start position:0%
study indicated that nearly half of
 
01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
adults from across the United States now
 
01:33:26.910 --> 01:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
to participate in outdoor recreation on
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
at least a monthly basis and
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
approximately 20% may be new to outdoor
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
recreation during the pandemic pwc's
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
opened the door for so many families to
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
get out on the water and enjoy the
 
01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
beautiful state that we live in and
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
participate in outdoor recreation people
 
01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
have invested in purchasing pwc's and HB
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
1562 does an injustice to these people
 
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
limiting where they can use their
 
01:33:49.709 --> 01:33:49.719 align:start position:0%
machines with our rental company we
 
01:33:51.229 --> 01:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
travel to different lakes in Southern
 
01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
New hampsh Hampshire to the Lakes Region
 
01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
to deliver pwc's to customers HB 1562
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
would kill over 50% of our business this
 
01:34:00.270 --> 01:34:00.280 align:start position:0%
would force us to shut down the PWC
 
01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
rental business the windy juice box is a
 
01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
smoothie truck operated in Meredith New
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that like many others depends
 
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
on tourism as we all know tourism is a
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
large source of income for the State of
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire pwc's play a large role in
 
01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
the tement to the Lakes Region pwc's
 
01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
contribute to over 30% of new sales and
 
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
boat registrations in the state of New
 
01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with HB 156 the decline in
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
sales would be a great would be a direct
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
correlation to the decline in tourism
 
01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
the tourism we rely on as a community
 
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
will greatly devastate businesses
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
Statewide this will not only affect the
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation business but our
 
01:34:35.790 --> 01:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
hotels restaurants gas stations retail
 
01:34:37.950 --> 01:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
shops and the small mom and pop stores
 
01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
will be impacted by HB
 
01:34:42.669 --> 01:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
1562 I can only imagine how poorly this
 
01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
will affect the Lakes Region my industry
 
01:34:46.750 --> 01:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
and thousands of other families that
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
call to Live Free or Die State of New
 
01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire their home HB 15 62 would not
 
01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
only impact my family's business but
 
01:34:57.149 --> 01:34:57.159 align:start position:0%

Bill

01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
committee representative Darby thank you
 
01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:35:20.430 --> 01:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
question um I uh I understood that you
 
01:35:23.310 --> 01:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
Al part of your business is renting
 
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
pwc's um can you talk about the
 
01:35:29.550 --> 01:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
education for um uh the the rentals in
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
particular in particular education about
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
reducing conflict with other water users
 
01:35:37.950 --> 01:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
so whether you're purchasing a new cedu
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
or R we're renting a cido everybody that
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
rents or purchases to legally use them
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire has to
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
have a New Hampshire boers license so if
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
you are somebody that does not have a
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire boers license when you
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
come to rent them we you have to take a
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
license or a test to get your temporary
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
license so one of our employees is
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
authorized to give you the test so you
 
01:36:01.629 --> 01:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
have to take the test and if you don't
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
pass you can unfortunately not rent the
 
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
SEO so everybody that is out in the
 
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
water should have their boer's
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
license and as Mr Mullen said every cido
 
01:36:15.149 --> 01:36:15.159 align:start position:0%
that we sell and or rent we also go over
 
01:36:17.470 --> 01:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
how to correctly use the machine they
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
have all proper safety gear on a on a
 
01:36:23.229 --> 01:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
PWC there's no horn so a whistle a fire
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
extinguisher and um you know a life vest
 
01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
obviously representative har for a
 
01:36:32.189 --> 01:36:32.199 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you for taking my
 
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
question could for the record could you
 
01:36:38.189 --> 01:36:38.199 align:start position:0%
tell us what your average sale price is
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
on a personal water CFT
 
01:36:47.070 --> 01:36:47.080 align:start position:0%
um it's it's right under $155,000 or you
 
01:36:49.149 --> 01:36:49.159 align:start position:0%
know I would say between we have some
 
01:36:51.390 --> 01:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
that range at $6,000 and go all the the
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
way up over $20,000 and then with used
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
product so just uh we obviously sell a
 
01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
lot more new product than than um than
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
you so the average is right around there
 
01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:07.310 align:start position:0%
you so the average is right around there
thank

01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:09.870 --> 01:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
you seeing no other questions thank you
 
01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:15.510 align:start position:0%
you seeing no other questions thank you
very

01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
much chair calls Richard
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
Bono uh for two
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
minutes hello thank you for uh allowing
 
01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
me to speak to you um I'm a personal
 
01:37:30.910 --> 01:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
owner of myself of a personal watercraft
 
01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
and I came to oppose uh
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
1562 um I just like to point out a
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
couple of things I looked at this myself
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
I kind of have a little bit of an
 
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
engineering background I tend to try to
 
01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
look at things logically or at least in
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
my mind um looking at the original uh
 
01:37:48.270 --> 01:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
rsay in the uh bill here uh the ski
 
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
craft mentioned in the original bills
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
they're very significantly different
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
than the modern personal watercraft that
 
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
most of us are talking about and
 
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
modifying this these rules uh most of
 
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
those ski craft I don't know if you've
 
01:38:03.589 --> 01:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
ever been on one um they significantly
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
they operate significantly different I
 
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
want to point that out they tend to be
 
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
designed to be or they originally
 
01:38:10.709 --> 01:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
designed to be very small light and
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
Nimble if you ever see one of these on
 
01:38:16.589 --> 01:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
the water people are doing flips and and
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
tricks and all kinds of things on the
 
01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:21.679 align:start position:0%
water having fun with them um as such
 
01:38:23.589 --> 01:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
they they tend to be written that way if
 
01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
they're if you try to ride them slowly
 
01:38:28.270 --> 01:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
they don't have a lot of control and
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
when I say slowly I mean like in a no
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
wake zone I don't know how many of you
 
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
may be boers who have been on the water
 
01:38:35.709 --> 01:38:35.719 align:start position:0%
and understand that in a no wake zone
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
you have to be as slow as you can those
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
things they're almost sinking when
 
01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
they're going at a no wake speed so
 
01:38:43.830 --> 01:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
they're almost impossible to control at
 
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
that speed and the operator has half
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
their body in the water because the
 
01:38:50.189 --> 01:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
things are sinking at that speed um so
 
01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
that's very
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
contrastingly different than these pwc's
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
the PWC operates as a boat you see many
 
01:39:01.070 --> 01:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
families on them um mothers fathers with
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
their kids sitting between them driving
 
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
along and enjoying the environment is
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
significantly different um the current
 
01:39:13.149 --> 01:39:13.159 align:start position:0%
Mar uh three-person PWC uh has a
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
fourstroke engine which is very quiet
 
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
very friendly to the environment matter
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
of fact mine is EPA rated is uh I think
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
they call it Ultra clean or something
 
01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
like that I don't know all the exact
 
01:39:25.629 --> 01:39:25.639 align:start position:0%
terms there's a decal right on my boat
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
saying how it does not pollute the
 
01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
environment because it's an ultra clean
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
engine like modern engines are the old
 
01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
jet ski types or these these uh uh older
 
01:39:38.350 --> 01:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
ski craft tended to be two-stroke
 
01:39:41.390 --> 01:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
engines very noisy very obnoxious so
 
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
when people saw them out in the water
 
01:39:44.589 --> 01:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
they went oh I don't like to hear that
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
so they're very noisy um so that's one
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
thing the other thing is with the modern
 
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
PWC Mayan I literally there's a button
 
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
on it I can slow this thing down to 1
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
mph boats can't go that slow I can go
 
01:39:58.990 --> 01:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
through a no wake speed so
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
slow boats behind me are almost honking
 
01:40:03.229 --> 01:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
their horns saying get out of my way
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
because they can't go that slow they
 
01:40:06.270 --> 01:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
have to put their engines into neutral
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
to go as slow as I can I can hover in
 
01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
one spot it does not disturb the
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
environment it does not make a lot of
 
01:40:14.510 --> 01:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
noise you wouldn't even hear me come up
 
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
behind you if you if if if I did uh
 
01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
they're very quiet um so I'd like to
 
01:40:21.589 --> 01:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
really emphasize this point the
 
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
difference between these older ski craft
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
which the original rsas uh uh had made
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
rules for because of many of these
 
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
concerns about speed noise uh pollution
 
01:40:37.709 --> 01:40:37.719 align:start position:0%
and so forth the modern pwc's do not
 
01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
have that problem they're very quiet and
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
efficient and can be ridden very very
 
01:40:45.149 --> 01:40:45.159 align:start position:0%
slowly matter of fact uh um I'd invite
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
any of you if you wanted to witness this
 
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
yourselves it's not the right time of
 
01:40:50.589 --> 01:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
year now but come on up in the summer
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to take you for a ride and
 
01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
let you experience this yourself because
 
01:40:56.669 --> 01:40:56.679 align:start position:0%
they are very quiet fun and so forth
 
01:41:00.189 --> 01:41:00.199 align:start position:0%
when operated safely um as as the PE
 
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
other people have mentioned you need
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
your uh life jacket and other safety
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
equipment um I strongly oppose this 1592
 
01:41:12.669 --> 01:41:12.679 align:start position:0%
1562 I'm sorry any questions I'll be
 
01:41:16.109 --> 01:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
happy to answer from a average
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
user any questions by members of the
 
01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:22.229 align:start position:0%
user any questions by members of the
committee

01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:41:28.589 --> 01:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
Sports good morning and thank you for
 
01:41:39.669 --> 01:41:39.679 align:start position:0%
giving us this opportunity to speak
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
today regarding HB
 
01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
1562 I'm Lisa miles um one of the owners
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
of HK Power Sports in hookit and Laconia
 
01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh 48 years ago my father Steve Wally
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
and John's father Mike Wall-E opened our
 
01:41:54.189 --> 01:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
power sports business and we've been
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
doing business selling Power Sports in
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire since
 
01:42:02.589 --> 01:42:02.599 align:start position:0%
1976 um I actually was here 25ish years
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
ago and helped jod actually demonstrate
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
on the lake uh the differences between
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
these one passenger and two passenger
 
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
machines versus these three passenger
 
01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:13.639 align:start position:0%
machines and why they are considered
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
boats um that obviously never passed
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
then and in my opinion should not pass
 
01:42:22.990 --> 01:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
now and I am here to oppose HB
 
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
1562 this proposed bill would
 
01:42:27.149 --> 01:42:27.159 align:start position:0%
drastically change the ability to use a
 
01:42:29.589 --> 01:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
PWC in the state of New Hampshire today
 
01:42:31.950 --> 01:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
three passenger watercraft which are 90%
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the personal watercraft that we sell
 
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
are considered boats in New Hampshire
 
01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
which is a huge difference between a one
 
01:42:39.709 --> 01:42:39.719 align:start position:0%
and two passenger that is considered a
 
01:42:39.719 --> 01:42:41.030 align:start position:0%
and two passenger that is considered a
ski

01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
ski
 
01:42:42.910 --> 01:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
craft I would like to point out that
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
three seeder personal watercraft make up
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
30% of new boat sales in the state of
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which is a very large
 
01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:51.669 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which is a very large
number

01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
they're popular because they are very
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
affordable low maintenance easy to use
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
and easy to transport to smaller Lakes
 
01:42:59.709 --> 01:42:59.719 align:start position:0%
if you aren't on the
 
01:43:02.430 --> 01:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
waterfront um people purchase them now
 
01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
even for fishing um people use them to
 
01:43:06.910 --> 01:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
go out to dinner you don't get wet on
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
them anymore and they're extremely
 
01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
environmentally friendly than even 30
 
01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.109 align:start position:0%
environmentally friendly than even 30
years

01:43:14.109 --> 01:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
ago pwcs are safe and have no risk of
 
01:43:19.709 --> 01:43:19.719 align:start position:0%
propeller injuries like other boats and
 
01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
they're easy to get on and off of um
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
people water ski behind them and tow
 
01:43:25.709 --> 01:43:25.719 align:start position:0%
behind them learn how to water ski on
 
01:43:27.950 --> 01:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
them we've done law loan programs with
 
01:43:29.790 --> 01:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
fire departments for rescue because
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
these machines can get into places that
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
other machines cannot for years we sold
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
um watercraft to a program that UNH puts
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
on for teaching people with disabilities
 
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
how to water ski and they had to have
 
01:43:45.149 --> 01:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
two watercraft to be able to get people
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
um up water ski or back into the
 
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
boat in 2023 our two stores alone sold
 
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
over 600 personal watercrafts in one
 
01:43:57.550 --> 01:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
year because they are considered boats
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
we sell very few one and two passenger
 
01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
ski craft we sell mostly the three
 
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
passenger and people seek them out
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
because they are considered boats and
 
01:44:08.669 --> 01:44:08.679 align:start position:0%
because they are affordable to use our
 
01:44:11.629 --> 01:44:11.639 align:start position:0%
average price is about $144,000 so
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
people can get on the lake in a boat
 
01:44:15.790 --> 01:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
with three passengers for
 
01:44:18.270 --> 01:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
$14,000 changing this law would hugely
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
limit how these families could get
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
accesses to lakes and New Hampshire the
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
result of limiting their use not only is
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
one of the many restrictions being
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
considered for boating in New Hampshire
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
but will affect the economy on and
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
around all of the lakes in this state
 
01:44:32.910 --> 01:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
with the ever growing costs associated
 
01:44:34.510 --> 01:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
with boating and lakefront homes
 
01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft have remained the
 
01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
most affordable boat to purchase and use
 
01:44:40.109 --> 01:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
on many New Hampshire lakes and they
 
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
would be restricted on these smaller
 
01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
lakes that you cannot use a one and two
 
01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:45.870 align:start position:0%
lakes that you cannot use a one and two
passenger

01:44:45.870 --> 01:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
passenger
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
watercraft I'd also like to speak on how
 
01:44:50.910 --> 01:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft operate mechanically
 
01:44:52.629 --> 01:44:52.639 align:start position:0%
so everyone has an idea of how they work
 
01:44:55.229 --> 01:44:55.239 align:start position:0%
when considering the environmental
 
01:44:58.229 --> 01:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
effects pwcs are fourstroke three
 
01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
passenger crafts with a jet drive system
 
01:45:02.589 --> 01:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
that is completely inside the hull
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
there's no exposed prop there's no lower
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
unit they draft only 11 Ines of water
 
01:45:09.550 --> 01:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
when they're sitting and even less when
 
01:45:12.270 --> 01:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
they're moving so you you have nothing
 
01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
hanging into the water and disturbing
 
01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
aquatic plant life the the propulsion is
 
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
at the very surface of the water and
 
01:45:21.589 --> 01:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
they're very light craft so they do not
 
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
boats please consider the large effect
 
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
that hb1 1562 will have on boating and
 
01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
recreating in New Hampshire and how it
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
would affect the economy if personal
 
01:45:36.910 --> 01:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
watercraft are subject to the ski craft
 
01:45:39.629 --> 01:45:39.639 align:start position:0%
restrictions and bans of the past and
 
01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
then be open to more restrictions and
 
01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
bans through the hearing process in the
 
01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
future it singles them out for different
 
01:45:47.149 --> 01:45:47.159 align:start position:0%
treatment than other boats I compare it
 
01:45:49.950 --> 01:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
to if we wanted to restrict motorcycles
 
01:45:51.149 --> 01:45:51.159 align:start position:0%
on certain certain roads in New
 
01:45:52.950 --> 01:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it just doesn't make
 
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
sense it will severely limit
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
accessibility on more than half of New
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lakes and continue to take
 
01:46:00.589 --> 01:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
away boting rights in New Hampshire
 
01:46:00.599 --> 01:46:02.910 align:start position:0%
away boting rights in New Hampshire

give a little background on myself um
 
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
when I was little around 10 years old my
 
01:46:41.790 --> 01:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
family being an only child tried hard to
 
01:46:43.709 --> 01:46:43.719 align:start position:0%
get me into boating nothing I ever
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
do um with them uh 1999 we purchased our
 
01:46:52.109 --> 01:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
first PWC and they figured maybe I would
 
01:46:53.550 --> 01:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
like going on the water with my mom and
 
01:46:59.149 --> 01:46:59.159 align:start position:0%
my dad doing that um and immediately I
 
01:47:01.709 --> 01:47:01.719 align:start position:0%
did like that um we were able to go out
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
on a variety of different lakes growing
 
01:47:05.589 --> 01:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
up we were never having a waterfront
 
01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
property so we would always have to
 
01:47:10.669 --> 01:47:10.679 align:start position:0%
trailer our boat or
 
01:47:14.669 --> 01:47:14.679 align:start position:0%
PWC uh to each launch um so my family
 
01:47:16.589 --> 01:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
were able to do that we went to a
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
variety of lakes a variety of lakes that
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
would be under the new band um we would
 
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
go to walki WAN in Meredith we would go
 
01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
to Squam Lake um and so on so it
 
01:47:31.149 --> 01:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
provided my family and I a great way of
 
01:47:33.790 --> 01:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
getting out um something I did all
 
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
through High School uh and even College
 
01:47:38.189 --> 01:47:38.199 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why I went to
 
01:47:40.189 --> 01:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State University was so that my
 
01:47:43.229 --> 01:47:43.239 align:start position:0%
friends and I could still go out on the
 
01:47:46.830 --> 01:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
water um May and uh in the fall
 
01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:49.639 align:start position:0%
September uh when school is in session a
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
lot of the younger uh my younger friends
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
were able to purchase pwc's financially
 
01:47:57.950 --> 01:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
over a boat um it's something growing up
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
that I was able to purchase myself even
 
01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:04.360 align:start position:0%
through college um my average PWC cost
 
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh was around $5,000 per machine at the
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
time um so owning a boat if it wasn't
 
01:48:13.149 --> 01:48:13.159 align:start position:0%
for PWC wouldn't be an option for me um
 
01:48:16.030 --> 01:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
even once I met my wife uh we would go
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
out do our day trips um just provided so
 
01:48:21.390 --> 01:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
much entertainment for just her and I to
 
01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
just go to a lake go out for the day and
 
01:48:26.189 --> 01:48:26.199 align:start position:0%
then be able to Trail her back home and
 
01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
not have the extra cost of a boat um now
 
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
I have two young children both actually
 
01:48:35.470 --> 01:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
prefer going out on pwc's over our
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
family boat now that we have um they
 
01:48:40.270 --> 01:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
like that usually I'll take my daughter
 
01:48:42.589 --> 01:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
out who's seven and my wife will take my
 
01:48:45.870 --> 01:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
son out who's five and uh on a separate
 
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
machine um and we have a great day doing
 
01:48:49.950 --> 01:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
that so they actually prefer going out
 
01:48:53.589 --> 01:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
on the pwc's over the boat um the other
 
01:48:55.870 --> 01:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
thing too is my wife who got her boers
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
license about 10 years ago I got mine
 
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
immediately when I turned 16 um she got
 
01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
hers about 10 years ago she can't drive
 
01:49:05.709 --> 01:49:05.719 align:start position:0%
a boat to save her life um with the
 
01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
motor the steering wheel boats are a lot
 
01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
harder to drive than pwc's and she can
 
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
drive a PWC very comfortably um most new
 
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
ones have brakes on them which boats
 
01:49:20.709 --> 01:49:20.719 align:start position:0%
don't have um so her being able to take
 
01:49:23.790 --> 01:49:23.800 align:start position:0%
my son out or um eventually as they get
 
01:49:27.390 --> 01:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
a little bit older um is possible due to
 
01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
a PWC she can't drive a boat even to
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
this day um so just about the financial
 
01:49:36.990 --> 01:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
uh cost uh of it you know being a young
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
middle class having a young middle-
 
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
class family it's something we can do on
 
01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
the Waterway we could not do it um most
 
01:49:47.149 --> 01:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
of my late teens and early 20s if there
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't for PWC just I think with the
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
average price of a boat plus needing a
 
01:49:52.709 --> 01:49:52.719 align:start position:0%
bigger vehicle to Trail her to the
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
different ramps and everything like that
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
so it just wouldn't have been
 
01:50:00.270 --> 01:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
possible um I think another thing too is
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
some of my friends that got pwc's around
 
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
the same time I did they now boat so
 
01:50:09.870 --> 01:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
pwcs is also a nice entry way for um
 
01:50:11.950 --> 01:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
boating or it gives more of like that
 
01:50:14.109 --> 01:50:14.119 align:start position:0%
middle class family a sense of being out
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
on the water that wouldn't be possible
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
without a
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
PWC um in terms of
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
also use I can be out on my PWC for
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
almost an entire day for around $50 in
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
fuel um a boat is at least double that
 
01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
same thing with insurance same thing
 
01:50:34.589 --> 01:50:34.599 align:start position:0%
with a vehicle to tow uh to the launch
 
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
um so it's just all around cheaper I do
 
01:50:40.990 --> 01:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
believe it's safer um obviously I I
 
01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
believe the law is uh children under 12
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
have to wear a life jacket if they're in
 
01:50:47.709 --> 01:50:47.719 align:start position:0%
the boat or on a PWC well everyone on
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
the PWC is wear life jackets um so if an
 
01:50:54.189 --> 01:50:54.199 align:start position:0%
accident was to ever occur you know you
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
have a life jacket on a boat you don't
 
01:50:58.990 --> 01:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh yearly I'll hear about uh boating
 
01:51:01.069 --> 01:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
fatalities because maybe a person fell
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
overboard and they drowned um maybe the
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
um propeller on the boat um every year
 
01:51:09.149 --> 01:51:09.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you hear about a a young
 
01:51:12.510 --> 01:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
child that usually is a fatality because
 
01:51:14.350 --> 01:51:14.360 align:start position:0%
they get caught in the prop of the boat
 
01:51:17.149 --> 01:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
with pwcs that doesn't happen um I don't
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
know the statistics off the top of my
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
head but I know very few PWC accidents
 
01:51:23.149 --> 01:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
per year even I think if there was a
 
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
study done on
 
01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
that um I think that's really it I just
 
01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to just provide a little bit of
 
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
perspective from somebody that really
 
01:51:34.189 --> 01:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
didn't like boating growing up as a
 
01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
child I was able to do it with my family
 
01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
immediately when they we purchased our
 
01:51:40.510 --> 01:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
first one and then all the way through
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
now I know my family still prefers it
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
now um with our hectic lifestyle being
 
01:51:49.709 --> 01:51:49.719 align:start position:0%
able to easily go out after work or um
 
01:51:50.910 --> 01:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
you you know with the family is
 
01:51:54.149 --> 01:51:54.159 align:start position:0%
something we can do and especially under
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
this new bill there would be lakes that
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we can't go to that my
 
01:51:59.669 --> 01:51:59.679 align:start position:0%
children do like going to whether it be
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
Squam Lake Lake
 
01:52:03.870 --> 01:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
wakwan um and a variety of other lakes
 
01:52:06.750 --> 01:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
and rivers um that we use
 
01:52:10.069 --> 01:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
currently any questions any questions by
 
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.560 align:start position:0%

chair thank you uh Captain for taking my
 
01:53:43.149 --> 01:53:43.159 align:start position:0%
question um I we've heard about some
 
01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
concerns that this bill would ban um uh
 
01:53:52.270 --> 01:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
ski Craft on lakes under 75 Acres from a
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
1988 law I looked at the um Department's
 
01:54:00.149 --> 01:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
list of lakes where ski craftter banned
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
both by Statute as well as by um as the
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
hearing process and I only see 15 lakes
 
01:54:11.669 --> 01:54:11.679 align:start position:0%
that are banned by Statute um the vast
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
majority would be banned by of ski craft
 
01:54:16.589 --> 01:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
are banned
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
by the uh the hearing process are you
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
aware of other restrictions that would
 
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
apply that would have ban that would ban
 
01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
um personal watercraft based on this
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:35.589 --> 01:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
Acres I am not uh there are legal
 
01:54:38.910 --> 01:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
opinions out there as to retroactivity
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not a legal Mind by any means so
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh I would defer to them on that uh but
 
01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any other restrictions
 
01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
that would would uh take
 
01:54:48.679 --> 01:54:51.069 align:start position:0%
that would would uh take
place

01:54:51.069 --> 01:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:54:54.030 --> 01:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
for a followup thank you Mr chair just
 
01:54:56.430 --> 01:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
just um to make sure I'm we're talking
 
01:54:59.669 --> 01:54:59.679 align:start position:0%
about the same thing um there's the the
 
01:55:01.870 --> 01:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
department publishes restricted bodies
 
01:55:05.790 --> 01:55:05.800 align:start position:0%
of water that lists um lakes that don't
 
01:55:09.629 --> 01:55:09.639 align:start position:0%
allow um petroleum uh Outboards for
 
01:55:13.629 --> 01:55:13.639 align:start position:0%
example or um or have speed limits or
 
01:55:16.350 --> 01:55:16.360 align:start position:0%
number of other criteria is that the
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
would is is it safe to assume that the
 
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
department of safety uh does their
 
01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement based on that
 
01:55:26.950 --> 01:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
list yes so if a personal watercraft or
 
01:55:29.229 --> 01:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
a ski craft or an outboard motor an
 
01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
inboard motor where to fall into a
 
01:55:34.629 --> 01:55:34.639 align:start position:0%
category of uh a body of water that is
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
restricted by horsepower or by speed
 
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
limit that is going to apply to all
 
01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
Craft um specifically to personal
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
watercraft or ski Craft um again absent
 
01:55:50.430 --> 01:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
the retroactivity uh concerns
 
01:55:53.589 --> 01:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
um those those restrictions are in place
 
01:55:56.910 --> 01:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
specific to craft uh identified by
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
either the commissioner or by the
 
01:56:00.310 --> 01:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
legislature if that answers your
 
01:56:01.629 --> 01:56:01.639 align:start position:0%
question sir I'm not trying to dodge
 
01:56:05.229 --> 01:56:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:08.189 --> 01:56:08.199 align:start position:0%
just just take resp for another for
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
another F thank you um right I I was I
 
01:56:14.589 --> 01:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
was incomplete it also that same um
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
website also lists the the personal
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
water or the the ski craft the the
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
bodies of water that ban ski craft I was
 
01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:23.639 align:start position:0%
just using that as other examples it's
 
01:56:26.189 --> 01:56:26.199 align:start position:0%
sort of comprehensive but I but my
 
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
follow I try to keep it short I know
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
you're um we've all been here for a
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
the we've heard that personal watercraft
 
01:56:42.430 --> 01:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
not um differentiated from ski Craft um
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
are really distinct from ski
 
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
craft as I understand the um the
 
01:56:52.750 --> 01:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
safety regulations safety restrictions
 
01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
with respect to boats which I guess this
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
Falls within only um only uh riders or
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
operators um 12 years old and under
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
would need to wear a um life jacket
 
01:57:07.470 --> 01:57:07.480 align:start position:0%
although one would have to be on board
 
01:57:10.830 --> 01:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
and um it appears that if the uh
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft has a motor
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
equivalent to under 25 horsepower than
 
01:57:19.589 --> 01:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
somebody under 16 years of age could
 
01:57:22.149 --> 01:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
also operate a personal watercraft can
 
01:57:25.709 --> 01:57:25.719 align:start position:0%
you comment on those safety measures for
 
01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:28.719 align:start position:0%
with respect to personal
 
01:57:33.790 --> 01:57:33.800 align:start position:0%
watercraft so as the crafts are defined
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
today a two person machine a one and two
 
01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:40.360 align:start position:0%
person machine is required by Statute to
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
have the operator wearing a life jacket
 
01:57:44.910 --> 01:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
while in
 
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
operation because any machine with a
 
01:57:50.950 --> 01:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
capacity of three or more it is
 
01:57:53.629 --> 01:57:53.639 align:start position:0%
considered a boat and unless you are 12
 
01:57:56.189 --> 01:57:56.199 align:start position:0%
years of age and under then you are not
 
01:57:58.750 --> 01:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
required to wear the life jacket but you
 
01:58:04.430 --> 01:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:08.750 --> 01:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
use and the other part of that was the
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
as I understand the restriction on age
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
limits for
 
01:58:12.239 --> 01:58:14.069 align:start position:0%
limits for
watercraft

01:58:14.069 --> 01:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
watercraft
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
um uh people 16 years or older are
 
01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
restricted for 25 horsepower or above
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
but not for smaller horsepower boats so
 
01:58:27.830 --> 01:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
how does that apply to these threers uh
 
01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:29.270 align:start position:0%
how does that apply to these threers uh
personal

01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
personal
 
01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
watercraft so a three person personal
 
01:58:34.270 --> 01:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
watercraft I'm not aware of any that are
 
01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
less than 25
 
01:58:38.669 --> 01:58:38.679 align:start position:0%
horsepower uh so if a child someone
 
01:58:41.069 --> 01:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
under the age of 16 wants to operate
 
01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
that like any other boat they have to
 
01:58:46.709 --> 01:58:46.719 align:start position:0%
have a responsible adult on board 18 and
 
01:58:49.310 --> 01:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
over with them who is also serving
 
01:58:51.709 --> 01:58:51.719 align:start position:0%
certified and had has taken the safety
 
01:58:55.310 --> 01:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
course it's only uh that is the caveat
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
that exists for a person under 16 to
 
01:59:10.589 --> 01:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:13.629 --> 01:59:13.639 align:start position:0%
machines dony for a
 
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:59:19.870 --> 01:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Captain um noted
 
01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
earlier from jod from Marine Association
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
she mentioned there's no fiscal note to
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill do you in your
 
01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
professional opinion do you think this
 
01:59:31.629 --> 01:59:31.639 align:start position:0%
will increase your staff's um
 
01:59:33.950 --> 01:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
requirements for Marine Patrol and do
 
01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
you have enough staff to be able to
 
01:59:40.069 --> 01:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
manage this bill with the new
 
01:59:42.390 --> 01:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
requirements currently we are managing
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions at exist
 
01:59:48.270 --> 01:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
today again absent the you know whether
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about retro active or not
 
01:59:54.109 --> 01:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
any new uh additions are going to be
 
01:59:57.069 --> 01:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
treated by our Patrol staff uh on a Case
 
02:00:00.350 --> 02:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
by case basis call by call basis I think
 
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
what has been discussed earlier would be
 
02:00:04.589 --> 02:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
the impact on the hearings Bureau within
 
02:00:05.830 --> 02:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
the department of
 
02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
safety uh if there
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
are circumstances where new restrictions
 
02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
are looking to be
 
02:00:19.950 --> 02:00:19.960 align:start position:0%
added to existing restrictions
 
02:00:21.990 --> 02:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
then certainly depending upon the
 
02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
Public's wish to have a body of water
 
02:00:26.790 --> 02:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
considered for a restriction may
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
increase the demand on the hearings
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
Bureau that's undetermined that's that's
 
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
going to be based on what a body of
 
02:00:35.589 --> 02:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
water at the local level is going to
 
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
want uh for or not want on their bodies
 
02:00:44.109 --> 02:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
restriction before we go on I'd like to
 
02:00:51.149 --> 02:00:51.159 align:start position:0%
recognize as fourth graders up in the uh
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:03.229 --> 02:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
gallery what we normally do in uh when
 
02:01:06.510 --> 02:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
we're having a what we're in session the
 
02:01:11.229 --> 02:01:11.239 align:start position:0%
representatives all rise and give you an
 
02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:16.550 align:start position:0%

then as you can we only got a few left I
 
02:02:00.709 --> 02:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
was shuffling them I could see somebody
 
02:02:03.669 --> 02:02:03.679 align:start position:0%
like look at he shuffling yes because
 
02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
just take them as they
 
02:02:13.950 --> 02:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
McIntyre um good morning my name is

02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
bass fishing is really good outside my
 
02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
house and we share the water right so I
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
usually ask the folks who are fishing
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
how are they biting as I'm drinking my
 
02:03:04.350 --> 02:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
coffee and my sons actually had their
 
02:03:06.510 --> 02:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
license for boating before they had
 
02:03:10.470 --> 02:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
their license for driving I grew up on
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
the water outside Boston I've taught
 
02:03:15.189 --> 02:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
them water safety and through the use of
 
02:03:17.470 --> 02:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
personal watercrafts far more so than
 
02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
boats I've taught them the lake
 
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
how the markers Works where the rocks
 
02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
are all those stuff and so it's an
 
02:03:26.189 --> 02:03:26.199 align:start position:0%
important part of our education and
 
02:03:29.790 --> 02:03:29.800 align:start position:0%
usage of the lake um and so I'm here to
 
02:03:31.950 --> 02:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
oppose it as a citizen and happy to
 
02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:33.440 align:start position:0%

Ted stachelski I um am from plasto New
 
02:04:06.430 --> 02:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've lived in Rockingham
 
02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
County most of my life outside of
 
02:04:11.069 --> 02:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
serving in the Marine Corps and for the
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh the United States and the state um I
 
02:04:16.270 --> 02:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
want to give you um you may have seen me
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
speak on safety issues uh my back ground
 
02:04:20.510 --> 02:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
not only in veterans issues and
 
02:04:23.229 --> 02:04:23.239 align:start position:0%
Engineering is also about public safety
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the Brain Injury Association Lobby
 
02:04:27.589 --> 02:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
um so not only I'm always looking at
 
02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
safety not only for kids and sports
 
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
concussions um but and Veterans issues
 
02:04:34.990 --> 02:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
with safe equipment but also like with
 
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
um everything's always modernizing and
 
02:04:38.750 --> 02:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
getting better and faster and stronger
 
02:04:41.470 --> 02:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of safety um so like you
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
may have seen things come across your
 
02:04:46.270 --> 02:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
desk about these new o ohvs where they
 
02:04:48.350 --> 02:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
you know they have no car seats so
 
02:04:49.870 --> 02:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
that's my background where I'm coming
 
02:04:51.589 --> 02:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
from and also through the legislative
 
02:04:54.030 --> 02:04:54.040 align:start position:0%

here talking about now jobs jobs tourism
 
02:06:56.669 --> 02:06:56.679 align:start position:0%
engineering Ingenuity in continuing that
 
02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
going and when I read this bill and it
 
02:07:00.510 --> 02:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
was given to me last night by a friend
 
02:07:03.310 --> 02:07:03.320 align:start position:0%
who used to be an um a machinist for
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
land and sea and let me talk about that
 
02:07:07.390 --> 02:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
too land and SE Bob berson actually when
 
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
he prior to he died he built his
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
Flagship building right manufacturing
 
02:07:14.549 --> 02:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
facility an engineering facility right
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
here in in conquered New Hampshire so
 
02:07:19.030 --> 02:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking more about you you know we
 
02:07:20.870 --> 02:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
might talk about
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
pwc's but Bob berson when I'm 15 years
 
02:07:26.589 --> 02:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
old I'm cranking on a two-stroke engine
 
02:07:29.950 --> 02:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
in his shop at the age of 15 years old
 
02:07:32.669 --> 02:07:32.679 align:start position:0%
that grows with you and I've been able
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
to and um train people and meet people
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%
all across the world and all across
 
02:07:40.990 --> 02:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
Motorsports um and support my family as
 
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
they have been able to support their
 
02:07:44.030 --> 02:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
families here in the state of New
 
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it makes us who we are Granite
 
02:07:48.990 --> 02:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
Staters we're leaders in industry we
 
02:07:51.790 --> 02:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
will find a way to make things better
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
and brighter and faster and in fact in
 
02:07:56.270 --> 02:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
the end Bob berson took his little
 
02:07:58.549 --> 02:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
working on jet ski engines and he was
 
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
actually working on engine dynamometers
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
for Abrams Tanks which are now in the
 
02:08:06.510 --> 02:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
war in Ukraine this is huge this so I
 
02:08:08.229 --> 02:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
want you to look at it on the through
 
02:08:11.470 --> 02:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
the lens of of National Security you can
 
02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
look at it as engineering you could look
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
at it as tax dollars and I'm going to
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
end that right there what I'm talking
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
about as tax dollars from being a little
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
kid growing up in Arlington Pond there's
 
02:08:23.549 --> 02:08:23.559 align:start position:0%
always a bad egg or more that's zipping
 
02:08:25.790 --> 02:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
around a pond or a lake and I think
 
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about here you
 
02:08:29.589 --> 02:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
got people who are really upset and I
 
02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
was as a kid and then as an adult living
 
02:08:34.669 --> 02:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
on angle Pond and have actually last
 
02:08:37.709 --> 02:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
year having a seasonal RV uh and Big
 
02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
Island Pond you see a mom with the kids
 
02:08:43.069 --> 02:08:43.079 align:start position:0%
in the couch being pulled by a PWC and
 
02:08:44.189 --> 02:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
there's three little kids and there's
 
02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
only one Spotter and people are on the
 
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
shore going don't do it don't do it
 
02:08:50.549 --> 02:08:50.559 align:start position:0%
against the law she thumbs the nose at
 
02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
everybody go excuse me I'm sorry uh
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
could you focus on the
 
02:08:58.669 --> 02:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
bill right well okay so my point is is
 
02:09:01.870 --> 02:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
that we as taxpayers pay tax money the
 
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
legislator takes the that money and the
 
02:09:07.149 --> 02:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
governor they give it to the Department
 
02:09:10.149 --> 02:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
of Safety and they're not there or if
 
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
they are there voters over on especially
 
02:09:16.030 --> 02:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
on pwc's and these people come back to
 
02:09:17.229 --> 02:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
the shore and they're like yeah I got
 
02:09:20.510 --> 02:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
pulled over with a warning I think we
 
02:09:23.470 --> 02:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
don't have a PWC problem we have a
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
police patrolling problem that needs to
 
02:09:28.430 --> 02:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
be addressed with ever increasing tax
 
02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
dollars as homeowners that we give the
 
02:09:34.030 --> 02:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
government so don't kill jobs don't kill
 
02:09:37.510 --> 02:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
engineer Ingenuity don't kill our
 
02:09:39.990 --> 02:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that we have and be World
 
02:09:42.310 --> 02:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
in World leading leaders in
 
02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturing we need to talk to our
 
02:09:48.030 --> 02:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
governor and legislators about how we
 
02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
can get the police who have the power we
 
02:09:53.390 --> 02:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
can't police our own Bad Eggs we need
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
the police to actually when they pull
 
02:09:57.350 --> 02:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
somebody over on a on a lake or a pond
 
02:09:59.589 --> 02:09:59.599 align:start position:0%
to actually throw the book at them and
 
02:10:01.629 --> 02:10:01.639 align:start position:0%
set an example instead of letting them
 
02:10:04.669 --> 02:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
walk so that's my story and all this I
 
02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
greatly oppose this bill and if you're
 
02:10:09.229 --> 02:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
going to deal with pwc's don't just take
 
02:10:11.069 --> 02:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
it and lump it into what used to be a
 
02:10:13.510 --> 02:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
jet ski because it's not we've come way
 
02:10:16.350 --> 02:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
too far advanced in technology make your
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
own set of laws or just leave it alone
 
02:10:20.830 --> 02:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
like boat I greatly appreciate your time
 
02:10:22.990 --> 02:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions by
 
02:10:24.510 --> 02:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
02:10:28.669 --> 02:10:28.679 align:start position:0%

02:10:33.790 --> 02:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
Alex hi thank you uh my name is Ed loes
 
02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for talking to me I've been
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
voting for 45 years I'm an avid
 
02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
Outdoorsman fisherman Hunter I expect I
 
02:10:48.069 --> 02:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
like the environment like everybody else
 
02:10:51.030 --> 02:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
um um it's it's not a jet ski I've had
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
jet skis in the early 80s I hate them um
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
as far as safety and water skiing and
 
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
tubing there's no comparison as far as
 
02:11:02.589 --> 02:11:02.599 align:start position:0%
safety between tubing and jet skiing
 
02:11:04.390 --> 02:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
behind a jet ski and a boat which we
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
have both jet ski or the P PWC is much
 
02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
safer a line of visib visibility is
 
02:11:14.669 --> 02:11:14.679 align:start position:0%
better there's no prop um it's just a
 
02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:17.079 align:start position:0%
safer vehicle as far as erosion if you
 
02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
look at a boat in a jet
 
02:11:20.910 --> 02:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
it's there's no comparison to the wake
 
02:11:23.950 --> 02:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
it's not even close um economically
 
02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
obviously I think this is going to be a
 
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
disaster for New Hampshire so thank you
 
02:11:32.189 --> 02:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions for
 
02:11:34.549 --> 02:11:34.559 align:start position:0%

02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%

Hampshire I'd like to thank you for
 
02:11:52.549 --> 02:11:52.559 align:start position:0%
allowing me time today to talk to you
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
about why I oppose House Bill
 
02:11:56.790 --> 02:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
1562 I have been a resident of New
 
02:11:58.470 --> 02:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for four years and I've grown
 
02:11:59.910 --> 02:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
up coming to New Hampshire at a year
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
round family Lakehouse I currently live
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
on Lake winaki during the pandemic I
 
02:12:06.750 --> 02:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
moved to the lak house full-time and I
 
02:12:08.950 --> 02:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
love being one with nature I have a boat
 
02:12:10.470 --> 02:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
that I purchased and a couple of seos
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
that I purchased from the Silva
 
02:12:13.629 --> 02:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
Motorsports in molteno my boat is
 
02:12:15.709 --> 02:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
beautiful but it is 26 ft and I'm not
 
02:12:17.069 --> 02:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
comfortable taking the boat out by
 
02:12:19.350 --> 02:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
myself to expl floor but I will take the
 
02:12:21.390 --> 02:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
C out by myself when my boyfriend is not
 
02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
around New Hampshire's motto is Live
 
02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
Free or Die I will lose some of my
 
02:12:28.270 --> 02:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
freedom if House Bill 1562 is passed I
 
02:12:31.229 --> 02:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
just spent over $30,000 on SEO wake Pros
 
02:12:32.709 --> 02:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
for the enjoyment to being able to go
 
02:12:34.870 --> 02:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
out with multiple people that I won't
 
02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
fully be able to use if House Bill 1562
 
02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
is passed one area that I won't be able
 
02:12:41.830 --> 02:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
to visit is greens Basin which is a
 
02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
three minute seu ride from my Dock and
 
02:12:45.669 --> 02:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
where one of my best friends lives I do
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
ride over there frequently to visit my
 
02:12:49.390 --> 02:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
friend and will now need to drive over
 
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
which defeats the purpose of living on
 
02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
the lake unless my boyfriend is
 
02:12:54.669 --> 02:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
available to take me on the boat I will
 
02:12:56.189 --> 02:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
also not be able to se you over to
 
02:12:57.750 --> 02:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
Winter Harbor which is an area that I go
 
02:12:59.430 --> 02:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
to with my friends to enjoy the calmness
 
02:13:01.390 --> 02:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
of the lake and time
 
02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
away I used to take my nieces out in the
 
02:13:05.709 --> 02:13:05.719 align:start position:0%
seedu tubing as it is much easier for me
 
02:13:07.310 --> 02:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
to tube with them than it is to take the
 
02:13:08.910 --> 02:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
boat out something that they gratefully
 
02:13:10.870 --> 02:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
enjoy I am afraid that others will not
 
02:13:12.430 --> 02:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
be able to have the same experience with
 
02:13:14.229 --> 02:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
their children and young kids to get
 
02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
them to enjoy the boat in the
 
02:13:18.629 --> 02:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
lake I couldn't wait to turn 16 to be
 
02:13:20.229 --> 02:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
able to drive the jet skis as my parents
 
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
would allow that over driving the boat
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
it was something we all look forward to
 
02:13:25.149 --> 02:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
in fact I was more excited to drive the
 
02:13:27.189 --> 02:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
jet skis and get my license which did
 
02:13:29.069 --> 02:13:29.079 align:start position:0%
take me a little bit of time it was how
 
02:13:30.669 --> 02:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
I was able to get to friends houses and
 
02:13:32.589 --> 02:13:32.599 align:start position:0%
enjoy the water I watch my niece do the
 
02:13:34.189 --> 02:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
same as she is counting down the days to
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
drive the jet ski between my house and
 
02:13:38.549 --> 02:13:38.559 align:start position:0%
my parents who also live on the water
 
02:13:40.189 --> 02:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
personal watercrafts allow for the ease
 
02:13:41.709 --> 02:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
of exploring the lake and getting used
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
to your surroundings and navigation they
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
allow a quick dip in the lake or a
 
02:13:47.549 --> 02:13:47.559 align:start position:0%
Sunset Cruise I frequently take mine out
 
02:13:48.750 --> 02:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
after work work for someone who works
 
02:13:50.069 --> 02:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
from home it is nice to get out and
 
02:13:51.549 --> 02:13:51.559 align:start position:0%
enjoy a ride at the peaceful end of the
 
02:13:53.589 --> 02:13:53.599 align:start position:0%
day in addition they allow a budget
 
02:13:55.229 --> 02:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
friendly way for families to explore the
 
02:13:57.109 --> 02:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
lake if you are not directly on the
 
02:13:58.830 --> 02:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
water you can easily trailer them place
 
02:14:00.589 --> 02:14:00.599 align:start position:0%
to place and enjoy time with your family
 
02:14:02.510 --> 02:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
on the water they also don't take up as
 
02:14:04.149 --> 02:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
much space in terms of dock space for
 
02:14:05.629 --> 02:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
those that do live on the water and want
 
02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
the availability to have those I am in
 
02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
fear of losing additional Liberties and
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
freedom if House Bill 1562 is passed
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
what's next will you ban me from having
 
02:14:16.229 --> 02:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
a personal watercraft on my dock
 
02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
everything else that I could have
 
02:14:18.510 --> 02:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
discussed today has already been
 
02:14:20.589 --> 02:14:20.599 align:start position:0%
addressed I thank you for your time and
 
02:14:22.189 --> 02:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
I would kindly ask that you reject House
 
02:14:25.149 --> 02:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
Bill 1562 I'd also like to suggest that
 
02:14:26.830 --> 02:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
there is a mass email to sign up for
 
02:14:28.189 --> 02:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
important information that is
 
02:14:29.470 --> 02:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
distributed to all of those who have
 
02:14:31.109 --> 02:14:31.119 align:start position:0%
registered personal watercraft so they
 
02:14:32.950 --> 02:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
are aware of the impact their decisions
 
02:14:34.270 --> 02:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
have on them I do not believe that
 
02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
everyone in this room are the only
 
02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
people that this will affect thank you
 
02:14:41.470 --> 02:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any
 
02:14:44.270 --> 02:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
questions members of the committee
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very
 
02:14:50.350 --> 02:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
much James

02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
Hamstead still morning good morning Mr
 
02:15:05.910 --> 02:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
chair and the members of the committee
 
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
my name is Jim
 
02:15:10.030 --> 02:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
Dennison I moved to New Hampshire 33
 
02:15:13.510 --> 02:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
years ago and have lived on Big Island
 
02:15:16.510 --> 02:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
Pond in Hamstead for the last seven or
 
02:15:19.950 --> 02:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
eight years where we built a house in
 
02:15:23.950 --> 02:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
2015 Big Island Pond it's Lake of 500
 
02:15:27.390 --> 02:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
acres in Hamstead Dairy and Salem it's
 
02:15:29.589 --> 02:15:29.599 align:start position:0%
one of those Lakes where ski craft are
 
02:15:29.599 --> 02:15:30.950 align:start position:0%
one of those Lakes where ski craft are
currently

02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:15:33.629 --> 02:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
banned so therefore I'm here to strongly
 
02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
opposed house built
 
02:15:38.750 --> 02:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
1562 you know I do care deeply about the
 
02:15:40.709 --> 02:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
environmental values of Big Island Pond
 
02:15:43.549 --> 02:15:43.559 align:start position:0%
and all of our New Hampshire Waters I
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
also own and enjoy using a personal
 
02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:48.589 align:start position:0%
also own and enjoy using a personal
watercraft

02:15:48.589 --> 02:15:48.599 align:start position:0%
watercraft
 
02:15:51.189 --> 02:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
I know there are property owners who are
 
02:15:53.990 --> 02:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
strongly opposed to personal watercraft
 
02:15:56.350 --> 02:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
mostly because they're annoyed by them
 
02:15:57.669 --> 02:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
and they would like to see only
 
02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
non-motorized Craft on the waters but a
 
02:16:03.629 --> 02:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
guy like me I'll be 70 in a few
 
02:16:07.390 --> 02:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
days so each year as we get older the
 
02:16:09.629 --> 02:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
physical limitations of using a kayak or
 
02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
a canoe make it tougher and less safe to
 
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
use those those
 
02:16:18.510 --> 02:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
boats so at 70 the personal watercraft
 
02:16:21.310 --> 02:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
is a GameChanger it allows me to get out
 
02:16:23.790 --> 02:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
and have safe and fun
 
02:16:27.350 --> 02:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
access on the lake and banning this
 
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft would severely
 
02:16:31.390 --> 02:16:31.400 align:start position:0%
restrict my access to the Waters of Big
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
Island Pond and completely exclude many
 
02:16:37.150 --> 02:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
others New Hampshire should not be
 
02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
restricting access to personal
 
02:16:40.750 --> 02:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
watercraft I think we should be
 
02:16:43.750 --> 02:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
promoting access to our
 
02:16:46.389 --> 02:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
Lakes so I just want to thank you and
 
02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
respectfully request request that this
 
02:16:51.830 --> 02:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
committee vote to kill this Bill thank
 
02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
you any questions by members of the
 
02:16:59.589 --> 02:16:59.599 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:10.669 --> 02:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
Murphy going once going
 
02:17:14.709 --> 02:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:14.719 --> 02:17:16.589 align:start position:0%
 
Murphy

02:17:16.589 --> 02:17:16.599 align:start position:0%
Murphy
 
02:17:19.990 --> 02:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
finally sorry to it's tough to be the
 
02:17:23.910 --> 02:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:26.349 --> 02:17:26.359 align:start position:0%
Street my apologies but somebody got to
 
02:17:28.190 --> 02:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
be the last and I was shuffling them
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
here they saw me it's a privilege to
 
02:17:32.589 --> 02:17:32.599 align:start position:0%
speak thank you very much um my name is
 
02:17:34.110 --> 02:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
Steve Street I live in molbo New
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't believe I'll use the
 
02:17:37.230 --> 02:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
full three minutes and I don't believe
 
02:17:38.709 --> 02:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
I'm being redundant but thank you for
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
your service to the state and caring
 
02:17:42.110 --> 02:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
about our Lakes um I've had the
 
02:17:43.429 --> 02:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
privilege of enjoying New Hampshire's
 
02:17:45.669 --> 02:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
lak since childhood when my mom and
 
02:17:47.389 --> 02:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
family would take me here to the lakes
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
for region to boating on wiip
 
02:17:51.669 --> 02:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
during my Plymouth State College Years
 
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
and 2016 I was fortunate enough to buy a
 
02:17:56.190 --> 02:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
waterfront home on wiip deepening
 
02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
my commitment to the preservation and
 
02:17:59.870 --> 02:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
safety of these Waters I do care about
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
these Waters living full-time in small
 
02:18:04.349 --> 02:18:04.359 align:start position:0%
Winn pasak Cove we witness the
 
02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
activities of pwc's jet skis wake surf
 
02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
traditional boats every single boating
 
02:18:11.669 --> 02:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
season day despite frequent traffic from
 
02:18:13.429 --> 02:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
all watercraft types and the result in
 
02:18:15.669 --> 02:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
waves we've observed no shoreline
 
02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
erosion or damage to the Natural
 
02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:18.150 align:start position:0%
erosion or damage to the Natural
landscape

02:18:18.150 --> 02:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
landscape
 
02:18:20.030 --> 02:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
I've never once seen one tree in the
 
02:18:22.110 --> 02:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
nearly 3,000 ft of wooded conservation
 
02:18:24.549 --> 02:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
tree line across our Cove fall into the
 
02:18:26.669 --> 02:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
water should I ever see evidence of
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
Sherine erosion I will Advocate to
 
02:18:32.309 --> 02:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
mitigate it the challenges we face on
 
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
these waters are not due to the
 
02:18:36.190 --> 02:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
watercraft themselves but stem from the
 
02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
lack of adherence to existing
 
02:18:40.589 --> 02:18:40.599 align:start position:0%
regulations every watercraft entering or
 
02:18:42.589 --> 02:18:42.599 align:start position:0%
leaving our Cove creates a three to four
 
02:18:45.709 --> 02:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
times wake the size of a PWC wake as
 
02:18:47.669 --> 02:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
they come on or off plane get getting
 
02:18:49.790 --> 02:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
into our small Cove through a noake
 
02:18:52.150 --> 02:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
channel every boting seasoning every
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
boting seizing day we witness the
 
02:18:57.709 --> 02:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
existing 15ot rule get violated right in
 
02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
front of our house uh making this
 
02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill and making it more
 
02:19:05.910 --> 02:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
complex by adding different distances to
 
02:19:09.509 --> 02:19:09.519 align:start position:0%
different watercraft will change nothing
 
02:19:11.469 --> 02:19:11.479 align:start position:0%
the issue lies not with the Marine
 
02:19:13.709 --> 02:19:13.719 align:start position:0%
Patrol whose efforts are commendable
 
02:19:16.389 --> 02:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
given their resources but with the need
 
02:19:18.469 --> 02:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
for more resources boting education
 
02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
rather than additional regulations and
 
02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of questions around
 
02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
education and who's doing what I'd like
 
02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
to answer that even though I wasn't
 
02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
asked that question the greatest
 
02:19:29.790 --> 02:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
education I got from voting on wiip
 
02:19:32.709 --> 02:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
came through great voters that that I
 
02:19:34.190 --> 02:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
had the privilege of teaching me how to
 
02:19:36.790 --> 02:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
boat but through the state programs when
 
02:19:38.669 --> 02:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
I had to become certified that taught me
 
02:19:40.990 --> 02:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
about the laws and how to operate on
 
02:19:42.669 --> 02:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
this I have a great dealer in molten
 
02:19:44.509 --> 02:19:44.519 align:start position:0%
Boro they've done a lot to help me
 
02:19:46.270 --> 02:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
understand how to be a good Boer But
 
02:19:47.910 --> 02:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately we have a program program in
 
02:19:50.270 --> 02:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
place that teaches our captains how to
 
02:19:52.510 --> 02:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
boat safely on this water I'm not a
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
training expert but if we're going to
 
02:19:55.630 --> 02:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
educate everybody on how to be a better
 
02:19:57.710 --> 02:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
boater we probably need a significantly
 
02:20:00.309 --> 02:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
larger program to do this I would argue
 
02:20:02.389 --> 02:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
that the best way to do it is to support
 
02:20:05.590 --> 02:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol uh more give them what
 
02:20:07.950 --> 02:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
they need to enforce our existing
 
02:20:10.389 --> 02:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
regulations and it will educate captains
 
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
on how not to violate
 
02:20:15.030 --> 02:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
laws 80 waterfront homes live on our SM
 
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
Co small Cove I estimate 40% % have
 
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
pwc's if this law passes all of these
 
02:20:22.950 --> 02:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
homes will have to abandon their pwc's
 
02:20:25.070 --> 02:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
and as my son pointed out some of these
 
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
folks this may be their only way to
 
02:20:28.590 --> 02:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
enjoy the lake that they live on so you
 
02:20:30.349 --> 02:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
might be removing their ability to go on
 
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
the water at all I have two PWD C's
 
02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
myself and for the past several Summers
 
02:20:36.870 --> 02:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
with great pride I've watched my son's
 
02:20:40.510 --> 02:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
ride a PWC to work at the local marinas
 
02:20:42.270 --> 02:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
if this law existed these memories would
 
02:20:43.870 --> 02:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
not have happened for my wife and I or
 
02:20:46.429 --> 02:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
my sons who love this Lake my son's
 
02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
experience is working at local marinas
 
02:20:50.510 --> 02:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
accessible by pwc's are cherished
 
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
memories that underscore the importance
 
02:20:53.790 --> 02:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
of these waterways to our community's
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
fabric last summer out on the bigger
 
02:20:58.670 --> 02:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
waterways of wiip a 30-year-old on
 
02:21:03.429 --> 02:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
a PWC violated the existing 150 fot Rule
 
02:21:06.389 --> 02:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
and broadsided our boat causing $99,000
 
02:21:08.830 --> 02:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
of damage to my boat luckily no one was
 
02:21:10.590 --> 02:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
seriously injured you would think
 
02:21:12.110 --> 02:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
because of that I would support greater
 
02:21:14.830 --> 02:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
regulation on pwc's but I do not that
 
02:21:17.309 --> 02:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
was a violation of an existing law that
 
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
is unable to be enforced currently I
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
believe that more stringent laws would
 
02:21:22.830 --> 02:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
not have prevented this incident instead
 
02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
we need to support the Marine Patrol
 
02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
more effectively maintain access to more
 
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
affordable recreational opportunities
 
02:21:30.790 --> 02:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire families I I urge you
 
02:21:32.790 --> 02:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
please to consider the implications of
 
02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
further regulations and oppose this bill
 
02:21:36.830 --> 02:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
ensuring our Lakes remain a vibrant
 
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
accessible treasure for all thank you
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%

live in the same Cove these guys live in
 
02:22:30.150 --> 02:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
um my biggest concern after hearing
 
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
everything today sounds a lot like
 
02:22:34.830 --> 02:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
what's going been going on in the North
 
02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
Country this winter we haven't had a lot
 
02:22:39.790 --> 02:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
of snow we've had more snowmobile
 
02:22:41.710 --> 02:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
accidents if we don't have a lot of
 
02:22:43.630 --> 02:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
water we're going to have a lot more
 
02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
pwc's on just the waterways they can go
 
02:22:48.750 --> 02:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
on will have more accidents will have
 
02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
more issues because there'll be more
 
02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
congestion you take away the right for
 
02:22:56.110 --> 02:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
people to use all these bodies of water
 
02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be going to one
 
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
place there's not been a lot of snow all
 
02:23:01.670 --> 02:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
those snowmobiles that have have been
 
02:23:05.030 --> 02:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
out riding all the around the state when
 
02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
in a good winter are now in Pittsburgh
 
02:23:08.710 --> 02:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
or in coldbrook and there's more
 
02:23:11.230 --> 02:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
congestion you take all these pwc's and
 
02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
you stick them on a few small lakes or
 
02:23:14.750 --> 02:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
on the few big lakes that are left to
 
02:23:17.309 --> 02:23:17.319 align:start position:0%
ride on and we'll have more congestion
 
02:23:18.590 --> 02:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's the one thing I hadn't heard
 
02:23:21.309 --> 02:23:21.319 align:start position:0%
today so that's M that's it any
 
02:23:24.110 --> 02:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
questions by members of the
 
02:23:26.389 --> 02:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
committee thank you seeing that be
 
02:23:35.389 --> 02:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:39.190 --> 02:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
card thank you very much it's been I'm
 
02:23:41.269 --> 02:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
going to call the hearing I'm going to
 
02:23:43.710 --> 02:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
adjourn the hearing I appreciate your
 
02:23:47.630 --> 02:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
coming I think uh still this is we don't
 
02:23:51.349 --> 02:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
do this all every day in this size room
 
02:23:54.670 --> 02:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
but we do do it quite a bit so I
 
02:23:57.309 --> 02:23:57.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate your
 
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:16.000 --> 04:07:36.710 align:start position:0%
 
adjourned

04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:36.720 --> 04:07:55.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:59.830 --> 04:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much this is the

yours if I can get the mic low enough
 
04:09:16.510 --> 04:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
for me here thank you thank you for the
 
04:09:18.910 --> 04:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
record I'm representative Linda Tanner
 
04:09:21.030 --> 04:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh I represent Sullivan District 5 the
 
04:09:24.630 --> 04:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
beautiful towns of sopy and Springfield
 
04:09:26.550 --> 04:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm introducing
 
04:09:29.070 --> 04:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
1390 in my district there are 10 lakes
 
04:09:30.910 --> 04:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
and ponds with Lake snipy being the
 
04:09:34.590 --> 04:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
largest lake in area lake snipy is the
 
04:09:36.389 --> 04:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
center feature of our town and its
 
04:09:38.830 --> 04:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
source of its drinking WI water it's an
 
04:09:41.349 --> 04:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
exceptionally Clear Lake and has dodged
 
04:09:43.070 --> 04:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
the bullet of the introduction of many
 
04:09:46.229 --> 04:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
invasive species Lake spip and all the
 
04:09:48.469 --> 04:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
lakes and ponds in my area are the main
 
04:09:51.750 --> 04:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
attractions for tourists home buyers a
 
04:09:54.070 --> 04:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
main source of income of the local
 
04:09:57.630 --> 04:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
economy and an Irreplaceable natural
 
04:10:00.389 --> 04:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
resource in the past few years the
 
04:10:02.910 --> 04:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
comment I've heard consistently from my
 
04:10:05.349 --> 04:10:05.359 align:start position:0%
constituents at Gatherings and meetings
 
04:10:08.070 --> 04:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
is quote can you do something about the
 
04:10:11.590 --> 04:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
Wake boats and wake surfing unquote with
 
04:10:14.389 --> 04:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
our high water issues this past summer
 
04:10:16.550 --> 04:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
those requests and complaints
 
04:10:19.790 --> 04:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
increased the issue most the issues most
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
contentious are sherline erosion damage
 
04:10:25.389 --> 04:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
to Shoreline
 
04:10:28.389 --> 04:10:28.399 align:start position:0%

small recreational craft interference
 
04:10:36.269 --> 04:10:36.279 align:start position:0%
and concerns with sailing
 
04:10:39.149 --> 04:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
riatas and and fear of import of
 
04:10:41.870 --> 04:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
invasive species disturbing the bottom
 
04:10:44.790 --> 04:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
of the lake causing turbidity algae and
 
04:10:47.590 --> 04:10:47.600 align:start position:0%

around the
 
04:10:54.950 --> 04:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
lake wave surfing is an ocean sport
 
04:10:57.910 --> 04:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's been around since boards humans
 
04:11:00.790 --> 04:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
and ocean waves came together on
 
04:11:03.830 --> 04:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
freshwater lakes and inland waterways
 
04:11:05.830 --> 04:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
water sports have largely consisted of
 
04:11:09.149 --> 04:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
sports like water skiing wake boarding
 
04:11:11.510 --> 04:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
tubing and about anything that could be
 
04:11:13.750 --> 04:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
towed behind a power boat once they had
 
04:11:17.309 --> 04:11:17.319 align:start position:0%
power boats towboats depend on Bo boats
 
04:11:19.910 --> 04:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
reaching a speed that both the boat and
 
04:11:22.590 --> 04:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
what's pulled behind can ride on top of
 
04:11:24.870 --> 04:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
the water called
 
04:11:27.510 --> 04:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
hydroplaning these boats create waves
 
04:11:30.389 --> 04:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
typically 3 to 6 Ines
 
04:11:33.269 --> 04:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
High sometime in the late '90s early
 
04:11:36.550 --> 04:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
2000s some enterprising and very clever
 
04:11:38.070 --> 04:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
Engineers start started working on a
 
04:11:40.189 --> 04:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
boat that could produce an ocean type
 
04:11:44.309 --> 04:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
wave on a fresh water lake or a
 
04:11:47.269 --> 04:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
Waterway these ocean-like waves would be
 
04:11:50.710 --> 04:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
larger with more volume and energy so
 
04:11:53.870 --> 04:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
that they could support a person on a
 
04:11:57.349 --> 04:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
surfboard instead of sleek fast towboats
 
04:11:59.389 --> 04:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
which are designed to ride on top of the
 
04:12:02.109 --> 04:12:02.119 align:start position:0%
water these boats have witer bottoms or
 
04:12:05.790 --> 04:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
hulls to displace lots of water they
 
04:12:08.630 --> 04:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
have up to three tanks ballast tanks
 
04:12:11.429 --> 04:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
across the stern that pump water in and
 
04:12:15.269 --> 04:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
out to create up to 5,000 or even more
 
04:12:18.790 --> 04:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
pounds of weight to weigh down the stern
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
which is the back of the boat so the
 
04:12:23.229 --> 04:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
boat won't plane but pushes through the
 
04:12:25.710 --> 04:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
water the engine and propeller are
 
04:12:28.429 --> 04:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
designed for maximum power to be able to
 
04:12:32.189 --> 04:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
push and displace a huge swath of water
 
04:12:35.469 --> 04:12:35.479 align:start position:0%
this displacement of water then rebounds
 
04:12:37.910 --> 04:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
behind the boat to create two and half
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
to 3ft
 
04:12:42.189 --> 04:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
waves that have enough force and volume
 
04:12:44.910 --> 04:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
to support a person on a
 
04:12:47.630 --> 04:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
surfboard on the UND side of the of the
 
04:12:49.950 --> 04:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
newer boats near the back are metal fins
 
04:12:52.309 --> 04:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
that can be adjusted by computer to
 
04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
change these ocean-like waves to fit the
 
04:12:56.349 --> 04:12:56.359 align:start position:0%
surface size and
 
04:12:59.229 --> 04:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
preference we have distributed a graphic
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
which shows the weight boats in wake
 
04:13:03.429 --> 04:13:03.439 align:start position:0%
surfing mode which illustrates the
 
04:13:06.389 --> 04:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of running these
 
04:13:09.630 --> 04:13:09.640 align:start position:0%
boats in two shallow water too close to
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
shorelines and other structures in boats
 
04:13:14.710 --> 04:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
and on lakes and ponds that are too
 
04:13:16.229 --> 04:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
small to support
 
04:13:19.790 --> 04:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
them wake surfing boats are made for fun
 
04:13:21.990 --> 04:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
they're decked out with cool racks neat
 
04:13:24.990 --> 04:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
sound systems computer controls and
 
04:13:26.469 --> 04:13:26.479 align:start position:0%
they're very
 
04:13:29.309 --> 04:13:29.319 align:start position:0%
expensive I've water skied for many
 
04:13:31.349 --> 04:13:31.359 align:start position:0%
years and taught water skiing so I
 
04:13:33.750 --> 04:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
imagine that it's fun and challenged to
 
04:13:37.229 --> 04:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
Surf behind on these waves and this bill
 
04:13:41.309 --> 04:13:41.319 align:start position:0%
is not intended to ban wake
 
04:13:44.229 --> 04:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
surfing in New Hampshire all natural
 
04:13:46.109 --> 04:13:46.119 align:start position:0%
bodies of fresh water are held in the
 
04:13:49.990 --> 04:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
public trust and allowed reasonable use
 
04:13:52.389 --> 04:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
regulations and rules allow for safe
 
04:13:55.229 --> 04:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
shared use of our water to help prevent
 
04:13:57.990 --> 04:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
damage to property and wildlife habitat
 
04:14:00.229 --> 04:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
and to help maintain the water
 
04:14:02.710 --> 04:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
quality if the shoreline and the quality
 
04:14:05.389 --> 04:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
of the lakes and ponds degrade we will
 
04:14:08.109 --> 04:14:08.119 align:start position:0%
lose our tourists proper values will go
 
04:14:13.070 --> 04:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
down our economy will suffer licensing
 
04:14:16.469 --> 04:14:16.479 align:start position:0%
registration Boer safety education are
 
04:14:18.630 --> 04:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
important but have not addressed the
 
04:14:21.670 --> 04:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
major issues with wake boats we need to
 
04:14:23.710 --> 04:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
act in the form of regulations and guard

that have been enacted in other states

quality others more export than I can
 
04:17:46.109 --> 04:17:46.119 align:start position:0%
speak to the science of the impact of
 
04:17:49.109 --> 04:17:49.119 align:start position:0%
wake surf boating my wake surfing
 
04:17:51.510 --> 04:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
experience however confirms that the
 
04:17:54.189 --> 04:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
power of wake surf waves and of the
 
04:17:56.510 --> 04:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
turbulence produced in the water column
 
04:17:58.790 --> 04:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
requires a sort of protections crafted
 
04:18:00.149 --> 04:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
in HB
 
04:18:04.149 --> 04:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
1390 I strongly support this bill that
 
04:18:07.870 --> 04:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
said let me add two uh thoughts for your
 
04:18:11.189 --> 04:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
further consideration first moing Fields
 
04:18:13.790 --> 04:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
extend as much as 200 feet into Newfound
 
04:18:17.030 --> 04:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
Lake from the shorefront kayakers paddle
 
04:18:18.750 --> 04:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
boarders swimmers and swim platform
 
04:18:20.670 --> 04:18:20.680 align:start position:0%
users including my own young
 
04:18:23.269 --> 04:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
grandchildren enjoy Newfound Lake up to
 
04:18:25.550 --> 04:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
100 feet or more from the
 
04:18:27.990 --> 04:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
shoreline shouldn't they be afforded the
 
04:18:30.790 --> 04:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
same protections from the power of wake
 
04:18:33.269 --> 04:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
surf waves equivalent to those provided
 
04:18:37.389 --> 04:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
by HB 1390 for the shorefront
 
04:18:39.070 --> 04:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
second the interaction between the
 
04:18:41.469 --> 04:18:41.479 align:start position:0%
proposed contiguous area and the
 
04:18:43.990 --> 04:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
shoreline distance requirements of HP
 
04:18:46.710 --> 04:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
1390 should be considered in narrower
 
04:18:49.670 --> 04:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
bays and channels for
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
example the Bay north of Wellington
 
04:18:54.229 --> 04:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
State Park on newfound lake is large
 
04:18:56.910 --> 04:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
enough and deep enough to meet both Bill
 
04:18:59.189 --> 04:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
requirements yet wake surfing in that
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
bay and the turns required to wake surf
 
04:19:05.429 --> 04:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
there would produce waves that would I
 
04:19:08.109 --> 04:19:08.119 align:start position:0%
believe make the Bay virtually unusable
 
04:19:10.630 --> 04:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
for kayakers paddle boarders and even
 
04:19:10.640 --> 04:19:11.550 align:start position:0%
for kayakers paddle boarders and even
other

04:19:11.550 --> 04:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:19:14.590 --> 04:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
watercraft I know I've wake surfed there
 
04:19:16.630 --> 04:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
and concluded that it was unfair of me
 
04:19:21.030 --> 04:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
to monopolize the Bay now I exclusively
 
04:19:23.910 --> 04:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
wake surf in the largest most open parts
 
04:19:25.109 --> 04:19:25.119 align:start position:0%
of Newfound
 
04:19:28.229 --> 04:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
Lake wake surfing is a wonderful sport
 
04:19:30.670 --> 04:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
candidly it's a part of the bribery that
 
04:19:33.349 --> 04:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
gets my family and my grandchildren to
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
visit us on
 
04:19:36.670 --> 04:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
newfound however the recreational benef
 
04:19:38.670 --> 04:19:38.680 align:start position:0%
benefits of wake surfing must be
 
04:19:41.349 --> 04:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
balanced appropriately against the
 
04:19:43.630 --> 04:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
interests of other water sports and of
 
04:19:45.790 --> 04:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
the immediate and long-term health of
 
04:19:49.710 --> 04:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's lakes and shorefront HB
 
04:19:52.910 --> 04:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
1390 is an essential is an essential
 
04:19:56.030 --> 04:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
step in securing that balance in my view
 
04:19:57.710 --> 04:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
04:19:57.720 --> 04:19:58.670 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions
thank

04:20:14.429 --> 04:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
for thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:20:18.030 --> 04:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question as a member of um the
 
04:20:20.870 --> 04:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
Newfound Lake uh and water sorry new
 
04:20:22.910 --> 04:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
found Lake Association region
 
04:20:25.790 --> 04:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
Association sorry can you describe some
 
04:20:27.070 --> 04:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
of the impacts that you've seen
 
04:20:29.790 --> 04:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
firsthand from uh wake surfing either
 
04:20:33.750 --> 04:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
due to erosion or um Wildlife impact or
 
04:20:34.870 --> 04:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
things like
 
04:20:38.389 --> 04:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
that uh I can speak to just two elements
 
04:20:43.469 --> 04:20:43.479 align:start position:0%
of it uh one is uh the um I benefit in
 
04:20:45.389 --> 04:20:45.399 align:start position:0%
in at my location I benefit from the
 
04:20:47.870 --> 04:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
fact that the the the channel is fairly
 
04:20:50.750 --> 04:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
low as we live on the West Shore near
 
04:20:52.950 --> 04:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
mayew Island so there's not much wake
 
04:20:56.790 --> 04:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
surfing near us but the the size of the
 
04:20:59.349 --> 04:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
Wake that is produced if one is near the
 
04:21:02.950 --> 04:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
shore is certain to erode the shoreline
 
04:21:04.950 --> 04:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
and I have seen the effects of that as
 
04:21:06.670 --> 04:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
regards the wildlife I can't speak speak
 
04:21:09.510 --> 04:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
to that um I suppose I would be most
 
04:21:12.109 --> 04:21:12.119 align:start position:0%
concerned about Lon habitat but I'm not
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
sure uh in uh shallow areas uh it's it's
 
04:21:18.790 --> 04:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
quite visible that there is a sediment
 
04:21:21.870 --> 04:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
impact uh uh from the turbulence created
 
04:21:26.950 --> 04:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:31.389 --> 04:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
col and no any other additional
 
04:21:33.910 --> 04:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
much thank you Mr
 
04:21:35.439 --> 04:21:38.469 align:start position:0%

04:21:40.750 --> 04:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
what I try to do because I've got people
 
04:21:42.309 --> 04:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
for and people against they got two
 
04:21:44.870 --> 04:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
piles of pink cards I'm going to try to
 
04:21:44.880 --> 04:21:46.750 align:start position:0%
piles of pink cards I'm going to try to
alternate

04:21:46.750 --> 04:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
alternate
 
04:21:50.269 --> 04:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
so that was a that was a for the bill
 
04:21:50.279 --> 04:21:51.189 align:start position:0%
so that was a that was a for the bill
this

04:21:51.189 --> 04:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:21:51.199 --> 04:21:54.349 align:start position:0%

I'm glad they put that one up higher no
 
04:22:17.429 --> 04:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
it's not high enough that might
 
04:22:21.309 --> 04:22:21.319 align:start position:0%
work speak loud yes excuse me good

afternoon Mr chairman and members of the
 
04:22:25.070 --> 04:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
committee my name is John Wall I am the

Marina and the New Hampshire Marine
 
04:22:31.030 --> 04:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
trades president our membership includes
 
04:22:33.910 --> 04:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
20 marinas and hundreds of employees I
 
04:22:34.870 --> 04:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
would like to take this time to
 
04:22:36.590 --> 04:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
recognize our opposition in the audience
 
04:22:39.590 --> 04:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
in the over 1,600 people that voted in
 
04:22:42.670 --> 04:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
testimony online we strongly oppose
 
04:22:45.269 --> 04:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1390 we have passed out
 
04:22:46.910 --> 04:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
packets or are passing out packets to
 
04:22:49.510 --> 04:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
you that will include economic data
 
04:22:51.710 --> 04:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
environmental information maps showing
 
04:22:53.309 --> 04:22:53.319 align:start position:0%
how different lakes will be infected by
 
04:22:55.630 --> 04:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
this bill and also the efforts to our
 
04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
education and
 
04:22:59.229 --> 04:22:59.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement the foundation of our
 
04:23:01.030 --> 04:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
opposition lies in the public trust
 
04:23:04.309 --> 04:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
doctrine that any Lake over 10 acres
 
04:23:06.550 --> 04:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
should be held for the public to be used
 
04:23:09.910 --> 04:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
we support Public Access houseb 1390
 
04:23:11.070 --> 04:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
takes it
 
04:23:13.269 --> 04:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
away this is the fifth year we've
 
04:23:16.070 --> 04:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
debated wake booat or wake surf issues
 
04:23:18.510 --> 04:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
starting in 2019 with the Wake booat
 
04:23:20.910 --> 04:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
commission which I served on at the
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
conclusion of that the New Hampshire
 
04:23:23.910 --> 04:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
Marine Trad Association committed
 
04:23:26.309 --> 04:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
ourselves to do a wake responsibly
 
04:23:28.109 --> 04:23:28.119 align:start position:0%
campaign much like that's done
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
nationally 200 foot setbacks reducing
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
stereo volumes and minimizing repetitive
 
04:23:37.349 --> 04:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
passes but the supporters of Health 1390
 
04:23:38.469 --> 04:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
that wasn't
 
04:23:40.630 --> 04:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
enough they continued to recommend
 
04:23:43.309 --> 04:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
legislation restrictions or bans never
 
04:23:45.070 --> 04:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
coming to the table for conversation or
 
04:23:47.149 --> 04:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
compromise over our last four years of
 
04:23:49.269 --> 04:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
work the New Hampshire Marine trades
 
04:23:51.189 --> 04:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
Association has hosted meetings
 
04:23:53.070 --> 04:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
distributed signage at boat ramps
 
04:23:54.710 --> 04:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
invested tens of thousands of dollars in
 
04:23:57.070 --> 04:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
radio ads pamphlets and boats each
 
04:23:59.109 --> 04:23:59.119 align:start position:0%

boat
 
04:24:06.229 --> 04:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
owners in 2021 we defeat we debated
 
04:24:08.750 --> 04:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 229 to define a wake build
 
04:24:11.950 --> 04:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
that bill did not pass the house in 2022
 
04:24:15.429 --> 04:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
we debated House Bill 1071 to establish
 
04:24:19.030 --> 04:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
a 250t setback which was amended to 500
 
04:24:21.550 --> 04:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
feet after a Minnesota study that bill
 
04:24:24.030 --> 04:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
also did not pass the house we are back
 
04:24:26.469 --> 04:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
today with the bill that both defines a
 
04:24:29.510 --> 04:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
wake booat establishes a 500t setback
 
04:24:33.070 --> 04:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
and an unenforceable 20t recommended
 
04:24:35.109 --> 04:24:35.119 align:start position:0%
depth from our already depleted Marine
 
04:24:37.469 --> 04:24:37.479 align:start position:0%
Patrol this this bill will eliminate
 
04:24:39.630 --> 04:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
access it will create congestion in our
 
04:24:41.590 --> 04:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
already busiest parts of our legs with
 
04:24:43.670 --> 04:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
further unintended consequences due to
 
04:24:47.109 --> 04:24:47.119 align:start position:0%
safety now let's look at house boo 1390
 
04:24:49.429 --> 04:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
it creates definition of a wake booat in
 
04:24:51.590 --> 04:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
your packet you will find multiple
 
04:24:52.750 --> 04:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
different kinds of boats that have
 
04:24:55.030 --> 04:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
ballast systems that create safe
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities for people to wake surf
 
04:24:58.590 --> 04:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
but did you know a sailboat also has
 
04:25:01.070 --> 04:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
ballast is a sailboat now a wake booat
 
04:25:04.510 --> 04:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say it establishes a 500t
 
04:25:06.710 --> 04:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
step back and a 20ft requirement
 
04:25:08.630 --> 04:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
in depth these requirements like I said
 
04:25:11.469 --> 04:25:11.479 align:start position:0%
are unenforcable and to create Maps
 
04:25:13.550 --> 04:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
develop new areas for wake surfing but
 
04:25:15.830 --> 04:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
at what cost and who will pay for this
 
04:25:17.990 --> 04:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
the effective date of this bill is July
 
04:25:20.550 --> 04:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
1st 2024 smack dab in the middle of the
 
04:25:22.109 --> 04:25:22.119 align:start position:0%
summer that will create immense
 
04:25:24.030 --> 04:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
confusion with our public and again
 
04:25:25.710 --> 04:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
challenge our Marine
 
04:25:27.590 --> 04:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
Patrol finally I'd like to talk about
 
04:25:27.600 --> 04:25:28.269 align:start position:0%
Patrol finally I'd like to talk about
the

04:25:28.269 --> 04:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:25:30.149 --> 04:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
environment New Hampshire's boating
 
04:25:32.309 --> 04:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
season is only 2 to 3 months long unlike
 
04:25:34.630 --> 04:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
most other states and our WG surfing
 
04:25:35.750 --> 04:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
typically does not have the kind of
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
impact that mother nature does frequent
 
04:25:41.429 --> 04:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
storms heavy rains High lake levels
 
04:25:44.510 --> 04:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
strong winds and Ice have caused
 
04:25:47.070 --> 04:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
significant damage to our
 
04:25:50.710 --> 04:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
shorelines last Thursday and excuse me
 
04:25:52.510 --> 04:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
last Thursday we taught the Winds of 50
 
04:25:55.670 --> 04:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
mph on Lake a mostly unfrozen Lake
 
04:25:58.269 --> 04:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
currently two to 4ft waves crashed on
 
04:25:59.910 --> 04:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
our shorelines for a stain sustained
 
04:26:03.070 --> 04:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
period of 36 hours and last summer was
 
04:26:04.710 --> 04:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
our wetest summer on record according to
 
04:26:07.030 --> 04:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
the National Oceanic Atmospheric
 
04:26:10.550 --> 04:26:10.560 align:start position:0%

04:26:16.109 --> 04:26:16.119 align:start position:0%
Lake since the 1960s and 70s according
 
04:26:18.630 --> 04:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire Dees long before any
 
04:26:20.790 --> 04:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
wake boat was traveling on this water
 
04:26:22.269 --> 04:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
and also sign of bacteria has been found
 
04:26:25.030 --> 04:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
in lakes that do not have
 
04:26:27.790 --> 04:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
boating most recently a s of bacteria
 
04:26:29.950 --> 04:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
Bloom from Lake kisaka has throwed
 
04:26:32.229 --> 04:26:32.239 align:start position:0%

winaki as late as October long after our
 
04:26:37.630 --> 04:26:37.640 align:start position:0%
boating season is has come to an end a
 
04:26:39.510 --> 04:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
major factor from s bacteria is storm
 
04:26:41.510 --> 04:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
water runoff and there has been no
 
04:26:44.389 --> 04:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
direct correlation from Wake
 
04:26:46.830 --> 04:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
Sports sediment displacement can happen
 
04:26:47.710 --> 04:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
through many different types of
 
04:26:50.030 --> 04:26:50.040 align:start position:0%

contribute lastly I'd like to talk about
 
04:27:05.309 --> 04:27:05.319 align:start position:0%
our Loom population according to
 
04:27:06.870 --> 04:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
articles in interviews the New Hampshire
 
04:27:09.550 --> 04:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
Loom population has grown to 785 birds
 
04:27:13.429 --> 04:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
in 2022 up from only 127 in
 
04:27:15.910 --> 04:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
1993 opponents will say WG serving
 
04:27:18.950 --> 04:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
impacts the birds but Studies have found
 
04:27:21.030 --> 04:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
that the loom population could be 43%
 
04:27:22.710 --> 04:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
higher if it weren't for the leading
 
04:27:26.309 --> 04:27:26.319 align:start position:0%

human development on shorelines those
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
are problems for loons not boats we all
 
04:27:38.229 --> 04:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
care about our environment and our aren
 
04:27:40.269 --> 04:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
is do especially our livelihood depends
 
04:27:42.790 --> 04:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
on it but to pick one type of boat or
 
04:27:44.910 --> 04:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
activity for bands restricts not
 
04:27:47.229 --> 04:27:47.239 align:start position:0%

fishing this morning personal watercraft
 
04:27:51.429 --> 04:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
for the topical conversation and it
 
04:27:52.950 --> 04:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
seems as though the tradition of boating
 
04:27:55.349 --> 04:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
is under attack a passion of hundreds of
 
04:27:56.670 --> 04:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
thousands of New Hampshire residents and

run thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:28:28.030 --> 04:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Mr Wally um
 
04:28:30.349 --> 04:28:30.359 align:start position:0%
earlier in your testimony you said that
 
04:28:32.349 --> 04:28:32.359 align:start position:0%
a sailboat could be considered a weight
 
04:28:36.309 --> 04:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
booat because it has ballasts um I I I'm
 
04:28:38.910 --> 04:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
reading the bill and it says a wake boat
 
04:28:42.149 --> 04:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
means a motorboat so do you consider a
 
04:28:44.990 --> 04:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
sailboat to be a motorboat if it has a
 
04:28:47.950 --> 04:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
motor H if it has a motor and sobs have
 
04:28:50.510 --> 04:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
Motors okay and then
 
04:28:53.269 --> 04:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
follow follow up thank you and then you
 
04:28:56.830 --> 04:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
also mentioned Lake kisaka and that um
 
04:28:59.590 --> 04:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
the major reason for their cyanobacteria
 
04:29:02.750 --> 04:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
blooms was runoff are you aware of their
 
04:29:04.790 --> 04:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
that in their watershed management plan
 
04:29:06.590 --> 04:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
which was prepared by environmental
 
04:29:09.030 --> 04:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
Engineers that it stated that the the
 
04:29:11.189 --> 04:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
root cause of their blooms is from
 
04:29:13.389 --> 04:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
sediment I meant to speak if there was
 
04:29:16.349 --> 04:29:16.359 align:start position:0%
Mr I apologize that lake kosaka has a c
 
04:29:18.389 --> 04:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
bacteria Bloom and it flows through a
 
04:29:21.309 --> 04:29:21.319 align:start position:0%
river and cob bacteria as a whole is
 
04:29:23.309 --> 04:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
from runoff not specifically kandaka so
 
04:29:29.229 --> 04:29:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:29.239 --> 04:29:32.269 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:29:32.269 --> 04:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:38.030 --> 04:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:39.670 --> 04:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:29:43.309 --> 04:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question um we've been
 
04:29:47.070 --> 04:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
bombarded with all kinds of reports
 
04:29:49.349 --> 04:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
Thank God I'm a tree farmer and I'm
 
04:29:52.630 --> 04:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
happy to see the timber being cut thank
 
04:29:56.870 --> 04:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
you um I have two questions sure in
 
04:29:59.389 --> 04:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
talking with the members of the
 
04:30:02.189 --> 04:30:02.199 align:start position:0%
committee and the sponsor do you think
 
04:30:04.149 --> 04:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
there's any room for
 
04:30:08.229 --> 04:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
compromise on what they have I will say
 
04:30:10.910 --> 04:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
that we've compromised Now 50 additional
 
04:30:13.149 --> 04:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
feet which is approximately 25% above
 
04:30:16.189 --> 04:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
safe passage I can't speak to the
 
04:30:18.309 --> 04:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
support um I've heard different things
 
04:30:19.550 --> 04:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
that I'll leave out of this conversation
 
04:30:21.710 --> 04:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
at the moment um because I I can't speak
 
04:30:23.349 --> 04:30:23.359 align:start position:0%
for them sorry I don't I have heard that
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
there has been some conversation about
 
04:30:27.030 --> 04:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
that but I think more conversation needs
 
04:30:28.510 --> 04:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
to be had but the New Hampshire Marine
 
04:30:31.229 --> 04:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
TRS Association has included incate Bill
 
04:30:34.830 --> 04:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
431 an additional 50 ft for 200t setback
 
04:30:37.269 --> 04:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
so we are compromise
 
04:30:40.670 --> 04:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
in do you have a
 
04:30:43.590 --> 04:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
followup can can you get closer to the
 
04:30:45.189 --> 04:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
mic and repeat your question I know
 
04:30:47.189 --> 04:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
you're tall and maybe you can just pick
 
04:30:49.830 --> 04:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
the whole thing right up how's that
 
04:30:53.070 --> 04:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
that's better that's
 
04:30:56.070 --> 04:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
great can you repeat your your response
 
04:30:57.590 --> 04:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
sure I'll say the New Hampshire Marine
 
04:30:59.030 --> 04:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
trades Association is working with
 
04:31:01.670 --> 04:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 431 we're adding 50 feet
 
04:31:04.070 --> 04:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
over safe passage so we feel that is an
 
04:31:06.030 --> 04:31:06.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate compromise for now I can't
 
04:31:07.550 --> 04:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
speak for the supporters and how they
 
04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
feel about compromise um but I'm sure
 
04:31:11.790 --> 04:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
conversations can be had but at the
 
04:31:14.109 --> 04:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
present moment we feel we are
 
04:31:18.109 --> 04:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:23.910 --> 04:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
up all right what follow Sor this is the
 
04:31:26.750 --> 04:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
third BL okay okay I'll ask somebody
 
04:31:30.790 --> 04:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
else a question okay well I'll yeah I'll
 
04:31:33.030 --> 04:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
be back to you repes representative
 
04:31:35.189 --> 04:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:31:37.309 --> 04:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
taking my my question you mentioned the
 
04:31:40.830 --> 04:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
4 foot uh waves on Lake wiam Baki the
 
04:31:42.990 --> 04:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
vast majority of New Hampshire Lakes are
 
04:31:45.750 --> 04:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
under a th000 Acres um are you aware of
 
04:31:50.630 --> 04:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
four 4ot natural waves on an a th acre
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
Lake I can't speak the four feet but I
 
04:31:54.229 --> 04:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
can tell you that I have the Good
 
04:31:55.630 --> 04:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
Fortune I travel around the state
 
04:31:58.349 --> 04:31:58.359 align:start position:0%
delivering boats to customers homes and
 
04:32:00.750 --> 04:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
I've seen lakes that are glassy calm one
 
04:32:05.510 --> 04:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
day and quite rough the next day and I
 
04:32:07.229 --> 04:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
can tell you when I see those I stop and
 
04:32:08.910 --> 04:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
look at it I've even taken pictures I
 
04:32:10.990 --> 04:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
figured that question would come up so
 
04:32:12.910 --> 04:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
yes I've seen larger waves I've seen
 
04:32:14.670 --> 04:32:14.680 align:start position:0%
smaller waves I've in gassy conditions
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
but three to four foot waves on a blowy
 
04:32:19.309 --> 04:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
day uh even on Lake kisaka there's a 45
 
04:32:22.149 --> 04:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
M hour wi last year and it was rough
 
04:32:27.309 --> 04:32:27.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:29.870 --> 04:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
sure representative wolf you wish this
 
04:32:32.550 --> 04:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
followup on a
 
04:32:34.429 --> 04:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
04:32:34.439 --> 04:32:36.030 align:start position:0%
question thank
you

04:32:36.030 --> 04:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:32:39.389 --> 04:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure which pile of papers I'm
 
04:32:42.109 --> 04:32:42.119 align:start position:0%
going to believe in but are you willing
 
04:32:45.630 --> 04:32:45.640 align:start position:0%
to take the risk that the Shoreline May
 
04:32:50.109 --> 04:32:50.119 align:start position:0%
erode the bottom may come up and
 
04:32:55.630 --> 04:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
nutrients make the lake unusable in due
 
04:32:58.229 --> 04:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
course I'll make the statement that
 
04:32:59.950 --> 04:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
mother nature makes waves just like
 
04:33:02.309 --> 04:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
boats and she can work a lot harder than
 
04:33:04.189 --> 04:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
a wake boat for a longer duration of
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
time uh anyone can use the lake whether
 
04:33:08.629 --> 04:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
you're going to be put a boat in neutral
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
reverse and shallow water at a dock
 
04:33:11.830 --> 04:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to turn the lake up
 
04:33:13.429 --> 04:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
anything can cause turbidity in this
 
04:33:15.470 --> 04:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
Lake and not specifically wake B so that
 
04:33:17.510 --> 04:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be pinned into a corner as the
 
04:33:23.230 --> 04:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:25.709 --> 04:33:25.719 align:start position:0%
issues any other questions by members of
 
04:33:25.719 --> 04:33:26.590 align:start position:0%
issues any other questions by members of
the

04:33:26.590 --> 04:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:33:28.670 --> 04:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
committee please don't make me turn it
 
04:33:32.629 --> 04:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
around all the time just say
 
04:33:35.629 --> 04:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
yes hearing none thank thank you very
 
04:33:39.390 --> 04:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:44.189 --> 04:33:44.199 align:start position:0%
time represent excuse me Carol R fos
 
04:33:50.590 --> 04:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:53.070 --> 04:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
autobond speak for three
 
04:33:56.150 --> 04:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
minutes good afternoon Mr chair and
 
04:33:57.949 --> 04:33:57.959 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um my name is
 
04:34:00.230 --> 04:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
Carol Foss I'm senior adviser for
 
04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
Science and policy at New Hampshire oton
 
04:34:05.551 --> 04:34:05.561 align:start position:0%
where a Statewide environmental organ
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
ganization dedicated to protecting New
 
04:34:09.830 --> 04:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's environment for wildlife and
 
04:34:13.830 --> 04:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
for people um I had anticipated being
 
04:34:16.830 --> 04:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
rather later in the in the order this
 
04:34:19.629 --> 04:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
afternoon um but I'm will still be brief
 
04:34:21.310 --> 04:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
because I think there are others in the
 
04:34:25.070 --> 04:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
room who can address um some of the
 
04:34:28.269 --> 04:34:28.279 align:start position:0%
details I do have written testimony that
 
04:34:32.029 --> 04:34:32.039 align:start position:0%
I will provide to you um we strongly
 
04:34:37.510 --> 04:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
support this bill um while there are
 
04:34:40.390 --> 04:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
many responsible boter who will
 
04:34:44.510 --> 04:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
voluntarily follow guidelines um the
 
04:34:47.349 --> 04:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
importance of our Lakes to Quality of
 
04:34:51.029 --> 04:34:51.039 align:start position:0%
Life in this state to New Hampshire's
 
04:34:54.830 --> 04:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
economy um both locally and through
 
04:35:00.830 --> 04:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
tourism are too great to risk and a few
 
04:35:05.789 --> 04:35:05.799 align:start position:0%
bad actors can do a lot of damage um
 
04:35:07.990 --> 04:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
we're particularly concerned about
 
04:35:08.000 --> 04:35:09.429 align:start position:0%
we're particularly concerned about
shoreline

04:35:09.429 --> 04:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
shoreline
 
04:35:13.789 --> 04:35:13.799 align:start position:0%
erosion um and about the turbidity issue
 
04:35:19.109 --> 04:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
because that can make it easier for
 
04:35:22.390 --> 04:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
loons and mergansers and Otter and mink
 
04:35:26.869 --> 04:35:26.879 align:start position:0%
and other organisms that feed on fish to
 
04:35:28.670 --> 04:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
see their prey
 
04:35:32.670 --> 04:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
underwater um as well as stirring up
 
04:35:37.029 --> 04:35:37.039 align:start position:0%
nutrients that can um cause algae blooms
 
04:35:40.629 --> 04:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
as well as cyanobacteria blooms um so
 
04:35:42.349 --> 04:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to leave it there and leave
 
04:35:45.269 --> 04:35:45.279 align:start position:0%

my family's been there since the 60s and
 
04:43:21.990 --> 04:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
we've always enjoyed the lake in
 
04:43:25.590 --> 04:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
Recreation but still always taking care
 
04:43:27.788 --> 04:43:27.798 align:start position:0%
of the health of that
 
04:43:32.030 --> 04:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
Lake uh Crystal Lake is about four
 
04:43:34.948 --> 04:43:34.958 align:start position:0%
approximately 400 acres and it has a
 
04:43:38.310 --> 04:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
small area that about 50 ft deep the
 
04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
average uh depth is 20 and I believe
 
04:43:46.110 --> 04:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
it's really critical this bill is really
 
04:43:48.830 --> 04:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
critical to restoring and preserving the
 
04:43:52.430 --> 04:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
health of the lake in all of our Lakes I
 
04:43:57.390 --> 04:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
have uh one example I'd like to share uh
 
04:44:01.750 --> 04:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
as I said we've always tried to uh
 
04:44:03.750 --> 04:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
protect the health of our Lake and one
 
04:44:05.270 --> 04:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the things that we've tried to
 
04:44:08.430 --> 04:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
protect is the shoreline from
 
04:44:11.948 --> 04:44:11.958 align:start position:0%
erosion we've always let the wild Alder
 
04:44:14.830 --> 04:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
grow in on the edge of the lake to
 
04:44:16.830 --> 04:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
protect so that the shoreline wouldn't
 
04:44:20.510 --> 04:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
be eroded and in the last two
 
04:44:23.390 --> 04:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
years that wild aler that's been there
 
04:44:27.750 --> 04:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
for a long time and kept the
 
04:44:31.030 --> 04:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
the the soil and everything in place on
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
the edge is now the roots are totally
 
04:44:38.230 --> 04:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
exposed you can see right back to as far
 
04:44:42.030 --> 04:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
behind the roots and that's all from the
 
04:44:44.350 --> 04:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
uh wake and wave action that we've been
 
04:44:48.030 --> 04:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
seeing in the last two years and another
 
04:44:51.390 --> 04:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
thing that uh my husband is president of
 
04:44:54.430 --> 04:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
our association and I'm treasur so we
 
04:44:57.470 --> 04:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
get a lot of questions from time to time
 
04:44:59.830 --> 04:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
from people on the lake and people
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
visiting and the summer before last we
 
04:45:05.030 --> 04:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
had someone called
 
04:45:06.708 --> 04:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
and asked that they were thinking of
 
04:45:09.948 --> 04:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
renting on a lake and they asked us if
 
04:45:12.708 --> 04:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
there had been any cyano bacteria blooms
 
04:45:16.708 --> 04:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
on our Lake and at that time I could say
 
04:45:19.750 --> 04:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
no that we know didn't know of any and
 
04:45:22.830 --> 04:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
if there were we would probably know it
 
04:45:26.310 --> 04:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
and uh but I couldn't say that last year
 
04:45:28.708 --> 04:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
our excuse me could you get closer to
 
04:45:31.590 --> 04:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
the mic and tip it down a little bit so
 
04:45:34.830 --> 04:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
that oh I'm sorry yeah
 
04:45:39.350 --> 04:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay so I keep going okay so uh I don't
 
04:45:41.470 --> 04:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
know if you heard we had a question from
 
04:45:43.750 --> 04:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
someone who was considering renting on
 
04:45:47.708 --> 04:45:47.718 align:start position:0%
the lake and uh they asked if there had
 
04:45:49.948 --> 04:45:49.958 align:start position:0%
been a cyano bacteria Bloom on our Lake
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
this is summer before last and uh at
 
04:45:55.510 --> 04:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
that time we could say no we knew of
 
04:45:59.350 --> 04:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
none that had happened that changed last
 
04:46:02.350 --> 04:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
this past summer there were three blooms
 
04:46:06.230 --> 04:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
so it goes to show it really does it
 
04:46:09.510 --> 04:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
will affect the economy and the value of
 
04:46:12.390 --> 04:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
property around the lake if our
 
04:46:15.628 --> 04:46:15.638 align:start position:0%
Shoreline is eroded and if there a cyano
 
04:46:18.788 --> 04:46:18.798 align:start position:0%
bacteria blooms I believe in the
 
04:46:20.990 --> 04:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
recreation we as I said our family has
 
04:46:24.030 --> 04:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
enjoyed that Lake for many many years
 
04:46:26.390 --> 04:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
but we've there's a balance you need to
 
04:46:28.390 --> 04:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
take care of your Lake
 
04:46:30.390 --> 04:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
too thank
 
04:46:33.590 --> 04:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
you any questions by me for members of
 
04:46:39.470 --> 04:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:45.030 --> 04:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:48.670 --> 04:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
much from in propositions of the bill

Lake since my youth from family Tings in
 
04:47:37.390 --> 04:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
The Lakes Region to boating experiences
 
04:47:39.708 --> 04:47:39.718 align:start position:0%

Plymouth State College in
 
04:47:44.230 --> 04:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
2016 my lifelong love for these Waters
 
04:47:45.470 --> 04:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
culminating the acquisition of a
 
04:47:48.270 --> 04:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
waterfront home on wiip pasak residing
 
04:47:50.750 --> 04:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
year round in a small Cove on wiip
 
04:47:52.670 --> 04:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
were firsthand observers of the diverse
 
04:47:55.628 --> 04:47:55.638 align:start position:0%
watercraft can you also get closer and
 
04:47:57.830 --> 04:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
pull it up yeah you got it sorry guys
 
04:48:00.030 --> 04:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
speak so residing year round in a small
 
04:48:01.990 --> 04:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
Cove I'm wiip we were firsthand
 
04:48:04.750 --> 04:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
observers of diverse watercraft activity
 
04:48:06.948 --> 04:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
uh our small Cove attracts all boating
 
04:48:09.390 --> 04:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
types every summer day for its calm
 
04:48:11.788 --> 04:48:11.798 align:start position:0%
Waters but can barely fit one tuber or
 
04:48:14.470 --> 04:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
one water skier at a time or one wake
 
04:48:16.910 --> 04:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
surf boat at a time traditional boats
 
04:48:19.070 --> 04:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
pulling tubers in their quest to deliver
 
04:48:22.030 --> 04:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
thrilling rides weave chaotic patterns
 
04:48:23.910 --> 04:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
across the water creating large waves
 
04:48:25.510 --> 04:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
that while a source of joy for the
 
04:48:28.350 --> 04:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
participants contrast sharply with B
 
04:48:30.868 --> 04:48:30.878 align:start position:0%
behavior of wak surf boats I should know
 
04:48:33.590 --> 04:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
I do both of these things wak surf boats
 
04:48:34.910 --> 04:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
known for with their modest speed of
 
04:48:37.310 --> 04:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
approximately 11 mph Traverse our lakes
 
04:48:40.190 --> 04:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
and long predictable paths unlike large
 
04:48:43.270 --> 04:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
waves sorry unlike their tubing
 
04:48:45.708 --> 04:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
counterparts which at Double that speed
 
04:48:47.670 --> 04:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
craft large waves and erratic patterns
 
04:48:49.948 --> 04:48:49.958 align:start position:0%
to dislodge their passengers this
 
04:48:52.030 --> 04:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
unpredictable Behavior while fun poses
 
04:48:54.230 --> 04:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
challenges not only in navigation but
 
04:48:56.830 --> 04:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
also maintaining safety on the water
 
04:48:58.948 --> 04:48:58.958 align:start position:0%
this proposed law will not diminish any
 
04:49:01.910 --> 04:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
of these large tubing waves and while
 
04:49:04.190 --> 04:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
every watercraft category includes both
 
04:49:07.350 --> 04:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
responsible and less cautious operators
 
04:49:09.190 --> 04:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
wake surve driving Demands a higher
 
04:49:11.030 --> 04:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
level of skill and awareness these are
 
04:49:13.628 --> 04:49:13.638 align:start position:0%
not easy boats to drive this in turn
 
04:49:15.510 --> 04:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
Fosters a community of captains who are
 
04:49:17.670 --> 04:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
not only more familiar with the laws but
 
04:49:19.590 --> 04:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
also more deliberate in their navigation
 
04:49:22.868 --> 04:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
and prioritize safety I see it every day
 
04:49:26.430 --> 04:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
in our Cove that has over 2400 feet of
 
04:49:29.030 --> 04:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
wooded Shoreline or the larger Cove
 
04:49:31.510 --> 04:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
where we wake surf that has a 3M Long
 
04:49:34.548 --> 04:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
Cove of treelined water front front I
 
04:49:37.470 --> 04:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
have never once seen an uprooted
 
04:49:40.270 --> 04:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
Shoreline I care about our Waters I care
 
04:49:41.910 --> 04:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
deeply about them should I ever see
 
04:49:44.150 --> 04:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
evidence of shoreline erosion where I
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
boat on wiip I would Advocate to
 
04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
mitigate it my son a testament to the

 these young captains are far better

trained and have more advanced
 
04:50:19.910 --> 04:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
certifications than most captains on our
 
04:50:22.590 --> 04:50:22.600 align:start position:0%
Waters I urge you to oppose this law as
 
04:50:24.510 --> 04:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
it will only undermine such valuable

safe and healthy water sports activities
 
04:50:42.628 --> 04:50:42.638 align:start position:0%
this law will have no effect on the

amount or size of the waves that hit our
 
04:50:46.910 --> 04:50:46.920 align:start position:0%

burden an underresourced Marine Patrol

and the physical documentation is clear
 
04:52:01.270 --> 04:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
wakes generated by wake surfing are
 
04:52:03.150 --> 04:52:03.160 align:start position:0%
having a detrimental effect on water
 
04:52:04.910 --> 04:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
quality an aquatic
 
04:52:08.030 --> 04:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
habitat we're not against wake surfing
 
04:52:10.628 --> 04:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't look to ban it it just
 
04:52:13.708 --> 04:52:13.718 align:start position:0%
looks to establish better areas of the
 
04:52:15.788 --> 04:52:15.798 align:start position:0%
lake in which it should be
 
04:52:19.788 --> 04:52:19.798 align:start position:0%
conducted we know um from over 40 years
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
of data that phosphorus levels in the
 
04:52:24.750 --> 04:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
lake are increasing we know that
 
04:52:27.310 --> 04:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms are increasing in
 
04:52:29.150 --> 04:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
frequency and
 
04:52:31.830 --> 04:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
duration we know that boating on the
 
04:52:35.230 --> 04:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
lake has increased significant ly since
 
04:52:38.310 --> 04:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
covid we know that these wakes generated
 
04:52:40.670 --> 04:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
are causing shoreline erosion they churn
 
04:52:43.270 --> 04:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
up bottom Lake sediments and they do
 
04:52:45.750 --> 04:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
present safety hazards to people and
 
04:52:47.670 --> 04:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
children on the
 
04:52:50.990 --> 04:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
shore disturbing Lake Bottom sediments
 
04:52:55.548 --> 04:52:55.558 align:start position:0%
can cause clog fish gills kill fish eggs
 
04:52:58.430 --> 04:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
cause turbidity as has been mentioned
 
04:53:01.868 --> 04:53:01.878 align:start position:0%
and potentially tear up plant roots or
 
04:53:05.470 --> 04:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
fragment plants like mil oil communities
 
04:53:08.868 --> 04:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
have spent a lot of money to control and
 
04:53:11.510 --> 04:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
manage mil foil
 
04:53:14.548 --> 04:53:14.558 align:start position:0%
um let's see we know from the work that
 
04:53:17.350 --> 04:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
we've done that mitigation is expensive
 
04:53:19.830 --> 04:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
we've been conducting Watershed and
 
04:53:21.868 --> 04:53:21.878 align:start position:0%
water quality studies on
 
04:53:25.868 --> 04:53:25.878 align:start position:0%
wiip and we've identified over 270 sites
 
04:53:29.510 --> 04:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
on land that need to be fixed to reduce
 
04:53:32.830 --> 04:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
pollutant storm water and sediment load
 
04:53:36.270 --> 04:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
into the the lake these are estimated to
 
04:53:40.150 --> 04:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
cost at a conservative $2.8
 
04:53:45.030 --> 04:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
million so hold on and the state knows
 
04:53:46.910 --> 04:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
that mitigation is expensive because
 
04:53:49.548 --> 04:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
you've just established a cyano bacteria
 
04:53:53.430 --> 04:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
mitigation fund with a million
 
04:53:53.440 --> 04:53:55.190 align:start position:0%
mitigation fund with a million
dollars

04:53:55.190 --> 04:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:53:58.590 --> 04:53:58.600 align:start position:0%
s many Lake management strategies are
 
04:54:01.590 --> 04:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
difficult or expensive to implement
 
04:54:04.270 --> 04:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
establishing a wakes Sports Zone is a
 
04:54:06.948 --> 04:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
simple and reasonable measure that will
 
04:54:09.670 --> 04:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
ensure the enjoyment of sport continues
 
04:54:12.510 --> 04:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
while also protecting the sensitive and
 
04:54:15.150 --> 04:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
vulner vulnerable Nearshore zones of the
 
04:54:18.350 --> 04:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
lake along with the wildlife and Aquatic
 
04:54:21.070 --> 04:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
habitat and the good news is this
 
04:54:23.510 --> 04:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't really cost anything to do
 
04:54:25.548 --> 04:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
having a buffer is not like these other
 
04:54:28.590 --> 04:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
expensive mitigation things this is just
 
04:54:33.868 --> 04:54:33.878 align:start position:0%
one source of exacerbation of what we're
 
04:54:36.030 --> 04:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
seeing happening to our
 
04:54:39.948 --> 04:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
leges and in my testimony I've submitted
 
04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
we've also put out a map that shows the
 
04:54:46.270 --> 04:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
150t distance on winaki and the 500t
 
04:54:48.830 --> 04:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
distance proposed here and there's still
 
04:54:51.430 --> 04:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
a tremendous amount of Lake to enjoy for
 
04:54:54.868 --> 04:54:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:57.470 --> 04:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
you is there any questions by members of
 
04:54:57.480 --> 04:55:00.510 align:start position:0%
you is there any questions by members of
the

04:55:00.510 --> 04:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:04.430 --> 04:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none oh no
 
04:55:07.270 --> 04:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
if you guys don't speak up I'm that's
 
04:55:10.070 --> 04:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
just going to keep on going thank you um
 
04:55:11.548 --> 04:55:11.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:55:13.948 --> 04:55:13.958 align:start position:0%
my question so in your written testimony
 
04:55:16.910 --> 04:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify the what's the
 
04:55:19.548 --> 04:55:19.558 align:start position:0%
yellow and the blue line the yellow is
 
04:55:22.510 --> 04:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
the current 150 ft setb
 
04:55:25.670 --> 04:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
for no wake Headway speed and the 500
 
04:55:28.390 --> 04:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
shows where the five the blue lines of
 
04:55:32.070 --> 04:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
500 foot buffer okay thank you very much
 
04:55:35.868 --> 04:55:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
chair for our
 
04:55:39.868 --> 04:55:39.878 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:55:42.470 --> 04:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um since you're
 
04:55:45.270 --> 04:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
from uh the Lake winaki Association I
 
04:55:47.310 --> 04:55:47.320 align:start position:0%
presume this is a like a Property Owners
 
04:55:48.910 --> 04:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
Association that represents the property
 
04:55:50.990 --> 04:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
owners and we heard earlier that there's
 
04:55:53.750 --> 04:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
concerns about um property evaluations
 
04:55:55.150 --> 04:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
is is your membership concerned about
 
04:55:57.750 --> 04:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
property evaluations because of this
 
04:56:00.868 --> 04:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
bill our membership is concerned with
 
04:56:04.990 --> 04:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
property valuations um we know now that
 
04:56:08.390 --> 04:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh approximately $16 billion are
 
04:56:10.868 --> 04:56:10.878 align:start position:0%
property values on winaki we had a study
 
04:56:13.430 --> 04:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
done two years ago that said the value
 
04:56:15.708 --> 04:56:15.718 align:start position:0%
of wiip was 17
 
04:56:19.470 --> 04:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
billion um we are concerned with water
 
04:56:22.350 --> 04:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
quality degradation which will decrease
 
04:56:25.548 --> 04:56:25.558 align:start position:0%
property values and decreasing property
 
04:56:28.750 --> 04:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
values just means tax rate goes up for
 
04:56:32.350 --> 04:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
everybody followup for a followup thank
 
04:56:34.070 --> 04:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
04:56:36.910 --> 04:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
um have you or your members um
 
04:56:40.510 --> 04:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
experienced any specific sediment um
 
04:56:43.708 --> 04:56:43.718 align:start position:0%
disturbances because of um wake wake
 
04:56:46.350 --> 04:56:46.360 align:start position:0%
boats and wake surfing in
 
04:56:50.788 --> 04:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
particular so bottom sediments I can say
 
04:56:52.990 --> 04:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
if it's directly due to wake boats I
 
04:56:56.230 --> 04:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
cannot say that I can say that certain
 
04:56:59.708 --> 04:56:59.718 align:start position:0%
strains of cyanobacteria over winter in
 
04:57:02.190 --> 04:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
the bottom sediments so if you're
 
04:57:04.230 --> 04:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
disturbing those
 
04:57:06.310 --> 04:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
um that can stir that up and bring that
 
04:57:08.948 --> 04:57:08.958 align:start position:0%
up into the water column I know that
 
04:57:11.708 --> 04:57:11.718 align:start position:0%
there are some of our members here who
 
04:57:14.030 --> 04:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
can speak to witnessing shoreline
 
04:57:18.390 --> 04:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:20.470 --> 04:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
properties any other questions by
 
04:57:23.788 --> 04:57:23.798 align:start position:0%
members of the Committee hearing
 
04:57:28.830 --> 04:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
you I didn't hear you Mr representative
 
04:57:35.150 --> 04:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
wolf for a question thank you Mr
 
04:57:38.270 --> 04:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm going to uh ask you the
 
04:57:41.390 --> 04:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
same question that I asked to Mr Wall-E
 
04:57:43.350 --> 04:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
do you believe that there's any room for
 
04:57:50.548 --> 04:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:54.708 --> 04:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
here um possibly but I do believe that
 
04:57:57.270 --> 04:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
there's numerous scientific studies that
 
04:58:01.190 --> 04:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
have been done that show 500 ft is the
 
04:58:06.750 --> 04:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:10.070 --> 04:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:12.628 --> 04:58:12.638 align:start position:0%
you any other questions by members of
 
04:58:12.638 --> 04:58:13.708 align:start position:0%
you any other questions by members of
the

04:58:13.708 --> 04:58:13.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:58:21.750 --> 04:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:25.910 --> 04:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
much Jeremiah Burke from good you good
 
04:58:28.628 --> 04:58:28.638 align:start position:0%
you Boat Company speaking in opposition
 
04:58:31.590 --> 04:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:34.150 --> 04:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
bill good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
04:58:36.190 --> 04:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I appreciate
 
04:58:39.030 --> 04:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
the time today uh to share some thoughts
 
04:58:42.110 --> 04:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
with you I'm vice president of the New
 
04:58:44.548 --> 04:58:44.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Marine trades Association and
 
04:58:47.030 --> 04:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
general manager of good who Boat
 
04:58:50.590 --> 04:58:50.600 align:start position:0%
Company uh you may I recognize a few of
 
04:58:53.670 --> 04:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
you from uh as acting as a tour guide in
 
04:58:57.510 --> 04:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
Wolf bro uh this last summer um good
 
04:58:59.230 --> 04:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
Hugh we have four locations in New
 
04:59:03.510 --> 04:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and employ a staff of over 200
 
04:59:06.270 --> 04:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
people in the summertime that we oppose
 
04:59:07.830 --> 04:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:59:09.990 --> 04:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
1390 I believe we live in one of the
 
04:59:12.270 --> 04:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
most beautiful places on Earth I was
 
04:59:15.030 --> 04:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
born here I grew up here my wife and I
 
04:59:17.390 --> 04:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
choose to raise our five boys
 
04:59:19.788 --> 04:59:19.798 align:start position:0%
here I love the lakes and everything
 
04:59:22.670 --> 04:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
they have to offer my family like many
 
04:59:25.390 --> 04:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
others create memories and family bonds
 
04:59:28.430 --> 04:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
because of the time spent recreating on
 
04:59:30.910 --> 04:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
in and around the lakes of New
 
04:59:34.708 --> 04:59:34.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I assure you that is in all of
 
04:59:37.350 --> 04:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
our best interests to protect the lakes
 
04:59:39.470 --> 04:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
that are the lifeblood of our state and
 
04:59:42.230 --> 04:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
local economies and create many jobs for
 
04:59:44.070 --> 04:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:59:45.910 --> 04:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
residents while I understand the
 
04:59:47.628 --> 04:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
intentions that led to the introduction
 
04:59:49.990 --> 04:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill I firmly believe that house
 
04:59:53.270 --> 04:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
bill 1390 is not the answer this bill
 
04:59:56.470 --> 04:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
will restrict A specific group of boers
 
04:59:58.750 --> 04:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
and water sports enthusiasts who have
 
05:00:01.670 --> 05:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
the same rights as other users of public
 
05:00:06.350 --> 05:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
Waters if approved then who will be next
 
05:00:08.030 --> 05:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
the bill would also undermine the values
 
05:00:09.708 --> 05:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
and traditions of New Hampshire which
 
05:00:12.788 --> 05:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
are rooted deeply in Freedom House Bill
 
05:00:15.548 --> 05:00:15.558 align:start position:0%
1390 is
 
05:00:17.670 --> 05:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
discriminatory instead let us continue
 
05:00:19.230 --> 05:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
to focus on
 
05:00:21.548 --> 05:00:21.558 align:start position:0%
education our membership is doing our
 
05:00:23.708 --> 05:00:23.718 align:start position:0%
part to educate with the lake wake
 
05:00:26.628 --> 05:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
responsibly campaign information about
 
05:00:29.110 --> 05:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
our efforts to promote best practices in
 
05:00:31.868 --> 05:00:31.878 align:start position:0%
influence behavior is in your packet
 
05:00:34.470 --> 05:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
under tab three
 
05:00:36.270 --> 05:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
over the past couple of years we have
 
05:00:38.230 --> 05:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
spent tens of thousands of dollars times
 
05:00:41.150 --> 05:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
and resources on and energy on New
 
05:00:43.350 --> 05:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wake
 
05:00:45.948 --> 05:00:45.958 align:start position:0%
responsibly uh we have more work to do
 
05:00:48.868 --> 05:00:48.878 align:start position:0%
there is also Senate Bill 431 that
 
05:00:50.868 --> 05:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
promotes these efforts that we should
 
05:00:50.878 --> 05:00:52.510 align:start position:0%
promotes these efforts that we should
all

05:00:52.510 --> 05:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:00:55.350 --> 05:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
support another topic that needs to be
 
05:00:56.868 --> 05:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
addressed is
 
05:00:59.110 --> 05:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement we have dedicated members of
 
05:01:01.150 --> 05:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol patrolling th New
 
05:01:03.548 --> 05:01:03.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's thousand lakes
 
05:01:06.670 --> 05:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
but getting fewer in number did you know
 
05:01:10.070 --> 05:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
in 2023 we only had 30 Marine Patrol
 
05:01:14.070 --> 05:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
officers enforcing voting laws 30 and
 
05:01:16.150 --> 05:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
come to find out about a third of those
 
05:01:18.510 --> 05:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
are administrative staff not even
 
05:01:20.948 --> 05:01:20.958 align:start position:0%
patrolling the actual
 
05:01:23.070 --> 05:01:23.080 align:start position:0%
Lakes this is the lowest number of
 
05:01:25.548 --> 05:01:25.558 align:start position:0%
officers in memory many remember when we
 
05:01:27.910 --> 05:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
were concerned when we only had 60
 
05:01:30.430 --> 05:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
officers now we have half that
 
05:01:32.788 --> 05:01:32.798 align:start position:0%
number helping helping increase Marine
 
05:01:34.510 --> 05:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
stream Patrol officers should be the
 
05:01:36.110 --> 05:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
reason this room is
 
05:01:38.670 --> 05:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
filled with more officers enforcing the
 
05:01:41.390 --> 05:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
laws that we have there will be fewer
 
05:01:42.708 --> 05:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
problems on the
 
05:01:45.070 --> 05:01:45.080 align:start position:0%
lake finally let's talk about the
 
05:01:47.350 --> 05:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
environment Mother Nature is the biggest
 
05:01:50.110 --> 05:01:50.120 align:start position:0%
contributor to Shoreline issues the
 
05:01:52.390 --> 05:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
phosphates and fertilizers septic
 
05:01:55.350 --> 05:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
systems municipalities storm water to
 
05:01:58.270 --> 05:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
name a few are what really causes issues
 
05:01:59.510 --> 05:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
for water
 
05:02:01.670 --> 05:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
quality in conclusion I'll give you one
 
05:02:03.948 --> 05:02:03.958 align:start position:0%
quick example of how we can work
 
05:02:05.750 --> 05:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
together and educate the
 
05:02:08.708 --> 05:02:08.718 align:start position:0%
public uh we see things at the marina
 
05:02:10.190 --> 05:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
that others do not
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
see uh we have seen boats come into our
 
05:02:15.310 --> 05:02:15.320 align:start position:0%
boat launch that are not fit to launch
 
05:02:18.590 --> 05:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
because in this example algae
 
05:02:22.150 --> 05:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
growth uh is not healthy for our Waters
 
05:02:24.590 --> 05:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
and and we do not let them launch until
 
05:02:26.990 --> 05:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
fully cleansed and washed there's a
 
05:02:28.990 --> 05:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
picture in your packet that shows an
 
05:02:31.868 --> 05:02:31.878 align:start position:0%
example of what happened when uh someone
 
05:02:34.548 --> 05:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
came to try to Launch lach their boat uh
 
05:02:36.868 --> 05:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
so we cleaned their boat uh the next
 
05:02:38.868 --> 05:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
year when that person came back for
 
05:02:41.230 --> 05:02:41.240 align:start position:0%
their vacation they came back and the
 
05:02:43.150 --> 05:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
boat was already cleaned and he came and
 
05:02:45.390 --> 05:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
he found me out and he said guess look
 
05:02:48.548 --> 05:02:48.558 align:start position:0%
at my boat I cleaned it before I came uh
 
05:02:51.628 --> 05:02:51.638 align:start position:0%
so Education Works uh thank you for your
 
05:02:54.070 --> 05:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
time and I ask you to vote against House
 
05:02:54.080 --> 05:02:56.708 align:start position:0%
time and I ask you to vote against House
Bill

05:02:56.708 --> 05:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:59.350 --> 05:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
1390 any questions by members of the
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
committee I have one Mr
 
05:03:04.590 --> 05:03:04.600 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative rung for
 
05:03:06.750 --> 05:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
a question okay thank you Mr chair thank
 
05:03:09.070 --> 05:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question Mr Brook um
 
05:03:11.110 --> 05:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
you talk about the values and traditions
 
05:03:13.948 --> 05:03:13.958 align:start position:0%
of boating in New Hampshire can you tell
 
05:03:17.270 --> 05:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
me when did wake boats get introduced
 
05:03:19.510 --> 05:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
and when did just the regular votes get
 
05:03:22.628 --> 05:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
re get introduced like what's the
 
05:03:24.548 --> 05:03:24.558 align:start position:0%
timeline uh when I started in the
 
05:03:26.830 --> 05:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
industry which was 10 years ago it was
 
05:03:29.070 --> 05:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
prior to 10 years ago so I would i'
 
05:03:32.470 --> 05:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
think it was probably 15 15 plus years
 
05:03:32.480 --> 05:03:36.670 align:start position:0%
think it was probably 15 15 plus years
ago

05:03:36.670 --> 05:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:39.030 --> 05:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
ago any other questions by members of
 
05:03:39.040 --> 05:03:42.270 align:start position:0%
ago any other questions by members of
the

05:03:42.270 --> 05:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:44.948 --> 05:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
committee representative thank you for
 
05:03:45.910 --> 05:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
05:03:48.868 --> 05:03:48.878 align:start position:0%
question I'm just listening to all of
 
05:03:51.150 --> 05:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
this and maybe you're the best person to
 
05:03:54.990 --> 05:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
ask how many wake boats are there choose
 
05:03:56.948 --> 05:03:56.958 align:start position:0%
your Lake wiip
 
05:04:02.350 --> 05:04:02.360 align:start position:0%
 um walki Wan Squam new I mean how
 
05:04:07.548 --> 05:04:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:10.990 --> 05:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
on is has good hum Marines sold within
 
05:04:14.990 --> 05:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
the last five years uh so we
 
05:04:17.990 --> 05:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
sell I don't know the answer you know
 
05:04:19.470 --> 05:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you from our experience
 
05:04:21.750 --> 05:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
certainly there's other dealers um
 
05:04:25.030 --> 05:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
around um we sell approximately maybe 30
 
05:04:28.070 --> 05:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
boats uh a year uh between a couple of
 
05:04:30.670 --> 05:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
dealerships it's not a huge quantity of
 
05:04:32.788 --> 05:04:32.798 align:start position:0%
boats um by all means when you you look
 
05:04:34.548 --> 05:04:34.558 align:start position:0%
at the amount of boat
 
05:04:36.548 --> 05:04:36.558 align:start position:0%
registrations uh that are registered in
 
05:04:39.350 --> 05:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that total over 100,000
 
05:04:44.030 --> 05:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
boats um so it's by by comparison it's
 
05:04:45.910 --> 05:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
far fewer than than the rest of the
 
05:04:49.150 --> 05:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
Boating that happens out
 
05:04:52.868 --> 05:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
there any other any other questions Mr
 
05:04:55.910 --> 05:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
chair over here
 
05:04:58.830 --> 05:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
that representative Derby for question
 
05:05:00.110 --> 05:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:05:02.868 --> 05:05:02.878 align:start position:0%
my question I understand that Marine the
 
05:05:04.628 --> 05:05:04.638 align:start position:0%
Marine trades Association or you know
 
05:05:08.350 --> 05:05:08.360 align:start position:0%
related groups um have an education
 
05:05:11.510 --> 05:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
Campaign which I applaud to um you know
 
05:05:14.948 --> 05:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
to educate um wake Surfers one of the
 
05:05:17.470 --> 05:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
things that I see missing um from that
 
05:05:20.390 --> 05:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
is a concern about the depth um and the
 
05:05:22.750 --> 05:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
impacts to the sediment and I'm
 
05:05:24.070 --> 05:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
wondering if the Marine trades
 
05:05:28.030 --> 05:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
Association is planning on um on
 
05:05:31.070 --> 05:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
including that in their materials in be
 
05:05:34.390 --> 05:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
since the propulsion is at a much
 
05:05:37.628 --> 05:05:37.638 align:start position:0%
steeper angle than a traditional boat
 
05:05:39.868 --> 05:05:39.878 align:start position:0%
such that you can generate the
 
05:05:42.070 --> 05:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
wake uh as far as depths I mean
 
05:05:44.350 --> 05:05:44.360 align:start position:0%
certainly it's that's not something
 
05:05:46.430 --> 05:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
that's enforceable I mean how do you
 
05:05:49.830 --> 05:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
tell what depth uh you know a boat is at
 
05:05:51.788 --> 05:05:51.798 align:start position:0%
unless you have a transducer that
 
05:05:54.788 --> 05:05:54.798 align:start position:0%
measures the depth in that area um and
 
05:05:57.390 --> 05:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
and so enforcing something like a depth
 
05:05:59.708 --> 05:05:59.718 align:start position:0%
uh it would be very difficult however I
 
05:06:02.910 --> 05:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
I also believe the the setbacks of
 
05:06:06.910 --> 05:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
um 150 feet and and what's proposed in
 
05:06:10.430 --> 05:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh Senate Bill 431 of 200 feet you're
 
05:06:12.350 --> 05:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
already passed a lot of those shallow
 
05:06:15.030 --> 05:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
depths at that point um and so I don't
 
05:06:18.670 --> 05:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:21.190 --> 05:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
issue any other questions by members of
 
05:06:21.200 --> 05:06:23.270 align:start position:0%
issue any other questions by members of
the

05:06:23.270 --> 05:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:06:31.390 --> 05:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:34.910 --> 05:06:34.920 align:start position:0%

05:06:34.920 --> 05:06:51.910 align:start position:0%
much in support of the bill Gary York
three

05:06:51.910 --> 05:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:54.548 --> 05:06:54.558 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chair and members
 
05:06:56.628 --> 05:06:56.638 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Gary yor
 
05:06:58.910 --> 05:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
from hopkington New
 
05:07:01.628 --> 05:07:01.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is not your grandmother's
 
05:07:04.750 --> 05:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
Waker boat that we're dealing
 
05:07:08.750 --> 05:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
with I'd like to refer to a study done
 
05:07:12.990 --> 05:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
in Minnesota in 2021 later published in
 
05:07:14.628 --> 05:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
February of
 
05:07:17.750 --> 05:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
22 of which I will provide you with a
 
05:07:20.990 --> 05:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
PDF copy all of you by
 
05:07:23.310 --> 05:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
email in this
 
05:07:27.430 --> 05:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
study they looked at four different
 
05:07:30.948 --> 05:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
boats two of which were your traditional
 
05:07:35.590 --> 05:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
fast ski boats Towing skiers
 
05:07:39.750 --> 05:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
hydroplaning or uh Towing tubers the
 
05:07:43.470 --> 05:07:43.480 align:start position:0%
other two boats are the new fangled
 
05:07:47.750 --> 05:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
nuisance uh wave surf boats one of the
 
05:07:50.310 --> 05:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
two having an
 
05:07:55.390 --> 05:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
aftermarket uh U option which in fact
 
05:07:58.510 --> 05:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
increased the wave height uh if it
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't high enough already by
 
05:08:01.200 --> 05:08:02.708 align:start position:0%
wasn't high enough already by
33%

05:08:02.708 --> 05:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
33%
 
05:08:05.430 --> 05:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
so for purposes of the study I would
 
05:08:09.190 --> 05:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
just refer to the dimensions of the room
 
05:08:10.990 --> 05:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
from window to
 
05:08:15.230 --> 05:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
window and let's just say that's 100 ft
 
05:08:19.470 --> 05:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
for the two conventional ski
 
05:08:23.548 --> 05:08:23.558 align:start position:0%
boats uh passing by let's say going in
 
05:08:26.430 --> 05:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
this direction comparing that to the two
 
05:08:29.310 --> 05:08:29.320 align:start position:0%
wake surf boats at the same
 
05:08:34.190 --> 05:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
distance and that is 100 ft
 
05:08:37.830 --> 05:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
the wake surf boats compared to the
 
05:08:39.910 --> 05:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
traditional ski
 
05:08:43.150 --> 05:08:43.160 align:start position:0%
boats uh measured two to three times
 
05:08:44.830 --> 05:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
more wave
 
05:08:48.230 --> 05:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
height two to three times more wave
 
05:08:51.430 --> 05:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
height they measured anywhere from three
 
05:08:54.788 --> 05:08:54.798 align:start position:0%
to nine times increased energy in the
 
05:08:57.708 --> 05:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
wave produced by the wak surf boats over
 
05:09:00.670 --> 05:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
traditional boats three to three to nine
 
05:09:03.750 --> 05:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
times more energy
 
05:09:07.628 --> 05:09:07.638 align:start position:0%
the waves the WG surf boats produced 6
 
05:09:12.150 --> 05:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
to 12 times more power when measured at
 
05:09:14.270 --> 05:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
the analyzing
 
05:09:17.030 --> 05:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
stations that gives you an idea of some
 
05:09:20.110 --> 05:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
hard data that does
 
05:09:23.110 --> 05:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
support increased effects of erosion no
 
05:09:25.548 --> 05:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
one can deny that that amount of energy
 
05:09:28.510 --> 05:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
and power increase is going to have less
 
05:09:30.310 --> 05:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
of an effect this is going to have more
 
05:09:32.788 --> 05:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
of an effect on erosion and everything
 
05:09:34.910 --> 05:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
that relates to
 
05:09:37.788 --> 05:09:37.798 align:start position:0%
that and as a comparison how does a how
 
05:09:41.510 --> 05:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
does a wake surf boat compare to a
 
05:09:43.910 --> 05:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
traditional speed boat as far as wave
 
05:09:46.510 --> 05:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
propagation energy and so on so let's
 
05:09:48.590 --> 05:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
let's now take this distance of 200 ft
 
05:09:50.430 --> 05:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
between the
 
05:09:54.390 --> 05:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
windows and the traditional ski boats
 
05:09:57.990 --> 05:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
produce wave heights energy and power at
 
05:10:00.548 --> 05:10:00.558 align:start position:0%
200 ft that measures
 
05:10:03.190 --> 05:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
X to have that that
 
05:10:08.590 --> 05:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
same characteristic wave in a wake
 
05:10:11.070 --> 05:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
surfboat the wake surf boat would have
 
05:10:16.190 --> 05:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
to be 500 ft away to produce that same
 
05:10:18.788 --> 05:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
effect so that's clear evidence that
 
05:10:22.350 --> 05:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
that is more energy more power creating
 
05:10:25.510 --> 05:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
havoc on the shoreline creating Havoc
 
05:10:29.310 --> 05:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
for uh small craft paddlers paddle
 
05:10:32.548 --> 05:10:32.558 align:start position:0%
borders people in a canoe
 
05:10:34.868 --> 05:10:34.878 align:start position:0%
more that
 
05:10:39.150 --> 05:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
effort so in summary I would say that um
 
05:10:39.160 --> 05:10:39.948 align:start position:0%
effort so in summary I would say that um
I

05:10:39.948 --> 05:10:39.958 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:10:43.510 --> 05:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
support uh the bill as it stands
 
05:10:45.030 --> 05:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
although would be open to some
 
05:10:47.788 --> 05:10:47.798 align:start position:0%
compromise as representative wolf has
 
05:10:50.030 --> 05:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
recommend perhaps or
 
05:10:54.270 --> 05:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
question um I think the main issue is
 
05:10:57.510 --> 05:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
and I see it today on the lake
 
05:11:01.708 --> 05:11:01.718 align:start position:0%
U uh enforcement so that's another issue
 
05:11:03.190 --> 05:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
but should be another bill that would
 
05:11:06.350 --> 05:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
increase funding for enforcement of this
 
05:11:06.360 --> 05:11:07.750 align:start position:0%
increase funding for enforcement of this
thank

05:11:07.750 --> 05:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:11:12.110 --> 05:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
you there any questions uh for the uh
 
05:11:13.990 --> 05:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:11:16.150 --> 05:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
can hearing

05:11:28.150 --> 05:11:28.160 align:start position:0%

don't tell me there's two people with

05:11:45.150 --> 05:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
name for three
 
05:11:47.788 --> 05:11:47.798 align:start position:0%
minutes hello everyone my name is Ryan
 
05:11:50.190 --> 05:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
Liberty and I'm from B New Hampshire I
 
05:11:52.230 --> 05:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
am in e8th grade and I go to B Memorial
 
05:11:54.070 --> 05:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
School I have been wake surfing for most
 
05:11:56.830 --> 05:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
of my life um we tried it on vacation
 
05:11:58.910 --> 05:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
did you get closer to the
 
05:12:02.190 --> 05:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
microphone um um we tried it on vacation
 
05:12:03.670 --> 05:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
and my whole family has loved it ever
 
05:12:05.830 --> 05:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
since we bought our own boat so we can
 
05:12:07.830 --> 05:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
spend our summers in new boating in New
 
05:12:09.750 --> 05:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now the best part about this
 
05:12:11.548 --> 05:12:11.558 align:start position:0%
is that we get to be together talk
 
05:12:13.628 --> 05:12:13.638 align:start position:0%
exercise have fun and have a break from
 
05:12:16.750 --> 05:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
our screens I go to waterm camp on Mary
 
05:12:18.990 --> 05:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
meeting Lake it is a sleep away camp
 
05:12:20.510 --> 05:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
that I have gone to for the past three
 
05:12:22.788 --> 05:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
Summers my little brother started going
 
05:12:25.150 --> 05:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
with me last year um I hope to work
 
05:12:27.190 --> 05:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
there when I'm old enough this bill
 
05:12:28.910 --> 05:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
would impact that because of the size of
 
05:12:31.070 --> 05:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
Mary meeting Lake this bill would also
 
05:12:32.830 --> 05:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
impact the lake that my family spends
 
05:12:35.150 --> 05:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
time on because of the 500 foot setback
 
05:12:38.150 --> 05:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
because the 500 foot setback means we
 
05:12:40.548 --> 05:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
can't use our Surf Boat there anymore a
 
05:12:43.910 --> 05:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
500t setback will make any lakes wide
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
enough much more crowded for surfing
 
05:12:48.030 --> 05:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
overcrowding will make it more likely
 
05:12:49.548 --> 05:12:49.558 align:start position:0%
that people will get hurt because
 
05:12:50.948 --> 05:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
everyone will have to serve together on
 
05:12:54.590 --> 05:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
fewer Lakes the 200t setback for Senate
 
05:12:59.190 --> 05:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
bill for 4 431 which I testified in
 
05:13:01.190 --> 05:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
favor of would be a much better solution
 
05:13:03.230 --> 05:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
to both increase the setback by also
 
05:13:05.070 --> 05:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
allowing people to surf and keep us all
 
05:13:07.270 --> 05:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
safe thank you for listening and for
 
05:13:09.030 --> 05:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
your consideration please oppose House

question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:17:40.190 --> 05:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question as a member of
 
05:17:41.750 --> 05:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
the Springfield uh Conservation
 
05:17:44.590 --> 05:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
Commission and I noticed that uh little
 
05:17:47.350 --> 05:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
Sunny lake is in Springfield which is a
 
05:17:49.990 --> 05:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
472 acre Lake I was wondering if you'd
 
05:17:53.310 --> 05:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
ever seen 4ot natural waves on that
 
05:17:56.628 --> 05:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
Lake I am not personally on that Lake I
 
05:17:59.270 --> 05:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
do however interact with families that
 
05:18:01.948 --> 05:18:01.958 align:start position:0%
own property on the lake um in my
 
05:18:04.590 --> 05:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
involvement with lspa and some other
 
05:18:06.750 --> 05:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
organizations um I have heard that there
 
05:18:10.030 --> 05:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
are concerns um erosion is certainly a
 
05:18:13.470 --> 05:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
concern I know that on our specific Lake
 
05:18:16.030 --> 05:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
um contained entirely in Springfield
 
05:18:18.910 --> 05:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
Lake kimok there are certain concerns
 
05:18:21.548 --> 05:18:21.558 align:start position:0%
due to the type of lake that it is that
 
05:18:24.990 --> 05:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
it does not have as much plant growth as
 
05:18:28.470 --> 05:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
other a Lakes do and therefore any type
 
05:18:30.670 --> 05:18:30.680 align:start position:0%
of erosion could be very detrimental to
 
05:18:34.470 --> 05:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:37.430 --> 05:18:37.440 align:start position:0%

that this is a bill that Dees is
 
05:19:08.628 --> 05:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
tracking it's on their list um would you
 
05:19:10.868 --> 05:19:10.878 align:start position:0%
mind asking if we are to expect any
 
05:19:13.030 --> 05:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
written testimony from the Department
 
05:19:16.470 --> 05:19:16.480 align:start position:0%

05:19:19.030 --> 05:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
session we're not going into executive
 
05:19:23.590 --> 05:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
session today no but when we whenever we
 
05:19:25.948 --> 05:19:25.958 align:start position:0%
do because it is being would you repeat
 
05:19:28.230 --> 05:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
it so I could I only heard part of it
 
05:19:32.110 --> 05:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
what exactly did you say to I know that
 
05:19:35.150 --> 05:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire Dees has listed this
 
05:19:37.590 --> 05:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
bill among the list of bills that they
 
05:19:40.310 --> 05:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
are tracking this year and I was
 
05:19:42.310 --> 05:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
wondering since it is a bill they are
 
05:19:46.070 --> 05:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
tracking if we would be um if we should
 
05:19:49.390 --> 05:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
expect to get some testimony on on um
 
05:19:52.230 --> 05:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
their opinion on this bill um before we
 
05:19:54.670 --> 05:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
have to make a decision whether that is
 
05:19:57.350 --> 05:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
in a week or two weeks or whenever
 
05:19:59.628 --> 05:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
that's right now I don't think that
 
05:20:02.270 --> 05:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
that's something before us they will get
 
05:20:05.230 --> 05:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
something that information to us
 
05:20:09.948 --> 05:20:09.958 align:start position:0%

1.9% of space for Wake
 
05:23:51.868 --> 05:23:51.878 align:start position:0%
Sports please note that these
 
05:23:53.830 --> 05:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
percentages speak to what is generally
 
05:23:55.990 --> 05:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
available in Recreation areas for Wake
 
05:23:58.350 --> 05:23:58.360 align:start position:0%
Sports if no other boats are in
 
05:24:01.350 --> 05:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
operation on that body of water it also
 
05:24:03.150 --> 05:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
does not address Islands other
 
05:24:05.548 --> 05:24:05.558 align:start position:0%
structures or any depth requirements as
 
05:24:07.708 --> 05:24:07.718 align:start position:0%
proposed in this house
 
05:24:10.910 --> 05:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
bill if 1390 was to become law you can
 
05:24:12.948 --> 05:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
see that all of these water bodies would
 
05:24:15.110 --> 05:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
be restricted so the lake be populated
 
05:24:17.948 --> 05:24:17.958 align:start position:0%
by one or two other water Craft on a
 
05:24:20.230 --> 05:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
typical boating day the Wake sport
 
05:24:22.510 --> 05:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
activity you enjoy as a family is simply
 
05:24:24.910 --> 05:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
no longer Avail uh possible or Available
 
05:24:29.510 --> 05:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
to You 1390 is simply a ban on Wake
 
05:24:31.948 --> 05:24:31.958 align:start position:0%
Sports a allow me to put into context
 
05:24:34.350 --> 05:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
what 500 ft looks like better yet what
 
05:24:37.750 --> 05:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
1,000 ft looks like as 1390 calls for
 
05:24:40.910 --> 05:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
that space 500 ft to Port 500 ft to
 
05:24:43.750 --> 05:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
starboard 500 ft to Bow and

Stern in your packet under tab number
 
05:24:48.390 --> 05:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
two you'll see seven examples of this
 
05:24:51.910 --> 05:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
proposed setback distance should 1390
 
05:24:55.230 --> 05:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
pass our new area of operation as a wake
 
05:24:58.708 --> 05:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
Sports operator is 1,000 ft
 
05:25:01.948 --> 05:25:01.958 align:start position:0%
wide this distance is 10 ft short of
 
05:25:05.070 --> 05:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
three NFL football fields linked end to
 
05:25:08.070 --> 05:25:08.080 align:start position:0%

05:25:10.910 --> 05:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
store Street Parking Garage in conquered
 
05:25:12.750 --> 05:25:12.760 align:start position:0%

05:25:18.750 --> 05:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
ft picture the confusion created when an
 
05:25:20.830 --> 05:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
oncoming vessel impedes this new
 
05:25:23.830 --> 05:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
potential wake zone which boat which
 
05:25:25.750 --> 05:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
operator is in the wrong and which will
 
05:25:27.628 --> 05:25:27.638 align:start position:0%
be breaking a proposed
 
05:25:30.830 --> 05:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
law our industry believes and stands
 
05:25:32.990 --> 05:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
behind a more balanced solution in
 
05:25:36.430 --> 05:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 431 Senate Bill 431 is
 
05:25:38.628 --> 05:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
currently working through the Senate and
 
05:25:40.830 --> 05:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
can provide the pathway forward to
 
05:25:43.310 --> 05:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
balance all the issues Public Access
 
05:25:45.708 --> 05:25:45.718 align:start position:0%
economics environment and avoids
 
05:25:48.948 --> 05:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
navigation confusion I urge you to vote
 
05:25:50.990 --> 05:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
and oppose legislation in front of you
 
05:25:53.788 --> 05:25:53.798 align:start position:0%
and find 1390
 
05:25:56.310 --> 05:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
itl thank
 
05:25:59.230 --> 05:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
you any any questions or members of the
 
05:26:01.910 --> 05:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
committee Mr chair I have a
 
05:26:05.190 --> 05:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
question yes okay or a question okay and
 
05:26:06.910 --> 05:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr MCC for accepting my
 
05:26:08.990 --> 05:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
question um you mentioned your home lake
 
05:26:11.670 --> 05:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
is Northwood Lake I'm curious have they
 
05:26:14.230 --> 05:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
experienced any cyano bacteria blooms
 
05:26:16.750 --> 05:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
and have been has that been attributed
 
05:26:20.990 --> 05:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
to any disturbance in the sediment or
 
05:26:23.110 --> 05:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
erosion we we have Through The Years
 
05:26:26.670 --> 05:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
this year is particularly bad due to 17
 
05:26:28.510 --> 05:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
possible boating weekends and 14
 
05:26:29.590 --> 05:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
weekends of
 
05:26:29.600 --> 05:26:33.430 align:start position:0%
weekends of
rain

05:26:33.430 --> 05:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:39.230 --> 05:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:42.430 --> 05:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
committee representative L mon thank you
 
05:26:44.628 --> 05:26:44.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
05:26:47.750 --> 05:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
question um certainly by looking at your
 
05:26:50.708 --> 05:26:50.718 align:start position:0%
map some of the smaller Lakes especially
 
05:26:54.470 --> 05:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
if they're narrow the the area for
 
05:26:57.788 --> 05:26:57.798 align:start position:0%
recreation which you mean wake sporting
 
05:27:00.270 --> 05:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
um is very limited but do you believe
 
05:27:00.280 --> 05:27:01.310 align:start position:0%
um is very limited but do you believe
that

05:27:01.310 --> 05:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:27:04.070 --> 05:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
many small and many small lakes that it
 
05:27:08.510 --> 05:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
probably is unwise or inappropriate to
 
05:27:08.520 --> 05:27:10.788 align:start position:0%
probably is unwise or inappropriate to
wakeboard

05:27:10.788 --> 05:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
wakeboard
 
05:27:13.670 --> 05:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
no I strategically selected those Lakes
 
05:27:15.150 --> 05:27:15.160 align:start position:0%
because they're within the market that
 
05:27:16.270 --> 05:27:16.280 align:start position:0%
my business
 
05:27:20.150 --> 05:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
serves and to to be quite Frank I've
 
05:27:22.750 --> 05:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
been battling this issue for over five
 
05:27:25.230 --> 05:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
years and we're we're trying to find
 
05:27:27.990 --> 05:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
home and and my efforts to create the
 
05:27:32.190 --> 05:27:32.200 align:start position:0%
maps were to find an agreeable balance
 
05:27:34.548 --> 05:27:34.558 align:start position:0%
but clearly 500 ft
 
05:27:39.470 --> 05:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:44.948 --> 05:27:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:47.788 --> 05:27:47.798 align:start position:0%
followup but with many of these small
 
05:27:52.628 --> 05:27:52.638 align:start position:0%
lakes um it doesn't prohibit other
 
05:27:54.708 --> 05:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
Recreation on the
 
05:28:01.150 --> 05:28:01.160 align:start position:0%
lake do you feel that in a small Lake um
 
05:28:03.948 --> 05:28:03.958 align:start position:0%
if it's very small the wake boarding
 
05:28:07.110 --> 05:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
really limits the use by other types of
 
05:28:09.150 --> 05:28:09.160 align:start position:0%
um water
 
05:28:11.948 --> 05:28:11.958 align:start position:0%
activities I I don't believe that uh
 
05:28:14.788 --> 05:28:14.798 align:start position:0%
Wick responsibly speaks very clearly to
 
05:28:17.110 --> 05:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
Safe passage and our industry supports
 
05:28:17.120 --> 05:28:21.030 align:start position:0%
Safe passage and our industry supports
that

05:28:21.030 --> 05:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:24.310 --> 05:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
distance any additional
 
05:28:27.270 --> 05:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
questions Mr
 
05:28:29.430 --> 05:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
chair I don't have an additional
 
05:28:32.390 --> 05:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
question um but I do want to um
 
05:28:33.948 --> 05:28:33.958 align:start position:0%
representative Darby brought to my
 
05:28:35.670 --> 05:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
attention that we did receive a letter
 
05:28:39.430 --> 05:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
of testimony from Dees yesterday around
 
05:28:42.990 --> 05:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
10:00 I I didn't have it in my um inbox
 
05:28:45.110 --> 05:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to alert the rest of
 
05:28:46.830 --> 05:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
the committee that we have received
 
05:28:48.750 --> 05:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
their testimony and they're not taking a
 
05:28:51.510 --> 05:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
position thank
 
05:28:56.310 --> 05:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:59.030 --> 05:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
right any other questions by members of
 
05:29:01.910 --> 05:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none thank you very
 
05:29:04.350 --> 05:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much we just been
 
05:29:07.270 --> 05:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
doing some count C counting here folks
 
05:29:10.030 --> 05:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh just let you know we did the first
 
05:29:12.190 --> 05:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
hour we did 10 and I think we have
 
05:29:15.350 --> 05:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
enough for three more hours so we'll
 
05:29:15.360 --> 05:29:18.110 align:start position:0%
enough for three more hours so we'll
keep

05:29:18.110 --> 05:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:23.510 --> 05:29:23.520 align:start position:0%

speak in support of the bill for three
 
05:29:29.320 --> 05:29:32.190 align:start position:0%
speak in support of the bill for three
minutes

05:29:32.190 --> 05:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
05:29:34.310 --> 05:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
somebody hopefully somebody does three
 
05:29:36.628 --> 05:29:36.638 align:start position:0%
minutes I'll try thank

since

05:30:12.948 --> 05:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
since
 
05:30:16.470 --> 05:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
2016 each year I have seen a continuing
 
05:30:19.708 --> 05:30:19.718 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of wake surf
 
05:30:22.230 --> 05:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
boats and the increase in size and
 
05:30:24.110 --> 05:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
displacement of these
 
05:30:26.910 --> 05:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
boats I have had significant damage to
 
05:30:29.070 --> 05:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
my Shoreline including five trees
 
05:30:31.150 --> 05:30:31.160 align:start position:0%
falling into the pond due to shoreline
 
05:30:33.590 --> 05:30:33.600 align:start position:0%

the

05:30:34.390 --> 05:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:30:37.590 --> 05:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
shore I have been tossed while sitting
 
05:30:40.910 --> 05:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
on my dock from the large waves
 
05:30:43.430 --> 05:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
uplifting my dock from boats passing by
 
05:30:45.948 --> 05:30:45.958 align:start position:0%
Within 200 to 300
 
05:30:50.230 --> 05:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
fet when kayaking I need to stop and
 
05:30:52.628 --> 05:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
brace myself for the oncoming
 
05:30:56.150 --> 05:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
wave I have resigned to kayaking mainly
 
05:30:58.470 --> 05:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
in the morning when the Wake surfboats
 
05:31:00.868 --> 05:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
are at their docks
 
05:31:04.110 --> 05:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
in addition the large waves churn the
 
05:31:07.110 --> 05:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
water in the shallow areas less than 20
 
05:31:10.390 --> 05:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
ft of water causing the pond B bottom
 
05:31:12.270 --> 05:31:12.280 align:start position:0%
muck to wash
 
05:31:15.470 --> 05:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
ashore I have noticed that when
 
05:31:18.310 --> 05:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
considerate wake boers stay in the
 
05:31:21.510 --> 05:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
center of the pond around 200 excuse me
 
05:31:24.750 --> 05:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
around 400 to 500 feet from the shore
 
05:31:28.030 --> 05:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
the effects of the Waves
 
05:31:30.590 --> 05:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
diminished as a member of the car robbit
 
05:31:35.510 --> 05:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
Pawn vlap teams since 2017 I have seen a
 
05:31:39.470 --> 05:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
steady declining trend of water Clary in
 
05:31:42.788 --> 05:31:42.798 align:start position:0%
increase in phosphates each year it
 
05:31:45.110 --> 05:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
seems to coincide with the increased
 
05:31:47.030 --> 05:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
presence of the number of wake surf
 
05:31:49.788 --> 05:31:49.798 align:start position:0%
boats these boats are a detriment to
 
05:31:51.990 --> 05:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
water quality and recreational enjoyment
 
05:31:52.788 --> 05:31:52.798 align:start position:0%
on the
 
05:31:55.628 --> 05:31:55.638 align:start position:0%
pond I feel bad for the poor loons
 
05:31:59.070 --> 05:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:02.390 --> 05:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
shoreline thank you any questions by
 
05:32:05.110 --> 05:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:05.120 --> 05:32:06.628 align:start position:0%
 
committee

05:32:06.628 --> 05:32:06.638 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:32:09.390 --> 05:32:09.400 align:start position:0%
see representative Derby for our
 
05:32:12.430 --> 05:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
05:32:14.430 --> 05:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question with respect to
 
05:32:16.548 --> 05:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
kobitz Pond I don't have the exact size
 
05:32:18.788 --> 05:32:18.798 align:start position:0%
in front of me but I bet it's about 450
 
05:32:20.910 --> 05:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
acres 400 Acres something like that I'm
 
05:32:22.670 --> 05:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
wondering if you've seen any natural
 
05:32:25.910 --> 05:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
waves that are 4 feet high natural wind
 
05:32:28.830 --> 05:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
driven waves so it is uh com it is made
 
05:32:33.310 --> 05:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
up of two t two bodies of uh it's kind
 
05:32:35.910 --> 05:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
of in a figure eight I think the total
 
05:32:38.990 --> 05:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
acreage is a little over 300 acres so
 
05:32:42.150 --> 05:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
the larger Pond uh area is around 200
 
05:32:47.230 --> 05:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
Acres I have not seen 4ot waves uh other
 
05:32:50.350 --> 05:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
than uh you know the the waves that I
 
05:32:53.150 --> 05:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
see uh perhaps are three feet high
 
05:32:55.948 --> 05:32:55.958 align:start position:0%
coming off the back of the the stern of
 
05:32:58.948 --> 05:32:58.958 align:start position:0%

submitted over almost 1,700 folks have
 
05:34:07.230 --> 05:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
signed up in opposition to the bill what
 
05:34:08.868 --> 05:34:08.878 align:start position:0%
I did say I would do I had two speakers
 
05:34:10.070 --> 05:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
that were planning to come today that
 
05:34:12.230 --> 05:34:12.240 align:start position:0%

from he's a resident of sunap he is a
 
05:34:24.830 --> 05:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
combat veteran and a Bronze Star Award
 
05:34:27.030 --> 05:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
recipient for Valor and a former
 
05:34:29.708 --> 05:34:29.718 align:start position:0%
commander of the Navy SEAL Team too he
 
05:34:32.590 --> 05:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
is is a big supporter of wake surfing he
 
05:34:36.310 --> 05:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
has found that in his um duties he has
 
05:34:38.390 --> 05:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
had injuries and he finds it is helpful
 
05:34:40.788 --> 05:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
to his mental and physical health he is
 
05:34:43.230 --> 05:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
asking for the committee not to pass
 
05:34:46.230 --> 05:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
this bill um he has also has concerns
 
05:34:48.470 --> 05:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
about kind of infra infringing on
 
05:34:50.150 --> 05:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
people's freedoms that he has spent his
 
05:34:52.110 --> 05:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
career fighting for and he's also
 
05:34:54.868 --> 05:34:54.878 align:start position:0%
concerned about pushing wake surfing to
 
05:34:56.190 --> 05:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
the middle of a lake where there'll be
 
05:34:59.110 --> 05:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
more possibility for risks and injury
 
05:35:00.788 --> 05:35:00.798 align:start position:0%
the second set of testimony is from
 
05:35:03.270 --> 05:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
Steven Raymond he is a n Hampshire
 
05:35:05.670 --> 05:35:05.680 align:start position:0%

the big engineering firms in Manchester
 
05:35:13.708 --> 05:35:13.718 align:start position:0%
um he wished he could have been here
 
05:35:16.110 --> 05:35:16.120 align:start position:0%
today but his work takes him he focuses
 
05:35:18.590 --> 05:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
on remediation and restoration of
 
05:35:20.750 --> 05:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
wetlands and shorelines from New
 
05:35:22.990 --> 05:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to across the country he
 
05:35:25.270 --> 05:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
speaks specifically in his testimony
 
05:35:27.070 --> 05:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
about the environment and what causes
 
05:35:30.270 --> 05:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
Shoreline um erosion and BAS basically I
 
05:35:31.590 --> 05:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
think you'll read I hope you'll read his
 
05:35:33.190 --> 05:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
testimony because he's very clear that
 
05:35:35.350 --> 05:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
boat waves are not the concern when
 
05:35:36.788 --> 05:35:36.798 align:start position:0%
they're remediating and restoring
 
05:35:40.910 --> 05:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:44.990 --> 05:35:45.000 align:start position:0%

05:37:04.430 --> 05:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
ages we know that it's a fun way to
 
05:37:07.110 --> 05:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
enjoy our Lakes we know that it supports
 
05:37:11.150 --> 05:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
business we know that jobs rely on it we
 
05:37:13.270 --> 05:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
have supporters that enjoy wake Sports
 
05:37:15.470 --> 05:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
my family enjoys wake
 
05:37:18.030 --> 05:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
Sports we know that boating in general
 
05:37:20.670 --> 05:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
is good for our
 
05:37:23.350 --> 05:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
families and drives their economy we
 
05:37:25.750 --> 05:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
also know that clean and healthy lakes
 
05:37:27.868 --> 05:37:27.878 align:start position:0%
in general provide families residents
 
05:37:29.750 --> 05:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
and visitors overall throughout New
 
05:37:32.548 --> 05:37:32.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire even more in terms of
 
05:37:35.030 --> 05:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
enjoyment and support to our economy
 
05:37:37.628 --> 05:37:37.638 align:start position:0%
than boating alone yes boating brings in
 
05:37:40.628 --> 05:37:40.638 align:start position:0%
a great deal of to our estate wake
 
05:37:43.310 --> 05:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
Sports brings in some but overall at the
 
05:37:45.150 --> 05:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
end of the day it's clean and healthy
 
05:37:47.628 --> 05:37:47.638 align:start position:0%
lakes that are driving um our
 
05:37:49.910 --> 05:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
tourism-driven economy and providing a
 
05:37:53.270 --> 05:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
myriad of opportunities for our families
 
05:37:56.150 --> 05:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
our citizens and our
 
05:37:58.390 --> 05:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
visitors over the years New Hampshire
 
05:38:00.548 --> 05:38:00.558 align:start position:0%
Lakes has been involved in economic
 
05:38:02.708 --> 05:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
studies that show that people will
 
05:38:06.070 --> 05:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
choose to stop visiting our state if
 
05:38:09.150 --> 05:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
they if they determine or feel that our
 
05:38:10.990 --> 05:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
Lakes are being degraded that our Lakes
 
05:38:13.788 --> 05:38:13.798 align:start position:0%
are becoming unhealthy our economic
 
05:38:15.910 --> 05:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
Studies have shown that jobs will be
 
05:38:19.230 --> 05:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
lost property values will go down so
 
05:38:21.788 --> 05:38:21.798 align:start position:0%
clean and healthy Lakes are very very
 
05:38:23.670 --> 05:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
important to the
 
05:38:26.868 --> 05:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
economy so I have some good news
 
05:38:29.150 --> 05:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
experience and science has shown us that
 
05:38:31.310 --> 05:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
when conducted far from Shore and in
 
05:38:33.948 --> 05:38:33.958 align:start position:0%
deep water wake Sports can have minimal
 
05:38:36.788 --> 05:38:36.798 align:start position:0%
impacts on our health of our
 
05:38:39.150 --> 05:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
Lakes unfortunately in what you've heard
 
05:38:41.468 --> 05:38:41.478 align:start position:0%
from many today when wake sports are
 
05:38:43.670 --> 05:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
conducted too close to Shore and too
 
05:38:46.750 --> 05:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
shallow of water inappropriate places
 
05:38:49.430 --> 05:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
they are going to impact uh the health
 
05:38:52.708 --> 05:38:52.718 align:start position:0%
the the shoreline the lake Bottom
 
05:38:54.990 --> 05:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
endangering L health and causing other
 
05:38:58.110 --> 05:38:58.120 align:start position:0%
sorts of issues to for other forms of
 
05:39:02.030 --> 05:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
recreation and for property and property
 
05:39:06.150 --> 05:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
damage you have heard a 500t buffer from
 
05:39:08.150 --> 05:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
the shoreline and a 20 foot depth
 
05:39:10.990 --> 05:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
minimum is supported by many studies you
 
05:39:14.910 --> 05:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
have heard a lot today about a uh 200
 
05:39:17.070 --> 05:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
foot setback as proposed in at Senate
 
05:39:21.030 --> 05:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 431 this 200 foot setback to our
 
05:39:23.468 --> 05:39:23.478 align:start position:0%
understanding is based on one study one
 
05:39:26.548 --> 05:39:26.558 align:start position:0%
study in which the authors admitted that
 
05:39:28.390 --> 05:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
um they did mathematical models that
 
05:39:31.350 --> 05:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
were valid at one 100 ft from Shore but
 
05:39:34.510 --> 05:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
the authors indicated that the model
 
05:39:36.910 --> 05:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
could not be extrapolated to 200 ft
 
05:39:39.750 --> 05:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
therefore rendering the the outcome of
 
05:39:42.670 --> 05:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
that study uh potentially not credible
 
05:39:44.390 --> 05:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
so we do not support or believe that
 
05:39:47.350 --> 05:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
that 200 foot study is is something
 
05:39:49.030 --> 05:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's scientifically
 
05:39:52.350 --> 05:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
credible there's a growing wave of um
 
05:39:55.030 --> 05:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
thinking throughout the country that
 
05:39:58.910 --> 05:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
this sport um requires some additional
 
05:40:03.190 --> 05:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
setback fact you may be aware that on
 
05:40:05.350 --> 05:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
February 14th of this year Vermont the
 
05:40:07.510 --> 05:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
state of Vermont passed a wake Sports
 
05:40:09.788 --> 05:40:09.798 align:start position:0%
rule very similar to this rule but
 
05:40:12.190 --> 05:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
actually more more protective in that it
 
05:40:14.590 --> 05:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
also deals with aquatic invasive species
 
05:40:17.590 --> 05:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
prevention and spread um the state of
 
05:40:21.030 --> 05:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
Michigan just initiated um very similar
 
05:40:24.310 --> 05:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
legislation to this on February 28th
 
05:40:26.948 --> 05:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
establishing a wake Sport Zone of 500 ft
 
05:40:30.030 --> 05:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
20t depth we are not alone
 
05:40:32.110 --> 05:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
in throughout the country thinking that
 
05:40:35.070 --> 05:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
this particular activity needs a little
 
05:40:36.910 --> 05:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
bit more consideration for what it's
 
05:40:39.150 --> 05:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
doing to the health of our
 
05:40:41.510 --> 05:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
Waters there's one really particular
 
05:40:43.590 --> 05:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
point I wanted to bring up today we've
 
05:40:46.070 --> 05:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
taugh a lot talked a lot about economics
 
05:40:48.150 --> 05:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
here today and I wanted to point out and
 
05:40:50.910 --> 05:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
I've shared with you in my handout the
 
05:40:54.510 --> 05:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
state of Vermont did a really extensive
 
05:40:58.670 --> 05:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
2year review of the proposed law um in
 
05:41:01.510 --> 05:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
that state it was originally a th000 ft
 
05:41:03.948 --> 05:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
60 Acres of contiguous area in the state
 
05:41:05.990 --> 05:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
of Vermont two different state agencies
 
05:41:08.948 --> 05:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
there after several years of
 
05:41:11.510 --> 05:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
consideration um and after two economic
 
05:41:14.310 --> 05:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
analysis to determine that 500 ft there
 
05:41:16.868 --> 05:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
was appropriate I found their economic
 
05:41:19.830 --> 05:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
analysis particularly interesting they
 
05:41:23.190 --> 05:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
conducted two scenarios with and without
 
05:41:25.830 --> 05:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
the regulation in Vermont 10 years into
 
05:41:28.030 --> 05:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
the future so they looked at if this
 
05:41:32.030 --> 05:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
500t rule 20ft depth uh 50 contiguous
 
05:41:35.628 --> 05:41:35.638 align:start position:0%
area rule was put into effect or wasn't
 
05:41:37.628 --> 05:41:37.638 align:start position:0%
put into effect what would the outcome
 
05:41:39.990 --> 05:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
be on the E economy economy for the next
 
05:41:44.590 --> 05:41:44.600 align:start position:0%
10 years so what that study found is
 
05:41:47.708 --> 05:41:47.718 align:start position:0%
that the analys showed that the economic
 
05:41:50.468 --> 05:41:50.478 align:start position:0%
benefit of the Wake Sports regulation
 
05:41:54.270 --> 05:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
outweighs the costs by 10 to one the
 
05:41:57.830 --> 05:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
annual benefits estimated at 93 million
 
05:42:00.948 --> 05:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
include the reservation of water quality
 
05:42:03.430 --> 05:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
the the continuation of affordable
 
05:42:06.788 --> 05:42:06.798 align:start position:0%
smallscale recreational activities on
 
05:42:08.948 --> 05:42:08.958 align:start position:0%
the that form the core of Vermont's
 
05:42:11.350 --> 05:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
water-based Recreation and the
 
05:42:13.788 --> 05:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
protection of the tourist economy that
 
05:42:16.590 --> 05:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
depends on clean and healthy
 
05:42:19.350 --> 05:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
lakes that study concluded that the
 
05:42:22.150 --> 05:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
potential annual costs of implementing
 
05:42:26.830 --> 05:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
the rule was 8 million and based on and
 
05:42:28.430 --> 05:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
based on the limitations that the role
 
05:42:30.468 --> 05:42:30.478 align:start position:0%
would place on the growth of the wakes
 
05:42:32.868 --> 05:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
boat industry so again the Vermont
 
05:42:35.430 --> 05:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
economic analysis said implementing the
 
05:42:39.190 --> 05:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
rule um Ben had economic benefits 10 to
 
05:42:41.750 --> 05:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
one I would suggest
 
05:42:45.468 --> 05:42:45.478 align:start position:0%
that the implementation of a lake
 
05:42:47.510 --> 05:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
friendly wake Sports rule might also
 
05:42:49.670 --> 05:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
have a similar economic effect here in
 
05:42:52.830 --> 05:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire representative L earlier
 
05:42:54.590 --> 05:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
asked you know what is the sensus how
 
05:42:56.510 --> 05:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
many wake sport how many wake boats are
 
05:42:58.270 --> 05:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire's Lakes I certainly
 
05:43:00.030 --> 05:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
don't have that answer
 
05:43:01.670 --> 05:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
but I can provide you some sort of
 
05:43:04.628 --> 05:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
anecdotal data many of you may know that
 
05:43:07.510 --> 05:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes every summer um
 
05:43:09.468 --> 05:43:09.478 align:start position:0%
implements the lake host program this is
 
05:43:11.830 --> 05:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
a courtesy boat inspection program that
 
05:43:14.510 --> 05:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
we provide to boter throughout the state
 
05:43:16.628 --> 05:43:16.638 align:start position:0%
at 100 of the most highly used boat
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
ramps in the state generally speaking
 
05:43:21.670 --> 05:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
every year we interact and teach and
 
05:43:25.070 --> 05:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
help um anywhere from 90 to 100,000
 
05:43:27.230 --> 05:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
voters per year um throughout our
 
05:43:30.510 --> 05:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
history we've in interacted with um just
 
05:43:33.070 --> 05:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
under 2 million boter what I can tell
 
05:43:35.910 --> 05:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
you is whenever we interact with a Boer
 
05:43:37.628 --> 05:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
we are going to record what kind of
 
05:43:41.468 --> 05:43:41.478 align:start position:0%
craft they're in so what kind of boat so
 
05:43:43.868 --> 05:43:43.878 align:start position:0%
um last year and actually I did this
 
05:43:47.390 --> 05:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
over the past five years so at from 2000
 
05:43:50.628 --> 05:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
to last year um generally speaking of
 
05:43:54.708 --> 05:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
those let's Round Up to 100,000 about 3
 
05:43:57.468 --> 05:43:57.478 align:start position:0%
to 5% of the boats that we come in
 
05:43:59.628 --> 05:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
contact voters that we come in contact
 
05:44:03.110 --> 05:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
with have a ballast boat um the rest of
 
05:44:05.270 --> 05:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
them are all other types of motorboats
 
05:44:07.948 --> 05:44:07.958 align:start position:0%
and paddlecraft so my point in bringing
 
05:44:10.628 --> 05:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
this up to you is generally speaking
 
05:44:13.468 --> 05:44:13.478 align:start position:0%
this wake Sports ballast boats are
 
05:44:16.548 --> 05:44:16.558 align:start position:0%
fairly small percentage of the
 
05:44:18.990 --> 05:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
recreational activity that we are seeing
 
05:44:22.430 --> 05:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
going from Lake to Lake to Lake um and
 
05:44:24.510 --> 05:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
we feel that you know all that what
 
05:44:26.628 --> 05:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
you've heard from the supporters today
 
05:44:29.310 --> 05:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
this relatively small form you know not
 
05:44:31.430 --> 05:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
as small form of recuperation on our
 
05:44:33.310 --> 05:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
Lakes is creating a
 
05:44:36.468 --> 05:44:36.478 align:start position:0%
disproportionately large impact um you
 
05:44:39.590 --> 05:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
know creating um problems for other
 
05:44:42.110 --> 05:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
forms of recreation to Coexist on the
 
05:44:45.270 --> 05:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
lake so I suggest that um it is
 
05:44:46.868 --> 05:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
appropriate and I hope that you find it
 
05:44:50.030 --> 05:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable to to uh support this bill
 
05:44:52.590 --> 05:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be a better balance
 
05:44:55.070 --> 05:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
and um again we are supportive of the
 
05:44:58.310 --> 05:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
500t 20ft depth as it is based in
 
05:44:59.628 --> 05:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
credible sign
 
05:45:01.468 --> 05:45:01.478 align:start position:0%
so I thank you for that opportunity and
 
05:45:03.670 --> 05:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
I uh to speak and we'll be happy to
 
05:45:08.070 --> 05:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:11.190 --> 05:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
questions Mr chair Mr
 
05:45:14.390 --> 05:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
chair representative rung for a question
 
05:45:16.350 --> 05:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and and thank you Mr
 
05:45:19.310 --> 05:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
lro for your testimony I have your your
 
05:45:21.350 --> 05:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
written packet that was distributed and
 
05:45:23.788 --> 05:45:23.798 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate um the objective
 
05:45:25.910 --> 05:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
analysis because this is a very
 
05:45:28.190 --> 05:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
emotional issue and I see that in
 
05:45:30.150 --> 05:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
Vermont that they had an economic
 
05:45:34.430 --> 05:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
analysis the Michigan report is is seems
 
05:45:36.910 --> 05:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
strictly um environmental but you
 
05:45:38.788 --> 05:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier in your testimony
 
05:45:40.350 --> 05:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
there question yeah it's coming right
 
05:45:42.990 --> 05:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
now Mr chair thank you um you mentioned
 
05:45:45.230 --> 05:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
earlier in your testimony about that you
 
05:45:47.390 --> 05:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
had done an economic study or New
 
05:45:50.590 --> 05:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right um do you have that I
 
05:45:51.788 --> 05:45:51.798 align:start position:0%
don't have that here today I can
 
05:45:53.788 --> 05:45:53.798 align:start position:0%
certainly get that to you all um it's
 
05:45:55.868 --> 05:45:55.878 align:start position:0%
it's a little dated but it's still I
 
05:45:59.310 --> 05:45:59.320 align:start position:0%
think it's can show you the different um
 
05:46:01.830 --> 05:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
relative proportions of of uses and we
 
05:46:03.510 --> 05:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
can also update it in these today's
 
05:46:05.510 --> 05:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
dollars so yes thank you for that okay
 
05:46:05.520 --> 05:46:09.230 align:start position:0%
dollars so yes thank you for that okay
thank

05:46:09.230 --> 05:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:11.910 --> 05:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
you for a
 
05:46:14.510 --> 05:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair let me take
 
05:46:16.070 --> 05:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
this question thank you for answering
 
05:46:18.868 --> 05:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
this question um so I'm curious about
 
05:46:20.590 --> 05:46:20.600 align:start position:0%
the effects of erosion whether it's
 
05:46:24.548 --> 05:46:24.558 align:start position:0%
twoot 3ot 4ft waves I'm hearing uh o
 
05:46:26.590 --> 05:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
over and over again that these specific
 
05:46:29.468 --> 05:46:29.478 align:start position:0%
boats always are at 4T weight waves they
 
05:46:31.548 --> 05:46:31.558 align:start position:0%
only create 4ft waves or do they
 
05:46:35.030 --> 05:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
actually have different levels based on
 
05:46:37.110 --> 05:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
when they are you know whether they're
 
05:46:38.468 --> 05:46:38.478 align:start position:0%
doing the sport or whether there's
 
05:46:40.510 --> 05:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
cruising I'm assuming it's not always
 
05:46:43.030 --> 05:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
the one thing also can you talk about
 
05:46:44.990 --> 05:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
what the effects of erosion are whether
 
05:46:47.350 --> 05:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
it's one foot two foot or three foot
 
05:46:49.990 --> 05:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
wigs great question very technical
 
05:46:53.270 --> 05:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
question I will do my best um my
 
05:46:55.310 --> 05:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is that you know wake
 
05:46:57.230 --> 05:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
surfing you can control the size of of
 
05:46:59.708 --> 05:46:59.718 align:start position:0%
the wave so depending on um on you know
 
05:47:03.310 --> 05:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
how large you want it um I would say
 
05:47:05.910 --> 05:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
that the various studies you know
 
05:47:07.750 --> 05:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
summarized there's a bunch of studies
 
05:47:09.150 --> 05:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
out there and they all looked at sort of
 
05:47:11.468 --> 05:47:11.478 align:start position:0%
different aspects and and they all
 
05:47:13.390 --> 05:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
looked at you know different Siz waves
 
05:47:15.510 --> 05:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
so it's hard to give you an exact oh a
 
05:47:17.510 --> 05:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
three-foot wave causes this type of
 
05:47:20.310 --> 05:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
erosion because it also depends on the
 
05:47:22.350 --> 05:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
shoreline itself you know what the Shor
 
05:47:24.628 --> 05:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
if it's a Sandy Shoreline a Mucky
 
05:47:26.548 --> 05:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
Shoreline a rocky Shoreline it's really
 
05:47:28.510 --> 05:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
going to depend it's a great question
 
05:47:29.910 --> 05:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
and I really can't give you a more
 
05:47:32.110 --> 05:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
definitive answer than
 
05:47:34.190 --> 05:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
05:47:39.990 --> 05:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:43.350 --> 05:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
chair representative Darby for another
 
05:47:46.548 --> 05:47:46.558 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you Mr chair I
 
05:47:47.830 --> 05:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
know surprise
 
05:47:49.510 --> 05:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
surprise thank you for taking my
 
05:47:51.548 --> 05:47:51.558 align:start position:0%
question I'm
 
05:47:56.070 --> 05:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
stunned um so I understand that the um
 
05:47:57.910 --> 05:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know the the 200 foot setback maybe
 
05:47:59.310 --> 05:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
didn't have a Val
 
05:48:02.430 --> 05:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
um scientific basis it also didn't have
 
05:48:03.868 --> 05:48:03.878 align:start position:0%
um that the Senate bill that's been
 
05:48:07.110 --> 05:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
discussed numerous times doesn't have a
 
05:48:08.548 --> 05:48:08.558 align:start position:0%
depth comp
 
05:48:10.948 --> 05:48:10.958 align:start position:0%
component I'm wondering um if you can
 
05:48:12.830 --> 05:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
elaborate on why the depth component is
 
05:48:15.948 --> 05:48:15.958 align:start position:0%
so important um to this B great thank
 
05:48:17.190 --> 05:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative
 
05:48:20.350 --> 05:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
Darby we think that a 20 foot depth or a
 
05:48:23.110 --> 05:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
depth requirement um is is missing from
 
05:48:25.030 --> 05:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
the Wake responsibly and should be in it
 
05:48:26.670 --> 05:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
we also think that it's important for
 
05:48:29.590 --> 05:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
this bill um I will tell you and there
 
05:48:31.070 --> 05:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
are folks in this room can that can
 
05:48:32.990 --> 05:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
testify to this that there are lakes in
 
05:48:36.350 --> 05:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that um even at 500 feet
 
05:48:40.628 --> 05:48:40.638 align:start position:0%
from sure they're not 20 ft deep um and
 
05:48:43.230 --> 05:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
various Studies have shown that we find
 
05:48:45.830 --> 05:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
credible that uh you know the downward
 
05:48:47.270 --> 05:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned earlier the downward
 
05:48:49.990 --> 05:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
tipping um propeller can disturb
 
05:48:52.788 --> 05:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
sediment anywhere from 15 to 33 fet
 
05:48:54.230 --> 05:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
again you know no study is perfect and
 
05:48:55.548 --> 05:48:55.558 align:start position:0%
they're all kind of looking at this a
 
05:48:58.590 --> 05:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
little differently um but disturbing the
 
05:49:00.750 --> 05:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
sediment is going to whip up the
 
05:49:02.868 --> 05:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
phosphorus that is in the bottom of the
 
05:49:07.510 --> 05:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
lake um and be available uh for again um
 
05:49:10.830 --> 05:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
nut uh algae growth toxic cyanobacteria
 
05:49:13.708 --> 05:49:13.718 align:start position:0%
growth uh thank you for the
 
05:49:16.310 --> 05:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
question any additional questions by
 
05:49:18.230 --> 05:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
05:49:20.990 --> 05:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
05:49:23.110 --> 05:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
05:49:23.120 --> 05:49:24.868 align:start position:0%
much thank
you

05:49:24.868 --> 05:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:49:29.030 --> 05:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
something question I'm surprised
 
05:49:31.628 --> 05:49:31.638 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I'll take two this time
 
05:49:35.590 --> 05:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
from the opposition that that was the
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
support one have went so long uh the uh
 
05:49:44.910 --> 05:49:44.920 align:start position:0%

05:49:59.590 --> 05:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
okay sorry it was a high over here uh in
 
05:50:00.830 --> 05:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
an attempt to not keep us here till
 
05:50:03.110 --> 05:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
dinner I will be very short uh as was
 
05:50:06.548 --> 05:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
said my name is uh Ethan helier and I am
 
05:50:07.830 --> 05:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
the government Affairs manager for the
 
05:50:09.628 --> 05:50:09.638 align:start position:0%
water sports industry Association and
 
05:50:11.190 --> 05:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and members for
 
05:50:13.270 --> 05:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
having this hearing today I am here to
 
05:50:17.230 --> 05:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
voice my opposition to this bill um when
 
05:50:18.788 --> 05:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about the studies
 
05:50:21.510 --> 05:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
wsia is in favor of a 200 foot offset
 
05:50:23.310 --> 05:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
for water sports because it is a number
 
05:50:25.948 --> 05:50:25.958 align:start position:0%
that's rooted in peer-reviewed research
 
05:50:27.628 --> 05:50:27.638 align:start position:0%
Naval architect kotti Fay found that
 
05:50:29.590 --> 05:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
while wake surfing from 200 ft from
 
05:50:31.830 --> 05:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
Shore waves still may wash up on the
 
05:50:33.150 --> 05:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
shore these waves will not be carrying
 
05:50:35.750 --> 05:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
enough Force to degrade shorelines
 
05:50:37.070 --> 05:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
especially when you compare it to wind
 
05:50:39.070 --> 05:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
driven waves there's been also a lot of
 
05:50:41.270 --> 05:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
conversation about the Minnesota study
 
05:50:42.910 --> 05:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
something that I want to point out about
 
05:50:45.510 --> 05:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
the Min um something I want to point out
 
05:50:48.070 --> 05:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
about the University of Minnesota and St
 
05:50:50.590 --> 05:50:50.600 align:start position:0%
Anthony Falls lab study is that they
 
05:50:52.150 --> 05:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
found that shoreline erosion is driven
 
05:50:55.150 --> 05:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
mainly by wind generated wave energy the
 
05:50:57.510 --> 05:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
St uh Anthony Falls lab studying
 
05:50:59.390 --> 05:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
Nearshore sediment movement on the
 
05:51:01.670 --> 05:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
shorelines of 460 Lakes concluded that
 
05:51:04.030 --> 05:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
shoreline erosion is a result of wind
 
05:51:06.910 --> 05:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
driven waves with no mention of wake
 
05:51:09.390 --> 05:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
boats uh We've also talked a little bit
 
05:51:11.150 --> 05:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
about wake responsibly today which is
 
05:51:12.390 --> 05:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
something else that I want to you know
 
05:51:15.708 --> 05:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
expand on we work with all sorts of
 
05:51:17.110 --> 05:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
units of government whether it be at a
 
05:51:19.830 --> 05:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
state or a local level as far as you
 
05:51:22.510 --> 05:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
know getting these either in uh Boer
 
05:51:24.910 --> 05:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
education or just like here in the in
 
05:51:26.510 --> 05:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire where you
 
05:51:29.390 --> 05:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
renew your Boer Boer red registration
 
05:51:30.750 --> 05:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
you are greeted with the Wake
 
05:51:32.910 --> 05:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
responsibly tenants in there we also
 
05:51:34.990 --> 05:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
work with our dealers where we've given
 
05:51:37.670 --> 05:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
them tens of thousands of these tags
 
05:51:40.430 --> 05:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
which all go in new boats um you know
 
05:51:42.070 --> 05:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
again focusing on the three things that
 
05:51:44.310 --> 05:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
we promote staying 200 ft from Shore
 
05:51:45.868 --> 05:51:45.878 align:start position:0%
keeping music at a reasonable level and
 
05:51:47.990 --> 05:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
utilizing the whole lake so the Boating
 
05:51:50.468 --> 05:51:50.478 align:start position:0%
industry is uh committed to safety and
 
05:51:52.628 --> 05:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
education um and with that I just ask
 
05:51:54.030 --> 05:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
you to oppose this bill and I'll take
 
05:51:54.040 --> 05:51:54.948 align:start position:0%
you to oppose this bill and I'll take
any

05:51:54.948 --> 05:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:51:57.270 --> 05:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
questions Mr
 
05:51:57.280 --> 05:51:59.670 align:start position:0%
questions Mr
chair

05:51:59.670 --> 05:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:52:02.628 --> 05:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
representative Darby for question thank
 
05:52:04.310 --> 05:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
you so much Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:52:06.670 --> 05:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'd like to confirm
 
05:52:08.548 --> 05:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
that the study that you're referring to
 
05:52:10.628 --> 05:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
the St Anthony Falls laboratory is
 
05:52:12.510 --> 05:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
quantifying wave energy on Minnesota
 
05:52:15.030 --> 05:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
lakes because that boat that study does
 
05:52:18.350 --> 05:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
not actually find as a result that that
 
05:52:20.990 --> 05:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
waves are a result that erosion is a
 
05:52:23.270 --> 05:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
result of wind driven waves that study
 
05:52:28.750 --> 05:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
is about replanting um uh aquatic uh
 
05:52:31.468 --> 05:52:31.478 align:start position:0%
aquatic vegetation for fish habitat
 
05:52:33.350 --> 05:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's what that study finds what is the
 
05:52:34.750 --> 05:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
question so I'd like to make sure that
 
05:52:36.390 --> 05:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding that we're talking
 
05:52:38.070 --> 05:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
about the same study quantifying wave
 
05:52:41.150 --> 05:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
energy on Minnesota lakes chairman and
 
05:52:42.670 --> 05:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
members yeah they've done two studies
 
05:52:44.350 --> 05:52:44.360 align:start position:0%
one of them is where they looked or they
 
05:52:46.788 --> 05:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
researched on 460 lakes in the state of
 
05:52:49.270 --> 05:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
Minnesota and found that wind is the
 
05:52:51.468 --> 05:52:51.478 align:start position:0%
main cause of shoreline erosion and then
 
05:52:53.270 --> 05:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
the other one where they actually looked
 
05:52:56.190 --> 05:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
at uh wake boats versus other boats you
 
05:52:58.670 --> 05:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
know again they found that wind is the
 
05:53:00.750 --> 05:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
main driver towards Shoreland erosion
 
05:53:02.708 --> 05:53:02.718 align:start position:0%
and they studied wake energy but they
 
05:53:05.430 --> 05:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
did not study wake Energy's impact on
 
05:53:09.350 --> 05:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:12.548 --> 05:53:12.558 align:start position:0%
helpful Mr chair any other questions by
 
05:53:15.150 --> 05:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee yes Mr chair
 
05:53:17.350 --> 05:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um you mentioned earlier in
 
05:53:19.468 --> 05:53:19.478 align:start position:0%
your testimony about the peer reviewed
 
05:53:21.948 --> 05:53:21.958 align:start position:0%
studies that show that 200 feed is an
 
05:53:24.230 --> 05:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
adequate distance could you provide us a
 
05:53:27.310 --> 05:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
list of those studies do you have them
 
05:53:29.990 --> 05:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
the name of the study I want to get the
 
05:53:32.788 --> 05:53:32.798 align:start position:0%
correct name it's the one that U was
 
05:53:38.548 --> 05:53:38.558 align:start position:0%
done by uh Endicott Fay um I don't have
 
05:53:40.708 --> 05:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
the exact title of the study in front of
 
05:53:42.948 --> 05:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
me but I have it I can get it for you
 
05:53:44.350 --> 05:53:44.360 align:start position:0%
would you just email the committee with
 
05:53:47.310 --> 05:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
it be great thank you I have an idea of
 
05:53:48.350 --> 05:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
what the title is I just don't want to
 
05:53:51.150 --> 05:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
get it wrong but I can share it with you
 
05:53:53.070 --> 05:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
any other members of the committee who
 
05:53:55.590 --> 05:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:58.510 --> 05:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
question no one else thank you you very

much thank
 
05:54:04.468 --> 05:54:04.478 align:start position:0%
you chair calls well first to see if he
 
05:54:09.990 --> 05:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:13.590 --> 05:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
Coker I guess he did not come
 
05:54:17.628 --> 05:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
back he got out way out he got out I
 
05:54:19.628 --> 05:54:19.638 align:start position:0%
guess he couldn't take it couldn't take
 
05:54:24.310 --> 05:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
it all right uh Mr Barker uh Jason
 
05:54:27.070 --> 05:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
Barker uh for three
 
05:54:27.080 --> 05:54:32.548 align:start position:0%
Barker uh for three
minutes

05:54:32.548 --> 05:54:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:34.468 --> 05:54:34.478 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon thank you Mr chairman
 
05:54:36.628 --> 05:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
committee for listening to me uh my name
 
05:54:37.990 --> 05:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
is Jason
 
05:54:41.990 --> 05:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
Barker um I'm speaking against HB 1390
 
05:54:44.990 --> 05:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
because important to me my wife my 8 and
 
05:54:48.030 --> 05:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
10 15year old children uh my family
 
05:54:49.390 --> 05:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
first purchased property in East
 
05:54:52.230 --> 05:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
Wakefield on Province Lake in 1978 and
 
05:54:54.590 --> 05:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
I've been there my whole life I've been
 
05:54:56.030 --> 05:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
doing Water Sports on the lake since
 
05:54:58.230 --> 05:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
1990 when my father first purchased just
 
05:55:00.910 --> 05:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
our first family boat in 1996 I learned
 
05:55:03.990 --> 05:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
to wakeboard and still do it to this day
 
05:55:05.750 --> 05:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
I now have three kids and a wife who all
 
05:55:08.708 --> 05:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
also wakeboard and wake surf in the last
 
05:55:10.670 --> 05:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
10 to 15 years wake surfing has become
 
05:55:13.590 --> 05:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
the big thing for all ages risk of
 
05:55:16.110 --> 05:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
injury at 10 mph is considerably lower
 
05:55:19.750 --> 05:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
than doing 20 mph or faster with most
 
05:55:22.270 --> 05:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
other water sports had my kids on boards
 
05:55:24.030 --> 05:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
with me before they could do it alone by
 
05:55:26.070 --> 05:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
themselves and now all of us do this as
 
05:55:28.548 --> 05:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
a family activity we spent hours upon
 
05:55:30.948 --> 05:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
hours on the lake doing all of these
 
05:55:32.548 --> 05:55:32.558 align:start position:0%
getting outside and enjoying the fresh
 
05:55:35.110 --> 05:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
air instead of sitting inside this bill
 
05:55:36.788 --> 05:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
passes it will take the way take away
 
05:55:38.190 --> 05:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
the weake surfing and the weight
 
05:55:40.910 --> 05:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
boarding will be next I'm confused as to
 
05:55:42.868 --> 05:55:42.878 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this build they talk
 
05:55:44.350 --> 05:55:44.360 align:start position:0%
about creating weights that damage
 
05:55:46.750 --> 05:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
Shoreline capsize canoes you can't see
 
05:55:49.070 --> 05:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
over the bow and it creates cyano
 
05:55:51.310 --> 05:55:51.320 align:start position:0%
bacteria those first three have nothing
 
05:55:53.190 --> 05:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
to do with a lake that's under 20 ft
 
05:55:55.150 --> 05:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
deep which this law makes a point to
 
05:55:57.590 --> 05:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
State all those can happen on any siiz
 
05:55:57.600 --> 05:56:00.910 align:start position:0%
State all those can happen on any siiz
Lake

05:56:00.910 --> 05:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
as this lak St as this law states I
 
05:56:05.670 --> 05:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
can't use a surfboard wakeboard Hydro
 
05:56:07.910 --> 05:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
foil or similar device to ride on or in
 
05:56:09.788 --> 05:56:09.798 align:start position:0%
the Wake directly behind a wake booat
 
05:56:11.948 --> 05:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
with or without a rope including wake
 
05:56:14.030 --> 05:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
surfing it doesn't say that I can't go
 
05:56:16.030 --> 05:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
out in a wake boat fill the ballast bags
 
05:56:17.788 --> 05:56:17.798 align:start position:0%
and cruise around the lake creating the
 
05:56:19.868 --> 05:56:19.878 align:start position:0%
same wake whether someone is behind the
 
05:56:22.948 --> 05:56:22.958 align:start position:0%
boat or not before completely outlying
 
05:56:24.910 --> 05:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
an activity wondering what else could be
 
05:56:26.510 --> 05:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
done to minimize the harmful effects
 
05:56:28.510 --> 05:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
they claim wake surfing has caused in
 
05:56:30.548 --> 05:56:30.558 align:start position:0%
patrolling the Lakes better so that
 
05:56:31.868 --> 05:56:31.878 align:start position:0%
people are actually keeping their card
 
05:56:34.990 --> 05:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
150 ft away from Shoreline and boats
 
05:56:35.000 --> 05:56:36.468 align:start position:0%
150 ft away from Shoreline and boats
using

05:56:36.468 --> 05:56:36.478 align:start position:0%
using
 
05:56:38.310 --> 05:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
fertilizers that don't contain
 
05:56:40.030 --> 05:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
phosphorus and nitrogen and having
 
05:56:41.548 --> 05:56:41.558 align:start position:0%
waterfront properties putting in rain
 
05:56:43.830 --> 05:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
barrels to catch runoff trying to limit
 
05:56:45.390 --> 05:56:45.400 align:start position:0%
cyano bacteria
 
05:56:47.670 --> 05:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
balloons thank you for listening please
 
05:56:51.110 --> 05:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
oppose Bill House Bill
 
05:56:54.310 --> 05:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
1390 thank you is there a question from
 
05:56:56.788 --> 05:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
05:57:00.190 --> 05:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
committee representative Donley thank
 
05:57:01.350 --> 05:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
05:57:04.390 --> 05:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
question as a you a user of a wake boat
 
05:57:06.510 --> 05:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
Y how frequently do you use your wake
 
05:57:09.190 --> 05:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
Boo and is creating a 4 foot wave is it
 
05:57:10.948 --> 05:57:10.958 align:start position:0%
every time you go out when does that
 
05:57:12.468 --> 05:57:12.478 align:start position:0%
happen so that question that you asked
 
05:57:14.350 --> 05:57:14.360 align:start position:0%
before no I can go out and that if I'm
 
05:57:16.110 --> 05:57:16.120 align:start position:0%
going to wake surf yes you're going to
 
05:57:17.948 --> 05:57:17.958 align:start position:0%
look for a bigger wake now somebody
 
05:57:20.190 --> 05:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
that's a beginner is not looking for a 4
 
05:57:22.868 --> 05:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
foot wake um but we can take that boat
 
05:57:25.430 --> 05:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
out I ski behind that boat which I don't
 
05:57:27.070 --> 05:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
want I tube behind that boat which I
 
05:57:28.628 --> 05:57:28.638 align:start position:0%
don't want to wake
 
05:57:31.230 --> 05:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
um so yeah they're they're going after
 
05:57:33.670 --> 05:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
the person that's directly behind it w
 
05:57:35.548 --> 05:57:35.558 align:start position:0%
surfing but I can use that boat and not
 
05:57:39.590 --> 05:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
create a four 4ot wake um and I guess I
 
05:57:41.430 --> 05:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
can create the 4-ot Wake with nobody
 
05:57:43.430 --> 05:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
behind me we go
 
05:57:47.628 --> 05:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
out if for there's 15 weekends in a
 
05:57:50.070 --> 05:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
summer um we put the boat in Memorial
 
05:57:51.468 --> 05:57:51.478 align:start position:0%
Day weekend we take it out Labor Day
 
05:57:54.310 --> 05:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
weekend so and we maybe on a good summer
 
05:57:57.070 --> 05:57:57.080 align:start position:0%
we get out twice a day on Saturday and
 
05:58:01.270 --> 05:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:03.590 --> 05:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
weekend any other members of the
 
05:58:06.788 --> 05:58:06.798 align:start position:0%
committee have a question seeing none
 
05:58:08.548 --> 05:58:08.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very

Association good afternoon chair and
 
05:58:23.670 --> 05:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
members of the house uh my name is Dr
 
05:58:25.868 --> 05:58:25.878 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth Harper I'm executive director
 
05:58:28.150 --> 05:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
of the lake cipe protective Association
 
05:58:32.310 --> 05:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
ation um and before joining lspa about 2
 
05:58:34.590 --> 05:58:34.600 align:start position:0%
years ago um I was an environmental
 
05:58:36.708 --> 05:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
science Professor for seven years at New
 
05:58:39.230 --> 05:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
England college and prior to that I was
 
05:58:41.990 --> 05:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
a professor of fisheries and wildlife uh
 
05:58:44.910 --> 05:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
at Paul Smith college in the ader andax
 
05:58:46.390 --> 05:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
um so I'd like to speak to some of the
 
05:58:46.400 --> 05:58:48.590 align:start position:0%
um so I'd like to speak to some of the
science

05:58:48.590 --> 05:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
science
 
05:58:51.510 --> 05:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
today um I'm here today to ask you to
 
05:58:53.190 --> 05:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
support HB
 
05:58:55.750 --> 05:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
1390 um New Hampshire's Lakes are vital
 
05:58:58.270 --> 05:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
to our economy they're vital to economy
 
05:59:00.430 --> 05:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
when they're clean when they support
 
05:59:02.468 --> 05:59:02.478 align:start position:0%
healthy fish populations and when
 
05:59:04.708 --> 05:59:04.718 align:start position:0%
they're beneficial for
 
05:59:06.910 --> 05:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
recreation they're natural resources
 
05:59:08.830 --> 05:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
that belong to all of us and that must
 
05:59:11.510 --> 05:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
be managed carefully to ensure that
 
05:59:13.670 --> 05:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
they're not unnecessarily
 
05:59:16.350 --> 05:59:16.360 align:start position:0%
degraded we all collectively have a
 
05:59:18.910 --> 05:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility to use these resources in
 
05:59:21.190 --> 05:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
a way that allows future generations to
 
05:59:24.590 --> 05:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
experience our Lakes as we do today wake
 
05:59:27.670 --> 05:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
Sports can be conducted responsibly in w
 
05:59:29.430 --> 05:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
ways that minimize impacts to water
 
05:59:31.270 --> 05:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
quality and Lake
 
05:59:33.788 --> 05:59:33.798 align:start position:0%
ecosystems but when wake surfing takes
 
05:59:35.948 --> 05:59:35.958 align:start position:0%
place too close to the Shoreline or in
 
05:59:38.830 --> 05:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
Shallow Waters the impacts of the high
 
05:59:42.628 --> 05:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
intensity waves and the propeller wash
 
05:59:45.110 --> 05:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
um can be intense and they include
 
05:59:47.750 --> 05:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
impacts including shoreline erosion
 
05:59:50.948 --> 05:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
degration uh degradation of fish habitat
 
05:59:53.750 --> 05:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
uprooting of aquatic plants suspension
 
05:59:56.788 --> 05:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
of sediment reduction of water quality
 
05:59:59.310 --> 05:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
and release of phosphorous which we know
 
06:00:02.590 --> 06:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
leads to toxic cyanobacteria blooms
 
06:00:05.708 --> 06:00:05.718 align:start position:0%
those impacts degrade the value of the
 
06:00:07.590 --> 06:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
lakes that are important to all of us
 
06:00:08.830 --> 06:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
and to our
 
06:00:11.310 --> 06:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
economy and what I want you to take home
 
06:00:13.990 --> 06:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
today is the fact that these impacts can
 
06:00:17.190 --> 06:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
have devastating long-term consequences
 
06:00:18.948 --> 06:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
those consequences are entirely
 
06:00:21.548 --> 06:00:21.558 align:start position:0%
avoidable and that's what this legis
 
06:00:24.510 --> 06:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
legislation is seeking to do is avoiding
 
06:00:28.030 --> 06:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
those unnecessary costs um to our
 
06:00:31.150 --> 06:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
economy um and to the resources that we
 
06:00:35.310 --> 06:00:35.320 align:start position:0%
all hold dear HB 1390 proposes
 
06:00:37.750 --> 06:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable limitations on Wake sports
 
06:00:39.510 --> 06:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
that are based on sound
 
06:00:41.948 --> 06:00:41.958 align:start position:0%
science the recommendation to limit wake
 
06:00:44.030 --> 06:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
Sports to areas 500 feet from the
 
06:00:47.830 --> 06:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
shorelines and depths of 20 ft on bodies
 
06:00:50.310 --> 06:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
of water at least 50 acres have been
 
06:00:51.948 --> 06:00:51.958 align:start position:0%
supported by Michigan's Department of
 
06:00:54.190 --> 06:00:54.200 align:start position:0%

Department of Environmental Conservation
 
06:00:59.590 --> 06:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
and by numerous peer-reviewed scientific
 
06:01:02.390 --> 06:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
studies the best science is summarized
 
06:01:04.910 --> 06:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
well in a thorough literature review of
 
06:01:07.868 --> 06:01:07.878 align:start position:0%
over 50 sources that were synthesized by
 
06:01:09.350 --> 06:01:09.360 align:start position:0%

06:01:12.510 --> 06:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
Natural Resources in July
 
06:01:15.788 --> 06:01:15.798 align:start position:0%
2023 the recommendations are clear from
 
06:01:19.468 --> 06:01:19.478 align:start position:0%
that study that that 500 ft distance is
 
06:01:22.910 --> 06:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
important and that the depth
 
06:01:25.070 --> 06:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
matters there's a study that keeps
 
06:01:27.708 --> 06:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
coming up that I want to um clarify for
 
06:01:29.390 --> 06:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
you all and it's this study that's been
 
06:01:33.350 --> 06:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
referenced um by Fay at all 2022 that's
 
06:01:35.708 --> 06:01:35.718 align:start position:0%
been widely cited by the Wake industry
 
06:01:38.270 --> 06:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
to justify the 200 foot
 
06:01:40.750 --> 06:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
setback um and I just want to read to
 
06:01:43.708 --> 06:01:43.718 align:start position:0%
you a few quotes um from several
 
06:01:45.430 --> 06:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
different scientists and these quotes
 
06:01:49.350 --> 06:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
were compiled um by the Vermont um
 
06:01:52.030 --> 06:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Conservation
 
06:01:54.110 --> 06:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
as they were trying to assess what you
 
06:01:58.030 --> 06:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
all are trying to assess right now so
 
06:02:00.110 --> 06:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
these are some of the quotes this study
 
06:02:02.030 --> 06:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
fails to provide the material and
 
06:02:04.590 --> 06:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
evidence from which to make any sound
 
06:02:06.750 --> 06:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
conclusions it appears that the authors
 
06:02:09.110 --> 06:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
rely very heavily on false claims to
 
06:02:11.030 --> 06:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
make unsubstantiated
 
06:02:13.150 --> 06:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
conclusions it's hard not to question
 
06:02:15.788 --> 06:02:15.798 align:start position:0%
the motives of publishing this paper
 
06:02:17.270 --> 06:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
especially when some of the statements
 
06:02:19.430 --> 06:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
made are clearly not supported by the
 
06:02:23.070 --> 06:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
material presented in the body of the
 
06:02:26.788 --> 06:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
paper you said three minutes apologies
 
06:02:29.948 --> 06:02:29.958 align:start position:0%
for running over I'm very sorry my
 
06:02:33.030 --> 06:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
apologies you could you complete you
 
06:02:35.548 --> 06:02:35.558 align:start position:0%
allow you to that's all right I I will I
 
06:02:37.708 --> 06:02:37.718 align:start position:0%
will conclude right there um but I just
 
06:02:39.150 --> 06:02:39.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to be available to answer any
 
06:02:40.910 --> 06:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
questions on the science if anyone has
 
06:02:43.468 --> 06:02:43.478 align:start position:0%
any questions I'm happy to answer
 
06:02:46.190 --> 06:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
those any questions by members of the
 
06:02:49.310 --> 06:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
committee yes Mr chair um I was just
 
06:02:51.350 --> 06:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have a copy of your
 
06:02:56.030 --> 06:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:58.548 --> 06:02:58.558 align:start position:0%
you I'm we going to be holding people to
 
06:03:01.230 --> 06:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
the 3 minutes is going
 
06:03:04.390 --> 06:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
then we're cuz we still got about a
 
06:03:07.830 --> 06:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:07.840 --> 06:03:10.548 align:start position:0%
 
left

06:03:10.548 --> 06:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
left
 
06:03:13.110 --> 06:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
and so all
 
06:03:15.510 --> 06:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
right any more question any other
 
06:03:17.350 --> 06:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
additional questions by members of the
 
06:03:22.548 --> 06:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none moving right
 
06:03:25.270 --> 06:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
along John
 
06:03:29.150 --> 06:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
Shelly in opposition to the
 
06:03:31.788 --> 06:03:31.798 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:03:33.750 --> 06:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I don't know
 
06:03:35.708 --> 06:03:35.718 align:start position:0%
how you're staying awake but I
 
06:03:38.030 --> 06:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I know some of you maybe
 
06:03:39.628 --> 06:03:39.638 align:start position:0%
uh came in here with a decision made
 
06:03:42.030 --> 06:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
already hopefully most of you have not
 
06:03:43.230 --> 06:03:43.240 align:start position:0%
and you're listening to all the
 
06:03:45.948 --> 06:03:45.958 align:start position:0%
testimony both before uh for and against
 
06:03:47.708 --> 06:03:47.718 align:start position:0%
this bill I am personally against the
 
06:03:49.910 --> 06:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
bill I'm going to keep this short I had
 
06:03:52.030 --> 06:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
a much longer presentation but I am sick
 
06:03:53.310 --> 06:03:53.320 align:start position:0%
of sitting here and want to get home to
 
06:04:00.830 --> 06:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:02.788 --> 06:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is not the answer it's really
 
06:04:05.788 --> 06:04:05.798 align:start position:0%
what it comes down to um it it's
 
06:04:08.430 --> 06:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
targeting it's targeting this particular
 
06:04:10.830 --> 06:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
kind of boat um that supposedly makes a
 
06:04:13.390 --> 06:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
4ot wake and by the way if anybody has a
 
06:04:15.150 --> 06:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
wake booat that actually makes a 4ot
 
06:04:16.948 --> 06:04:16.958 align:start position:0%
wake I want to be behind it because I
 
06:04:19.590 --> 06:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
have yet to be behind one that that's is
 
06:04:21.670 --> 06:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
that big I've got a very very nice wake
 
06:04:23.468 --> 06:04:23.478 align:start position:0%
Boo and it does not get up to four feet
 
06:04:26.830 --> 06:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you that um I think this is
 
06:04:26.840 --> 06:04:27.990 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you that um I think this is
really

06:04:27.990 --> 06:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
06:04:33.150 --> 06:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
more about being annoyed by the waves I
 
06:04:35.070 --> 06:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
really think that's nobody's saying that
 
06:04:37.110 --> 06:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
but I think that's why this bill is here
 
06:04:39.670 --> 06:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
we're we're painting it as something to
 
06:04:42.030 --> 06:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
do with uh protecting the shoreline but
 
06:04:43.310 --> 06:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
I think it's really about being annoyed
 
06:04:44.590 --> 06:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
we're all annoyed by it we're all
 
06:04:46.548 --> 06:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
annoyed by plenty of other boats I'm
 
06:04:49.510 --> 06:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
annoyed by pontoon boats cuz they're in
 
06:04:50.868 --> 06:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
the middle of the lake in the way so we
 
06:04:52.070 --> 06:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
have to swerve around them and they're
 
06:04:53.190 --> 06:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
out there having their drinks I'm
 
06:04:55.830 --> 06:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
annoyed by personal
 
06:04:57.628 --> 06:04:57.638 align:start position:0%
watercraft I I think that's the
 
06:04:59.070 --> 06:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
motivation behind this but that's a
 
06:05:01.150 --> 06:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
personal opinion so that's perhaps not
 
06:05:02.190 --> 06:05:02.200 align:start position:0%
worth anything because you're all
 
06:05:05.628 --> 06:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
looking for faction figures but um I'd
 
06:05:08.590 --> 06:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
like to point out that um that one of
 
06:05:10.590 --> 06:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
the people that were was a proponent of
 
06:05:11.990 --> 06:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
the bill was talking about how this is a
 
06:05:15.150 --> 06:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
very small percentage uh that this kind
 
06:05:16.990 --> 06:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
of boat is a small percentage of all the
 
06:05:19.628 --> 06:05:19.638 align:start position:0%
boats uh talking about the economy well
 
06:05:21.430 --> 06:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
if it is a small percentage then the
 
06:05:22.990 --> 06:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
damage that's coming from all the other
 
06:05:24.990 --> 06:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
boats the damage to the Shoreline is
 
06:05:27.708 --> 06:05:27.718 align:start position:0%
going to add up as well I've owned owned
 
06:05:29.708 --> 06:05:29.718 align:start position:0%
waterfront property for 20 years I live
 
06:05:32.110 --> 06:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
on it year round all the time I have sat
 
06:05:34.350 --> 06:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
out there ever since this these types of
 
06:05:35.830 --> 06:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
bills have started coming up and I've
 
06:05:37.708 --> 06:05:37.718 align:start position:0%
sat around and I've literally sat out
 
06:05:41.110 --> 06:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
back and I've counted waves and measured
 
06:05:43.510 --> 06:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
waves during a summer storm and looked
 
06:05:46.788 --> 06:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
at the actual damage to my Shoreline and
 
06:05:48.590 --> 06:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
I can tell you and this is my actual
 
06:05:50.468 --> 06:05:50.478 align:start position:0%
testimony as if I'm under oath I'm
 
06:05:52.110 --> 06:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
speaking as if I'm under oath I am under
 
06:05:54.390 --> 06:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
oath it's the truth I see more damage
 
06:05:57.548 --> 06:05:57.558 align:start position:0%
from one summer storm
 
06:06:00.430 --> 06:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
than I ever do from an entire summer of
 
06:06:02.430 --> 06:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
of uh boating activities all different
 
06:06:04.868 --> 06:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
kinds including wake boats okay so you
 
06:06:07.270 --> 06:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
can't pinpoint it on this one particular
 
06:06:10.430 --> 06:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
kind of boat and furthermore we are we
 
06:06:12.708 --> 06:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
are all self-regulating I go out there
 
06:06:14.788 --> 06:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
and I talk to other wake boers and I say
 
06:06:16.590 --> 06:06:16.600 align:start position:0%
hey you're too close to shore we're
 
06:06:18.310 --> 06:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
getting it out when we first had
 
06:06:20.110 --> 06:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft we all hated them
 
06:06:21.910 --> 06:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
too and tried to litigate against them
 
06:06:23.708 --> 06:06:23.718 align:start position:0%
as well but you know what we didn't put
 
06:06:25.708 --> 06:06:25.718 align:start position:0%
a law up but people got more common
 
06:06:27.350 --> 06:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
sense people got a little more whereare
 
06:06:29.150 --> 06:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
we took care of it as boers as
 
06:06:32.270 --> 06:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
responsible boers okay we do care about
 
06:06:33.990 --> 06:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
your Shoreline believe me I don't want
 
06:06:35.750 --> 06:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
to do any big damage to that but I don't
 
06:06:37.190 --> 06:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
believe this particular kind of boat and
 
06:06:39.230 --> 06:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
don't forget that you can sit there in a
 
06:06:41.190 --> 06:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
boat without any ballasts and go around
 
06:06:43.430 --> 06:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
in circles and figure eights just like
 
06:06:45.670 --> 06:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
we do when we're pulling uh tubers and
 
06:06:48.350 --> 06:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
make waves that are much bigger than uh
 
06:06:49.990 --> 06:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
that from behind a boat my 3 minutes is
 
06:06:53.350 --> 06:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
up and I yield and uh we'll answer
 
06:06:55.830 --> 06:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
questions any questions by members of

James alen A or AI h e n a
 
06:07:19.788 --> 06:07:19.798 align:start position:0%
n what here how do you how do you spell
 
06:07:25.910 --> 06:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:29.990 --> 06:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:33.910 --> 06:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
minutes I have a copy of uh my testimony
 
06:07:37.350 --> 06:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
as well as a map of Province Lake my
 
06:07:38.510 --> 06:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
name is Jim
 
06:07:41.270 --> 06:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
Aken and I'm the current president of
 
06:07:42.990 --> 06:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
the Province Lake
 
06:07:45.110 --> 06:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
Association and I'm in favor of House

Association and I'm in favor of House
Bill

06:07:46.990 --> 06:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
06:07:50.548 --> 06:07:50.558 align:start position:0%
1390 to limit the specific use of wake
 
06:07:53.310 --> 06:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
Sports in New Hampshire's smaller more
 
06:07:56.628 --> 06:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
shallower bodies of water Province Lake
 
06:08:00.270 --> 06:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
is not a small Lake it's about a mile in
 
06:08:04.310 --> 06:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
diameter but its deepest point is 17 ft
 
06:08:06.190 --> 06:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
so it's an example of a lake that really
 
06:08:11.150 --> 06:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
gets churned up by any water uh boat but
 
06:08:14.350 --> 06:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
specifically the type of boat that
 
06:08:17.030 --> 06:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
churns the water more plows through the
 
06:08:19.430 --> 06:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
water uh in
 
06:08:22.670 --> 06:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
2023 Province Lake was under
 
06:08:25.070 --> 06:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria warning four different
 
06:08:29.390 --> 06:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
times with a total of 85 days that's a
 
06:08:31.230 --> 06:08:31.240 align:start position:0%
big part of our
 
06:08:34.548 --> 06:08:34.558 align:start position:0%
summer cyano bacteria blooms occur when
 
06:08:37.468 --> 06:08:37.478 align:start position:0%
excess nutrients are present our primary
 
06:08:41.110 --> 06:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
source of nutrients at Province Lake is
 
06:08:43.350 --> 06:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
from the rich sediment at the bottom of
 
06:08:43.360 --> 06:08:45.708 align:start position:0%
from the rich sediment at the bottom of
our

06:08:45.708 --> 06:08:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:48.430 --> 06:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
Lake uh storm events do bring more
 
06:08:50.430 --> 06:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
sediment in but all that does is
 
06:08:51.910 --> 06:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
contribute to the
 
06:08:54.390 --> 06:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
Loading making the sediment more
 
06:08:54.400 --> 06:08:55.708 align:start position:0%
Loading making the sediment more
phosphorus

06:08:55.708 --> 06:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
phosphorus
 
06:08:55.718 --> 06:08:57.708 align:start position:0%
phosphorus
rich

06:08:57.708 --> 06:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
rich
 
06:09:00.070 --> 06:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
erosion is another problem that it's
 
06:09:05.590 --> 06:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:08.150 --> 06:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
testimony and that the these boats are L
 
06:09:09.868 --> 06:09:09.878 align:start position:0%
are more apt to create
 
06:09:11.910 --> 06:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
erosion one thing that we're very proud
 
06:09:14.468 --> 06:09:14.478 align:start position:0%
of at Province Lake is the fact that we
 
06:09:17.830 --> 06:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
have no identified invasive species we
 
06:09:19.590 --> 06:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
are concerned that boats with ballast
 
06:09:21.190 --> 06:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
moving from Lake to Lake are
 
06:09:23.590 --> 06:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities for invasive species to
 
06:09:26.030 --> 06:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
catch a ride if these boats are not
 
06:09:27.708 --> 06:09:27.718 align:start position:0%
properly drained
 
06:09:29.670 --> 06:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
a Shallow Lake like ours would be the
 
06:09:32.270 --> 06:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
perfect environment for invasive weeds
 
06:09:34.750 --> 06:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
to thrive if
 
06:09:36.868 --> 06:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
introduced we're trying to educate
 
06:09:39.430 --> 06:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
ourselves and our membership on ways to
 
06:09:42.708 --> 06:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
lessen cyanobacteria blooms the bottom
 
06:09:44.788 --> 06:09:44.798 align:start position:0%
line is that we need to control sources
 
06:09:47.110 --> 06:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
of nutrients getting into our
 
06:09:50.948 --> 06:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
Lake and existing nutrients nutrients
 
06:09:52.750 --> 06:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
keep undisturbed as
 
06:09:54.948 --> 06:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
possible I'm sure my support of this
 
06:09:56.948 --> 06:09:56.958 align:start position:0%
bill will be unpopular with some of our
 
06:09:58.830 --> 06:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
membership but I see it as an
 
06:10:01.468 --> 06:10:01.478 align:start position:0%
opportunity we cannot ignore it will
 
06:10:03.190 --> 06:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully just be one of the many pieces
 
06:10:05.628 --> 06:10:05.638 align:start position:0%
of the puzzle we need to improve the
 
06:10:07.670 --> 06:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
health of our Lake for future
 
06:10:09.230 --> 06:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
generations to
 
06:10:12.750 --> 06:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
come um we're grasping at straws for
 
06:10:17.628 --> 06:10:17.638 align:start position:0%
anything um to reduce nutrients um
 
06:10:21.510 --> 06:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
plantings along the road Route 153 is
 
06:10:24.750 --> 06:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
about a mile and a half long on the main
 
06:10:27.670 --> 06:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire border it's basically a
 
06:10:30.910 --> 06:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
privately owned Beach um where water
 
06:10:35.230 --> 06:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
runoff just spills things in so um our
 
06:10:35.240 --> 06:10:36.390 align:start position:0%
runoff just spills things in so um our
membership

06:10:36.390 --> 06:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
membership
 
06:10:39.628 --> 06:10:39.638 align:start position:0%
is upset by the whole thing the C of
 
06:10:41.270 --> 06:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
bacteria blooms and we're doing anything
 
06:10:46.548 --> 06:10:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:49.590 --> 06:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
questions still have another couple of
 
06:10:53.030 --> 06:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
seconds I timed it last night I wasn't
 
06:10:57.150 --> 06:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
as nervous is there is there any uh any
 
06:10:59.310 --> 06:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
questions by members of the
 
06:11:02.310 --> 06:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
committee being none thank you very much
 
06:11:04.468 --> 06:11:04.478 align:start position:0%
if you could if you had stuff stuff you
 
06:11:08.150 --> 06:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
want to have to pass out yeah uh just uh
 
06:11:09.708 --> 06:11:09.718 align:start position:0%
maybe give it to the end of the table
 
06:11:11.868 --> 06:11:11.878 align:start position:0%
and then we'll just pass it uh it'll
 
06:11:14.190 --> 06:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
just passed
 
06:11:14.200 --> 06:11:17.030 align:start position:0%
just passed
down

06:11:17.030 --> 06:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
down
 
06:11:21.110 --> 06:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay in opposition to the bill Carl and
 
06:11:21.120 --> 06:11:25.548 align:start position:0%
okay in opposition to the bill Carl and
Aaron

06:11:25.548 --> 06:11:25.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:25.558 --> 06:11:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
Jagger

06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:31.670 --> 06:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon hopefully get us close to
 
06:11:34.350 --> 06:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
the uh okay good afternoon thank you for
 
06:11:37.350 --> 06:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
speak Cloud okay are are you going
 
06:11:39.788 --> 06:11:39.798 align:start position:0%
together or or do you want three three
 
06:11:41.868 --> 06:11:41.878 align:start position:0%
minutes each we'll try to we'll try to
 
06:11:43.750 --> 06:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
do this three minutes but we may go a
 
06:11:45.510 --> 06:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
little over how about we go I'll go give
 
06:11:48.670 --> 06:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
you five okay together that's sounds
 
06:11:51.230 --> 06:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
good so we go ahead so we live on
 
06:11:54.948 --> 06:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
Arlington Pond um Arlington Reservoir we
 
06:11:58.190 --> 06:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
are in opposition of the will uh kind of
 
06:12:00.110 --> 06:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to explain a few things my wife
 
06:12:02.190 --> 06:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
and I moved to New Hampshire four years
 
06:12:04.670 --> 06:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
ago we specifically researched lakes in
 
06:12:07.390 --> 06:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the state itself to
 
06:12:09.350 --> 06:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
decide for where we were going to move
 
06:12:11.750 --> 06:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
and we bought our house on Arlington
 
06:12:15.990 --> 06:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
Pond uh if we had seen this coming or it
 
06:12:17.708 --> 06:12:17.718 align:start position:0%
was in place we would not be in New
 
06:12:20.150 --> 06:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we would not be on this Lake
 
06:12:23.190 --> 06:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
um so explain a little about Arlington
 
06:12:26.948 --> 06:12:26.958 align:start position:0%
Pond it it is over 200 Acres of the Lake
 
06:12:28.670 --> 06:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
it's a good siiz Pond but there is an
 
06:12:31.830 --> 06:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
island in the middle of it if you take
 
06:12:33.990 --> 06:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
500 ft on each side of the boat we have
 
06:12:36.548 --> 06:12:36.558 align:start position:0%
eliminated wake Sports entirely on the
 
06:12:38.468 --> 06:12:38.478 align:start position:0%
lake if there maybe there's a pin prick
 
06:12:40.070 --> 06:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
of a spot but you sure can't drive a
 
06:12:42.390 --> 06:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
boat around in a pin prick so you are
 
06:12:44.270 --> 06:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
going to eliminate wak Sports entirely
 
06:12:45.670 --> 06:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
on a lake that is one of the main
 
06:12:47.548 --> 06:12:47.558 align:start position:0%
reasons we bought
 
06:12:47.558 --> 06:12:50.350 align:start position:0%
reasons we bought
here

06:12:50.350 --> 06:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:12:55.110 --> 06:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
um with that I would say at least 50 the
 
06:12:57.990 --> 06:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
majority of the L lake has boats and
 
06:13:00.310 --> 06:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
they do wake Sports of one sort or
 
06:13:01.990 --> 06:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
another behind it you're going to
 
06:13:03.788 --> 06:13:03.798 align:start position:0%
eliminate all that wake sporting on the
 
06:13:05.430 --> 06:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
lake you're going to eliminate a lot of
 
06:13:06.868 --> 06:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
people that are going to
 
06:13:09.190 --> 06:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
move and you're going to eliminate a lot
 
06:13:10.868 --> 06:13:10.878 align:start position:0%
of people that are willing to buy a
 
06:13:12.788 --> 06:13:12.798 align:start position:0%
house on the lake so our Val property
 
06:13:14.390 --> 06:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
values I would expect would be
 
06:13:19.230 --> 06:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
significantly reduced with this um so it
 
06:13:20.910 --> 06:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
this now leaves me with an expensive
 
06:13:23.270 --> 06:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
lake house that I really can't use for
 
06:13:25.190 --> 06:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
what I bought it for an expensive
 
06:13:27.190 --> 06:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
wakeboarding boat that I really can't
 
06:13:28.590 --> 06:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
use for what I bought it for other than
 
06:13:30.670 --> 06:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
maybe the putt putts around the lake
 
06:13:32.670 --> 06:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's kind of disappointing the bill
 
06:13:34.948 --> 06:13:34.958 align:start position:0%
has no grandfather type clause and of
 
06:13:37.110 --> 06:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
allowing us the people that have an
 
06:13:38.750 --> 06:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
expensive lake house that bought up here
 
06:13:41.030 --> 06:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
for this reason that bought a Bo boat
 
06:13:43.310 --> 06:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
for this reason to continue to use it it
 
06:13:46.190 --> 06:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
puts a limitation on as of July 1st
 
06:13:48.030 --> 06:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
could you imagine putting a limitation
 
06:13:50.468 --> 06:13:50.478 align:start position:0%
saying July 1st no motorcycles can drive
 
06:13:54.510 --> 06:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:57.990 --> 06:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
happen so going specifically to the bill
 
06:14:00.788 --> 06:14:00.798 align:start position:0%
itself uh the Wake Sports definition
 
06:14:03.150 --> 06:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
it's confusing it calls
 
06:14:06.990 --> 06:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
out uh surfboard wakeboard hydrofoil and
 
06:14:09.270 --> 06:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
then additionally it states or similar
 
06:14:14.070 --> 06:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
devices to ride on or behind the
 
06:14:18.548 --> 06:14:18.558 align:start position:0%
Wake what is that tubing water skiing
 
06:14:21.628 --> 06:14:21.638 align:start position:0%
Barefoot skiing kneeboarding that's all
 
06:14:24.708 --> 06:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
rides behind the wake uh so you are
 
06:14:27.590 --> 06:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
eliminating anything to do with Towing
 
06:14:31.670 --> 06:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:35.670 --> 06:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
boat and then additionally it the limit
 
06:14:38.350 --> 06:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
it says you can't do anything unless you
 
06:14:41.030 --> 06:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
have a swim platform behind the
 
06:14:43.830 --> 06:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
motor and I understand for wake surfing
 
06:14:46.110 --> 06:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
that makes a lot of sense wake surfing
 
06:14:49.868 --> 06:14:49.878 align:start position:0%
is probably 0 to 15 feet you're doing it
 
06:14:52.350 --> 06:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
behind the boat so being away from the
 
06:14:55.270 --> 06:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
motor very important for safety but
 
06:14:58.070 --> 06:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
tubing water skiing wakeboarding all
 
06:15:01.910 --> 06:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
that is 50 plus feet back of the boat I
 
06:15:03.310 --> 06:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
we've been people have been doing that
 
06:15:06.430 --> 06:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
for decades and decades without a safety
 
06:15:07.590 --> 06:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
issue because you're not going to run
 
06:15:11.628 --> 06:15:11.638 align:start position:0%
into the prop 50 fet back of the boat so
 
06:15:15.990 --> 06:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
in that limitation now puts it
 
06:15:19.070 --> 06:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
eliminates Tu being behind a pontoon
 
06:15:21.430 --> 06:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
boat you know water skiing behind a
 
06:15:23.270 --> 06:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
pontoon boat wakeboarding behind a
 
06:15:26.310 --> 06:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
pontoon boat behind a fishing boat we
 
06:15:28.670 --> 06:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
did a 13t fishing boat with a 25
 
06:15:30.708 --> 06:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
horsepower motor when my son was small
 
06:15:32.310 --> 06:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
he wakeboarded behind it you don't need
 
06:15:33.830 --> 06:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
a big weight you don't need a big boat
 
06:15:36.110 --> 06:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
for that
 
06:15:40.030 --> 06:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
um let's see trying to think of all
 
06:15:42.788 --> 06:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
these uh so one of the other ones people
 
06:15:44.830 --> 06:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
ask how long a weight boards boats been
 
06:15:44.840 --> 06:15:46.030 align:start position:0%
ask how long a weight boards boats been
in

06:15:46.030 --> 06:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:15:48.628 --> 06:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
existence our boat is a
 
06:15:52.110 --> 06:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
2004 20 years now it's been in existence
 
06:15:54.788 --> 06:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
we use we use that boat that boat
 
06:15:56.670 --> 06:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
nowhere near produces the wake that some
 
06:15:59.190 --> 06:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
of the newer ones do if I'm towing
 
06:16:01.670 --> 06:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
someone little kid I'm going to put no
 
06:16:04.150 --> 06:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
ballast in that boat at all they more
 
06:16:07.150 --> 06:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
than good at doing that uh and I can I
 
06:16:10.070 --> 06:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
can raise my ballast up so you're
 
06:16:12.030 --> 06:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
Banning you're Banning me with a 20
 
06:16:13.670 --> 06:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
20-year boat that doesn't produce
 
06:16:16.430 --> 06:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere near the size wake than the
 
06:16:18.590 --> 06:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
newer boats what you should be doing if
 
06:16:20.948 --> 06:16:20.958 align:start position:0%
you're going to do something with waves
 
06:16:24.670 --> 06:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
ban the size of the wave is it you know
 
06:16:26.910 --> 06:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
is it a is it a 4ft w wave that is it a
 
06:16:26.920 --> 06:16:27.990 align:start position:0%
is it a is it a 4ft w wave that is it a
three-foot

06:16:27.990 --> 06:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
three-foot
 
06:16:31.948 --> 06:16:31.958 align:start position:0%
wave just yep I'm going to pass the mic
 
06:16:33.270 --> 06:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
so I just want to talk a little bit
 
06:16:35.788 --> 06:16:35.798 align:start position:0%
about cyano bacteria because Arlington
 
06:16:39.670 --> 06:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
Pond had a terrible year last year but
 
06:16:42.390 --> 06:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
you know I'm on a committee that's
 
06:16:44.430 --> 06:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
looking into that and the primary cause
 
06:16:47.628 --> 06:16:47.638 align:start position:0%
is nutrients it's the phosphorus and the
 
06:16:51.590 --> 06:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
nitrogen so control those you know look
 
06:16:54.350 --> 06:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
at the primary cause our first blooms
 
06:16:56.910 --> 06:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
were in May long before anybody started
 
06:16:59.070 --> 06:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
any wak Sports and then the balloom
 
06:17:01.590 --> 06:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
continued from the end of June through
 
06:17:03.868 --> 06:17:03.878 align:start position:0%
October there were very few of any wakes
 
06:17:06.030 --> 06:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
Sports going on during that time because
 
06:17:08.948 --> 06:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
we had cyanobacteria in the lake if it
 
06:17:10.750 --> 06:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
was only caused by the wakeboarding
 
06:17:12.830 --> 06:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
boats it would have stopped we it
 
06:17:14.670 --> 06:17:14.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have continued on for a 100
 
06:17:17.990 --> 06:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
days so it bothers me that people are
 
06:17:20.150 --> 06:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
blaming the ca blooms only on the
 
06:17:21.788 --> 06:17:21.798 align:start position:0%
wakeboarding boats you really need to
 
06:17:23.788 --> 06:17:23.798 align:start position:0%
look at the true source and control the
 
06:17:26.150 --> 06:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
nutrients going into the lake not these
 
06:17:26.160 --> 06:17:28.430 align:start position:0%
nutrients going into the lake not these
boats

06:17:28.430 --> 06:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
boats
 
06:17:31.310 --> 06:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
specifically and and I just think in
 
06:17:33.628 --> 06:17:33.638 align:start position:0%
general we need to look at enforcement
 
06:17:35.788 --> 06:17:35.798 align:start position:0%
and hiring the proper number of Marine
 
06:17:38.030 --> 06:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
Patrol to enforce the bills we currently
 
06:17:40.708 --> 06:17:40.718 align:start position:0%
have don't put more bills on that there
 
06:17:44.150 --> 06:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
have no way of enforcing anyway thank
 
06:17:49.590 --> 06:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:54.910 --> 06:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:54.920 --> 06:17:57.070 align:start position:0%
 
much

06:17:57.070 --> 06:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
much
 
06:17:59.788 --> 06:17:59.798 align:start position:0%
I'll give that to the clerk thank you it
 
06:18:02.230 --> 06:18:02.240 align:start position:0%

surf behind our boats without the
 
06:19:49.628 --> 06:19:49.638 align:start position:0%
Rope I can personally tell you when this
 
06:19:52.948 --> 06:19:52.958 align:start position:0%

stories with you from the events over
 
06:20:04.110 --> 06:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
the last two years after a day on the
 
06:20:05.510 --> 06:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
water with others who have shared the
 
06:20:08.350 --> 06:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
same life experiences we gathered the
 
06:20:10.070 --> 06:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
group together and asked them what the
 
06:20:14.030 --> 06:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
day meant to them Chris an Army Ranger
 
06:20:15.948 --> 06:20:15.958 align:start position:0%
who just rep returned from being
 
06:20:20.430 --> 06:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
deployed overseas when asked when he was
 
06:20:22.868 --> 06:20:22.878 align:start position:0%
asked what did you get out of the day he
 
06:20:26.750 --> 06:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
replied with I am an Army Ranger
 
06:20:29.708 --> 06:20:29.718 align:start position:0%
I am supposed to be tough and not let
 
06:20:32.430 --> 06:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
things bother me over the course of the
 
06:20:33.708 --> 06:20:33.718 align:start position:0%
last 3
 
06:20:37.548 --> 06:20:37.558 align:start position:0%
years everything I do or see that I
 
06:20:40.670 --> 06:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
always loved is now black and white to
 
06:20:44.310 --> 06:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
me I am a ranger I am supposed to be
 
06:20:46.990 --> 06:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
tough I have not seen color in three
 
06:20:50.990 --> 06:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
years and today because of this event I
 
06:20:53.628 --> 06:20:53.638 align:start position:0%
see color for the first
 
06:20:58.030 --> 06:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
time Tom a firefighter from nashar who
 
06:21:00.990 --> 06:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
after a day on the water stated while
 
06:21:03.788 --> 06:21:03.798 align:start position:0%
sobbing I pulled a six-month-old baby
 
06:21:06.070 --> 06:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
out of a burning house and could not
 
06:21:08.670 --> 06:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
revive it while the baby's mother was
 
06:21:12.830 --> 06:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
watching it tore him up he has never
 
06:21:15.590 --> 06:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
told that story before and I can assure
 
06:21:18.468 --> 06:21:18.478 align:start position:0%
you that after hearing these stories and
 
06:21:21.310 --> 06:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
others who opened up there were 11
 
06:21:24.430 --> 06:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
people standing around in tears all
 
06:21:26.628 --> 06:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
because of a day on the w water wake
 
06:21:29.350 --> 06:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
surfing the Salem Police Department and
 
06:21:31.628 --> 06:21:31.638 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Army National Guard
 
06:21:34.110 --> 06:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
who sent six officers and Four soldiers
 
06:21:36.548 --> 06:21:36.558 align:start position:0%
this past to this past Year's Event
 
06:21:39.310 --> 06:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
wants to send more this year as part of
 
06:21:42.310 --> 06:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
their wellness program by creating a
 
06:21:45.708 --> 06:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
500t rule and a depth requirement you
 
06:21:48.150 --> 06:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
will be limiting lakes and rivers where
 
06:21:50.468 --> 06:21:50.478 align:start position:0%
we can put on events like these and
 
06:21:52.788 --> 06:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
eliminate the rights of others who live
 
06:21:56.468 --> 06:21:56.478 align:start position:0%
on smaller Lakes I urge you all to vote
 
06:22:00.110 --> 06:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
no on HB 1390 thank

management and education with respect to
 
06:23:02.628 --> 06:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
potential impacts to loons we emphasize
 
06:23:04.750 --> 06:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
the following reasons that we support H
 
06:23:07.510 --> 06:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
spill 1390 the first is that Lon nests
 
06:23:09.948 --> 06:23:09.958 align:start position:0%
can be destroyed by wave action loons
 
06:23:11.910 --> 06:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
are adapted to swimming and Diving and
 
06:23:14.190 --> 06:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
not walking they move with difficulty on
 
06:23:16.110 --> 06:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
land and therefore they always Nest
 
06:23:18.548 --> 06:23:18.558 align:start position:0%
right at the water's edge waves from
 
06:23:20.350 --> 06:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
boat weaks can watch over loon nests
 
06:23:22.948 --> 06:23:22.958 align:start position:0%
causing them to fail in some cases
 
06:23:24.788 --> 06:23:24.798 align:start position:0%
nesting is when loons are most
 
06:23:26.310 --> 06:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and and despite our best
 
06:23:28.948 --> 06:23:28.958 align:start position:0%
efforts over 40% of Lon nests fail in
 
06:23:31.350 --> 06:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire intensive management of
 
06:23:33.430 --> 06:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
Nest sites has been needed to continue
 
06:23:36.270 --> 06:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
the hard one ongoing recovery of loons
 
06:23:38.310 --> 06:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
which remain a threatened species in the
 
06:23:41.430 --> 06:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
state we agree with a 500 foot or more
 
06:23:43.110 --> 06:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
standard because it is supported by
 
06:23:45.750 --> 06:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
reputable studies and I know that the
 
06:23:47.468 --> 06:23:47.478 align:start position:0%
the national Marine manufacturers
 
06:23:49.468 --> 06:23:49.478 align:start position:0%
Association study this is the fadal
 
06:23:51.830 --> 06:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
study recommended a much lower standard
 
06:23:55.510 --> 06:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
of 200 ft that deeply flawed study was
 
06:23:57.390 --> 06:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
based on computer models that the
 
06:24:00.070 --> 06:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
authors themselves stated are not
 
06:24:02.468 --> 06:24:02.478 align:start position:0%
accurate at distances of more than three
 
06:24:05.590 --> 06:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
boat lengths and of no value at more
 
06:24:08.190 --> 06:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
than 100 ft from the boat their
 
06:24:10.390 --> 06:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
unsubstantiated recommendation for a
 
06:24:12.990 --> 06:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
200t standard is an outlier among other
 
06:24:15.030 --> 06:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
wak Sports studies which recommend
 
06:24:17.910 --> 06:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
minimum protective zones of up to 1,000
 
06:24:21.030 --> 06:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
ft or more wakes sport studies that use
 
06:24:23.310 --> 06:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
actual field measurements cite wave
 
06:24:24.670 --> 06:24:24.680 align:start position:0%
heights and wave energy that are
 
06:24:26.868 --> 06:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
significantly greater than other forms
 
06:24:29.070 --> 06:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
of boating so for example water
 
06:24:31.030 --> 06:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
environmental Consultants found that
 
06:24:33.030 --> 06:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
wake surfing produced a greater than 7
 
06:24:37.030 --> 06:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
in high wave even at 500 ft distance and
 
06:24:40.350 --> 06:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
a 499 per increase in wave energy
 
06:24:43.150 --> 06:24:43.160 align:start position:0%
compared to a cruising boat a wave of
 
06:24:45.430 --> 06:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
this height and power would still swamp
 
06:24:47.070 --> 06:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
many loon nests in New Hampshire which
 
06:24:49.310 --> 06:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
are typically less than 6 in above the
 
06:24:52.070 --> 06:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
water line so even a 500t protective
 
06:24:55.350 --> 06:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
Zone will not protect all loon nests but
 
06:24:57.030 --> 06:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
we recognize that we are trying to
 
06:24:59.270 --> 06:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
balance our desire to recreate with our
 
06:25:02.190 --> 06:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
loon need to procreate and 500 ft is
 
06:25:03.910 --> 06:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
certainly better than other standards
 
06:25:06.310 --> 06:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
that have been proposed we're also
 
06:25:08.468 --> 06:25:08.478 align:start position:0%
concerned about shoreline erosion and
 
06:25:10.830 --> 06:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
water quality loons are visual hunters
 
06:25:12.830 --> 06:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
and they need clean clear water to catch
 
06:25:15.350 --> 06:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
fish the potential for wake surfing to
 
06:25:17.628 --> 06:25:17.638 align:start position:0%
increase shoreline erosion and turbidity
 
06:25:19.868 --> 06:25:19.878 align:start position:0%
of our legs me to reduced ability of
 
06:25:22.230 --> 06:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
lons and other Aquatic animals to find
 
06:25:25.390 --> 06:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
Nest sites and food uh in testimony
 
06:25:26.948 --> 06:25:26.958 align:start position:0%
today and also for an earlier bill I
 
06:25:28.948 --> 06:25:28.958 align:start position:0%
heard lobbyists say that L are doing
 
06:25:30.670 --> 06:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
fine in New Hampshire and the real
 
06:25:33.110 --> 06:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
problem for L is lead fishing tackle and
 
06:25:35.070 --> 06:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
I agree that lead tackle continues to
 
06:25:37.350 --> 06:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
kill loons in New Hampshire but I do
 
06:25:38.990 --> 06:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
want to set the record straight on a
 
06:25:41.910 --> 06:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
couple of points we experienced no
 
06:25:44.230 --> 06:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
growth in Lon Paris last year over the
 
06:25:46.110 --> 06:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
year previously and we had a record
 
06:25:48.390 --> 06:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
number of Nest failures including a
 
06:25:50.270 --> 06:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
record number of failures from flooded
 
06:25:53.190 --> 06:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
nests loons are facing many threats not
 
06:25:55.350 --> 06:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
just one and wake sports are imp imp
 
06:25:56.990 --> 06:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
acting the recovery of this threatened
 
06:25:59.670 --> 06:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
and much-loved species so we support
 
06:26:00.910 --> 06:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
efforts to provide these needed
 
06:26:02.910 --> 06:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
protections for lakes and loons and we
 
06:26:04.788 --> 06:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
support the standards proposed in House
 
06:26:07.670 --> 06:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
Bill 1390 as a bare minimum to help
 
06:26:09.750 --> 06:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
protect the wildlife and the lakes that
 
06:26:12.350 --> 06:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
we value so highly in New Hampshire
 
06:26:13.868 --> 06:26:13.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for considering lons and other
 
06:26:16.110 --> 06:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
wildlife in your contemplation of House
 
06:26:18.270 --> 06:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
Bill 1390 that is the end of my
 
06:26:20.150 --> 06:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
testimony and I would be happy to answer
 
06:26:23.030 --> 06:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions by members
 
06:26:25.430 --> 06:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the committee yes Mr chair I I have
 
06:26:28.548 --> 06:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
one for a question thank you and thank
 
06:26:31.150 --> 06:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr vogle for your testimony um
 
06:26:32.868 --> 06:26:32.878 align:start position:0%
several people that have testified
 
06:26:36.270 --> 06:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
earlier are saying that the Senate Bill
 
06:26:40.390 --> 06:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
431 would be an adequate bill for to
 
06:26:43.310 --> 06:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
protect the Shor line um has the Loon
 
06:26:45.070 --> 06:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
preservation committee taken a position
 
06:26:47.628 --> 06:26:47.638 align:start position:0%
on that bill and if so what is it yes
 
06:26:49.708 --> 06:26:49.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um we have we
 
06:26:52.430 --> 06:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
are absolutely in opposition to a 200
 
06:26:54.070 --> 06:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
foot Bill we don't think that that is
 
06:26:56.788 --> 06:26:56.798 align:start position:0%
nearly enough and in fact even a 500t
 
06:27:00.468 --> 06:27:00.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:04.510 --> 06:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
compromise Mr chair for a question thank
 
06:27:06.230 --> 06:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
06:27:10.590 --> 06:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
question can you describe um why goons
 
06:27:13.868 --> 06:27:13.878 align:start position:0%
nests would not be impacted by wind
 
06:27:18.070 --> 06:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
driven waves and uh impacted by um the
 
06:27:21.510 --> 06:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
waves of boats yes uh thank you it's a
 
06:27:23.868 --> 06:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
very good question so um loons have been
 
06:27:25.788 --> 06:27:25.798 align:start position:0%
tuned through evolution they're about a
 
06:27:28.548 --> 06:27:28.558 align:start position:0%
20 million year old species um and so
 
06:27:30.548 --> 06:27:30.558 align:start position:0%
loons know instinctively to nest on the
 
06:27:33.310 --> 06:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
leeward side of islands and Shor lines
 
06:27:35.390 --> 06:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
that are protected by by the prevailing
 
06:27:37.150 --> 06:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
wind and waves that doesn't mean that we
 
06:27:38.910 --> 06:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
can't on occasion have a nor Easter you
 
06:27:40.788 --> 06:27:40.798 align:start position:0%
know come through and and wash out some
 
06:27:43.030 --> 06:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
some loons um but they they are
 
06:27:45.310 --> 06:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
definitely tuned in uh to the prevailing
 
06:27:47.150 --> 06:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
wind and wave action by the time they're
 
06:27:49.150 --> 06:27:49.160 align:start position:0%
nesting they've been on that Lake for a
 
06:27:51.310 --> 06:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
month they know where the waves are and
 
06:27:52.830 --> 06:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
where they'll they'll receive protection
 
06:27:55.070 --> 06:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
from the waves unfortunately evolution
 
06:28:01.430 --> 06:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:04.030 --> 06:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
sports for for a
 
06:28:07.708 --> 06:28:07.718 align:start position:0%
question thank you um as a person that
 
06:28:09.628 --> 06:28:09.638 align:start position:0%
lives on a lake and has Lon Nest thank
 
06:28:14.150 --> 06:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
you very much Canby Lake uh question is
 
06:28:16.830 --> 06:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
how many times do people put out the
 
06:28:21.190 --> 06:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
buoys to say to protect the Loon nest
 
06:28:22.670 --> 06:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
and how many of those do you actually
 
06:28:24.830 --> 06:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
put out across your Lakes cuz I know I
 
06:28:26.868 --> 06:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
have have those buoys underneath a set
 
06:28:28.590 --> 06:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
of steps at my house right now each time
 
06:28:32.070 --> 06:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
loons lay eggs sure thank you for the
 
06:28:33.750 --> 06:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
question so if you're referring to our L
 
06:28:36.948 --> 06:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
nesting area signs so um we put those
 
06:28:39.350 --> 06:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
signs out in on quite a number of lakes
 
06:28:41.030 --> 06:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
in fact more than one out of every two
 
06:28:42.670 --> 06:28:42.680 align:start position:0%
chicks that are hatched in New Hampshire
 
06:28:44.390 --> 06:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
come from a nesting site that's
 
06:28:46.548 --> 06:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
protected by those uh signs and rope
 
06:28:49.390 --> 06:28:49.400 align:start position:0%
lines so um we work with Lake owners you
 
06:28:51.150 --> 06:28:51.160 align:start position:0%
know to decide whether or not to put out
 
06:28:52.510 --> 06:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
those signs some people think they just
 
06:28:54.510 --> 06:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
bring more attention to lons other
 
06:28:56.708 --> 06:28:56.718 align:start position:0%
people are absolutely wanting to have
 
06:28:58.948 --> 06:28:58.958 align:start position:0%
those those signs and rope lines so if
 
06:29:00.750 --> 06:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
we feel that they're Justified and if we
 
06:29:04.468 --> 06:29:04.478 align:start position:0%
can find uh that Lake users and and Lake
 
06:29:06.230 --> 06:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
residents are are in support of that
 
06:29:09.230 --> 06:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
then we'll absolutely put those signs
 
06:29:12.830 --> 06:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
up for a follow up thank
 
06:29:16.910 --> 06:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
you um the follow question is what's
 
06:29:19.350 --> 06:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
your recommended distance when those
 
06:29:22.030 --> 06:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
signs are out that you give voters and
 
06:29:24.990 --> 06:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
residents on the lake yeah uh thank you
 
06:29:27.468 --> 06:29:27.478 align:start position:0%
it's that's another good question so we
 
06:29:30.070 --> 06:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
typically go by the loons themselves um
 
06:29:32.190 --> 06:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
and and so as we approach a loon that's
 
06:29:34.670 --> 06:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
sitting on a nest we look for any signs
 
06:29:36.548 --> 06:29:36.558 align:start position:0%
that that loon is is beginning to react
 
06:29:38.670 --> 06:29:38.680 align:start position:0%
to our presence often that's just like
 
06:29:40.948 --> 06:29:40.958 align:start position:0%
craning the head low across the lake at
 
06:29:42.708 --> 06:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
that point we know that we're within
 
06:29:44.468 --> 06:29:44.478 align:start position:0%
that that distance that's impacting that
 
06:29:46.350 --> 06:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
loon we're we're invading their personal
 
06:29:48.868 --> 06:29:48.878 align:start position:0%
space will typically back up another 10
 
06:29:51.030 --> 06:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
or 20 feet from that and drop the sign
 
06:29:53.190 --> 06:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
right there so our idea in doing this
 
06:29:55.150 --> 06:29:55.160 align:start position:0%
always is that recognizing that Lakes
 
06:29:57.628 --> 06:29:57.638 align:start position:0%
are a public resource we don't want to
 
06:29:59.390 --> 06:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
deny people the use of that public
 
06:30:01.910 --> 06:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
resource for any more water or any
 
06:30:03.910 --> 06:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
longer period of time that is necessary
 
06:30:09.230 --> 06:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:11.628 --> 06:30:11.638 align:start position:0%
successfully thank you very much thank
 
06:30:13.310 --> 06:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
you hearing no other
 
06:30:19.750 --> 06:30:19.760 align:start position:0%

in opposition three
 
06:30:30.230 --> 06:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you very much Mr chairman
 
06:30:32.628 --> 06:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
committee for listening to me my name is
 
06:30:35.830 --> 06:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
Shane Cary and I oppose House Bill 1390
 
06:30:37.830 --> 06:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
I live in boat on pakway lake with my
 
06:30:40.270 --> 06:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
wife and two kids who enjoy recreational
 
06:30:42.310 --> 06:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
water sports I had the pleasure of
 
06:30:44.110 --> 06:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
serving on House Bill
 
06:30:46.670 --> 06:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
137 um which we did a study on Wake
 
06:30:48.548 --> 06:30:48.558 align:start position:0%
boats and I believe that we need to
 
06:30:50.350 --> 06:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
continue on the education on wakes
 
06:30:52.190 --> 06:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
Sports not a
 
06:30:55.030 --> 06:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
band um there's many stories out there
 
06:30:56.750 --> 06:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
education is our number one thing that
 
06:30:59.708 --> 06:30:59.718 align:start position:0%
we need to do these setbacks that we're
 
06:31:01.230 --> 06:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
proposing with this bill will confuse
 
06:31:04.070 --> 06:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
voters cause safety concerns this bill
 
06:31:05.910 --> 06:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
will tax Marine Patrol officers which
 
06:31:08.310 --> 06:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
are already short staffed this house
 
06:31:10.788 --> 06:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
bill 1390 will make it hotter for Marine
 
06:31:12.788 --> 06:31:12.798 align:start position:0%
Patrol to enforce the current laws that
 
06:31:15.150 --> 06:31:15.160 align:start position:0%
are already in place and believe me
 
06:31:16.990 --> 06:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
education is what is needed if you look
 
06:31:18.548 --> 06:31:18.558 align:start position:0%
out there in the Boating
 
06:31:20.948 --> 06:31:20.958 align:start position:0%
industry this bill would be bad for
 
06:31:23.270 --> 06:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
tourism industry as well this bill will
 
06:31:25.110 --> 06:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
cause vacationist to seek other Estates
 
06:31:26.948 --> 06:31:26.958 align:start position:0%
to boat in which would affect small
 
06:31:28.868 --> 06:31:28.878 align:start position:0%
businesses small business depended on
 
06:31:30.788 --> 06:31:30.798 align:start position:0%
the summer tourism and this bill will
 
06:31:34.110 --> 06:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
turn tourists away from this great
 
06:31:36.590 --> 06:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
state this could result in an annual
 
06:31:39.110 --> 06:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
loss of $1.4 billion from recreational
 
06:31:41.830 --> 06:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
boers please do not pass this bill it's
 
06:31:43.868 --> 06:31:43.878 align:start position:0%
too extreme for this great state and
 
06:31:45.750 --> 06:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
will affect more than just water sports
 
06:31:51.230 --> 06:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:55.670 --> 06:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much for quick
 
06:31:57.788 --> 06:31:57.798 align:start position:0%
presentation is there any questions by
 
06:32:00.510 --> 06:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
members of the Committee hearing none
 
06:32:02.910 --> 06:32:02.920 align:start position:0%

my name is David MacDonald I'm the
 
06:32:30.708 --> 06:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
Harbor Master or I was the Harbor Master
 
06:32:33.510 --> 06:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
at the Oakledge homeowners association
 
06:32:39.150 --> 06:32:39.160 align:start position:0%
on fisers Bay on Lake snipe from 2007 to
 
06:32:43.110 --> 06:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
2022 I retired this year I think I aged
 
06:32:47.830 --> 06:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
out um I'd like to talk about some real
 
06:32:49.750 --> 06:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
differences that I've seen in the
 
06:32:52.990 --> 06:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance of our property there having
 
06:32:55.548 --> 06:32:55.558 align:start position:0%
been there for a long time
 
06:32:59.270 --> 06:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
at Oakledge we have 30 Mings and we have
 
06:33:02.788 --> 06:33:02.798 align:start position:0%
two fixed docks one of the fixed docks
 
06:33:05.350 --> 06:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
has five connecting floating docks
 
06:33:10.910 --> 06:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
connected by Steel uh uh fabricated
 
06:33:13.868 --> 06:33:13.878 align:start position:0%
connectors uh we have impacts that we
 
06:33:16.990 --> 06:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
see on the connectors we have impacts
 
06:33:19.548 --> 06:33:19.558 align:start position:0%
that we see on the chains and we have
 
06:33:22.788 --> 06:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
impacts that we see on the moing balls
 
06:33:25.430 --> 06:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
first of all the chains
 
06:33:28.750 --> 06:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
um the last several years we have been
 
06:33:31.910 --> 06:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
replacing more and more chain for
 
06:33:33.750 --> 06:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
example in
 
06:33:36.070 --> 06:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
2018 to
 
06:33:42.030 --> 06:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
2020 3 years we averaged around 39 ft of
 
06:33:42.040 --> 06:33:43.388 align:start position:0%
2020 3 years we averaged around 39 ft of
replaced

06:33:43.388 --> 06:33:43.398 align:start position:0%
replaced
 
06:33:43.398 --> 06:33:45.590 align:start position:0%
replaced
chain

06:33:45.590 --> 06:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
chain
 
06:33:47.990 --> 06:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
2021 and
 
06:33:52.270 --> 06:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
2022 we averaged over 100 fet of
 
06:33:55.548 --> 06:33:55.558 align:start position:0%
replaced chains now what happens in
 
06:34:01.110 --> 06:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
fiser Bay is it's about 2,000 ft wide
 
06:34:03.910 --> 06:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
but we get this going on around and
 
06:34:06.510 --> 06:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
around and around and we're getting more
 
06:34:10.430 --> 06:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
and more uh wake boats I've got five
 
06:34:14.230 --> 06:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
okay of my 32 I've got five so I
 
06:34:16.910 --> 06:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
understand that but those people aren't
 
06:34:19.430 --> 06:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
the problem they've been
 
06:34:22.548 --> 06:34:22.558 align:start position:0%
told now in addition to the problems we
 
06:34:24.150 --> 06:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
got with the chains I have the moing
 
06:34:24.160 --> 06:34:25.948 align:start position:0%
got with the chains I have the moing
ball

06:34:25.948 --> 06:34:25.958 align:start position:0%
ball
 
06:34:29.510 --> 06:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh in the last 4 years we've had to
 
06:34:34.708 --> 06:34:34.718 align:start position:0%
replace 18 moing balls that's half of
 
06:34:39.310 --> 06:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
what we got that's despite going from
 
06:34:43.750 --> 06:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
half inch steel to 5/8 in
 
06:34:46.868 --> 06:34:46.878 align:start position:0%
steel that's a problem and now there are
 
06:34:50.110 --> 06:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
the dot connectors we have eight dock
 
06:34:52.910 --> 06:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
connectors connecting the five
 
06:34:56.910 --> 06:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
docks last year year or in
 
06:35:00.190 --> 06:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
2022 we had to replace three of those
 
06:35:03.230 --> 06:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
connectors each connector is fabricated
 
06:35:04.830 --> 06:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
it cost
 
06:35:07.990 --> 06:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
$600 that's really expensive and to go
 
06:35:10.708 --> 06:35:10.718 align:start position:0%
through three in one year is
 
06:35:14.868 --> 06:35:14.878 align:start position:0%
crazy normally it's one or
 
06:35:17.788 --> 06:35:17.798 align:start position:0%
zero now what have we tried to do to
 
06:35:19.830 --> 06:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
mitigate this we've gone to bigger
 
06:35:22.628 --> 06:35:22.638 align:start position:0%
Hardware already now we're going to
 
06:35:25.190 --> 06:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
stainless steel stainless steel chains
 
06:35:28.388 --> 06:35:28.398 align:start position:0%
three times as much and stainless steel
 
06:35:30.350 --> 06:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
going through the moing ball is another
 
06:35:34.788 --> 06:35:34.798 align:start position:0%
50 bucks so it's it's it's getting
 
06:35:37.270 --> 06:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
really expensive for us to maintain our
 
06:35:40.110 --> 06:35:40.120 align:start position:0%
moing field and our docks in addition of
 
06:35:42.788 --> 06:35:42.798 align:start position:0%
course we see the boats rocking against
 
06:35:45.230 --> 06:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
the moing balls when these waves come
 
06:35:48.070 --> 06:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
through and this isn't the the speed
 
06:35:51.468 --> 06:35:51.478 align:start position:0%
boats with the uh water skiers this is
 
06:35:54.590 --> 06:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
the wave boats and as preponderantly the
 
06:35:56.868 --> 06:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
ones that just keep circling
 
06:36:01.110 --> 06:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
around uh so we definitely are in in uh
 
06:36:04.868 --> 06:36:04.878 align:start position:0%
favor of 1390 we think it's a good bill
 
06:36:07.510 --> 06:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
it will definitely help something has
 
06:36:10.750 --> 06:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
got to be done to mitigate the damage
 
06:36:12.590 --> 06:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
not only to the Shoreline which a lot of
 
06:36:14.270 --> 06:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
other people have been talking about to
 
06:36:16.868 --> 06:36:16.878 align:start position:0%
the damage of our property so thank you
 
06:36:16.878 --> 06:36:18.110 align:start position:0%
the damage of our property so thank you
for

06:36:18.110 --> 06:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:36:22.270 --> 06:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:26.350 --> 06:36:26.360 align:start position:0%
speaker see none thank you for your your
 
06:36:28.910 --> 06:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
testimony next up against the bill
 
06:36:39.310 --> 06:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:41.590 --> 06:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
lysing Jody I couldn't hear you they're
 
06:36:43.150 --> 06:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
out of the room but they're coming back
 
06:36:45.750 --> 06:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
is that what you
 
06:36:48.670 --> 06:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
said okay so we'll go to another one
 
06:36:52.590 --> 06:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:54.830 --> 06:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
Gerson we're making a lot of money on
 
06:36:54.840 --> 06:36:56.868 align:start position:0%
Gerson we're making a lot of money on
the

06:36:56.868 --> 06:36:56.878 align:start position:0%

06:37:04.910 --> 06:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:06.910 --> 06:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
Nigro yeah I don't need it thank you
 
06:37:08.750 --> 06:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
though uh good afternoon ladies and
 
06:37:10.430 --> 06:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
gentlemen thank you for hearing my
 
06:37:12.548 --> 06:37:12.558 align:start position:0%
testimony today uh my name is Brett
 
06:37:15.190 --> 06:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
Nigro from Windam New Hampshire I reside
 
06:37:18.310 --> 06:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
on kobitz Pond um disappointed to say my
 
06:37:19.628 --> 06:37:19.638 align:start position:0%
daughters had to leave them just a few
 
06:37:21.150 --> 06:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
moments ago they were excited to be a
 
06:37:23.830 --> 06:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
part of this Democratic process and um
 
06:37:26.788 --> 06:37:26.798 align:start position:0%
had to leave for for practice so um that
 
06:37:28.310 --> 06:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
disappoints me as well cuz I wanted them
 
06:37:31.468 --> 06:37:31.478 align:start position:0%
to see this uh through to the end um the
 
06:37:33.468 --> 06:37:33.478 align:start position:0%
other reason I wanted them here is is
 
06:37:35.150 --> 06:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
one of the core parenting principles
 
06:37:37.430 --> 06:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
that my wife and I instill in these two
 
06:37:40.430 --> 06:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
is to stand up for what they believe in
 
06:37:42.708 --> 06:37:42.718 align:start position:0%
and to fight an injustice if they
 
06:37:44.270 --> 06:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
believe there is one in a courteous
 
06:37:46.070 --> 06:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
respectful and most importantly factual
 
06:37:49.270 --> 06:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
manner we as a family and my friend
 
06:37:51.030 --> 06:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
group that have joined me here today
 
06:37:53.388 --> 06:37:53.398 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose this bill we feel that
 
06:37:55.750 --> 06:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
it is a uh tremendous
 
06:37:59.150 --> 06:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
overreach um for a perceived problem
 
06:38:00.708 --> 06:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
that as many times you may have heard
 
06:38:02.230 --> 06:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
that our studies on this side of the
 
06:38:05.070 --> 06:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
bill don't support uh there's equal
 
06:38:07.590 --> 06:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
equally as many holes that can be shot
 
06:38:09.910 --> 06:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
into their proposed science the reality
 
06:38:12.510 --> 06:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
is uh studies are bought and paid for by
 
06:38:15.310 --> 06:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
someone and data can be manipulated to
 
06:38:16.990 --> 06:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
produce whatever outcomes that the
 
06:38:20.190 --> 06:38:20.200 align:start position:0%
agenda of the payer has in front of them
 
06:38:21.548 --> 06:38:21.558 align:start position:0%
let's look at our friends at Google that
 
06:38:23.750 --> 06:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
just manipulated the the skin tone of
 
06:38:25.270 --> 06:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
people because that's the way that their
 
06:38:27.310 --> 06:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
politics work so uh it's a little
 
06:38:30.070 --> 06:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
frustrating to be a property owner um
 
06:38:31.830 --> 06:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
I've been on my Lake Association for 12
 
06:38:34.150 --> 06:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
years I'm one term removed from our Lake
 
06:38:36.990 --> 06:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
presidency um intally knowledge of the
 
06:38:40.190 --> 06:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
the the struggle between uh the uninform
 
06:38:42.868 --> 06:38:42.878 align:start position:0%
Wake boo opposition and those of us that
 
06:38:46.628 --> 06:38:46.638 align:start position:0%
perform wake boating um I could rebut
 
06:38:48.310 --> 06:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
90% of the things that were said here
 
06:38:49.708 --> 06:38:49.718 align:start position:0%
today but we have a time limit so I'm
 
06:38:52.150 --> 06:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
going to focus my my testimony on the
 
06:38:54.230 --> 06:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
education versus legislation component
 
06:38:56.388 --> 06:38:56.398 align:start position:0%
put together just a a quick color slide
 
06:38:58.468 --> 06:38:58.478 align:start position:0%
for you guys because I think uh you're
 
06:39:00.910 --> 06:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
probably mostly non-voters thank you
 
06:39:03.310 --> 06:39:03.320 align:start position:0%
voters rather and a quick picture could
 
06:39:05.548 --> 06:39:05.558 align:start position:0%
demonstrate uh to you a lot easier than
 
06:39:08.510 --> 06:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
a bunch of words um what's in being
 
06:39:10.350 --> 06:39:10.360 align:start position:0%
circulated uh I'll wait for it to get
 
06:39:12.708 --> 06:39:12.718 align:start position:0%
around the precursor to that is there is
 
06:39:14.708 --> 06:39:14.718 align:start position:0%
a lack of Education this is a relatively
 
06:39:16.830 --> 06:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
new activity uh one that's very
 
06:39:18.310 --> 06:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
meaningful as you heard the passionate
 
06:39:20.510 --> 06:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
testimony of a lot of folks on this Lake
 
06:39:24.230 --> 06:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
I mean on this topic um and with that
 
06:39:27.190 --> 06:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
education is in order and with some best
 
06:39:29.270 --> 06:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
practices and some pragmatic and
 
06:39:31.670 --> 06:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable approaches to that education
 
06:39:33.708 --> 06:39:33.718 align:start position:0%
we can solve Andor mitigate the majority
 
06:39:36.430 --> 06:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
of the concerns by the opposition if we
 
06:39:38.030 --> 06:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
can get that passed around I can Hur
 
06:39:40.070 --> 06:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
this up
 
06:39:43.230 --> 06:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
um you know the the reality is the the
 
06:39:45.750 --> 06:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
the Wake booat study that compared the
 
06:39:47.990 --> 06:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
ski booat to the wake booat is
 
06:39:49.628 --> 06:39:49.638 align:start position:0%
inconclusive it was one pass in each
 
06:39:51.750 --> 06:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
Direction and two totally inop
 
06:39:55.388 --> 06:39:55.398 align:start position:0%
incomparable boats throw a big V Hole uh
 
06:39:57.310 --> 06:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
boat on there and you'll see much
 
06:40:01.110 --> 06:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
different uh comparable waves and you
 
06:40:03.548 --> 06:40:03.558 align:start position:0%
know just it goes back to my study
 
06:40:05.350 --> 06:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
comparison so I'm not uh Choosing My
 
06:40:07.350 --> 06:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
Words great at the moment but let's
 
06:40:08.788 --> 06:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
let's get on to the slide what you have
 
06:40:11.070 --> 06:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
in front of you is just an aerial view
 
06:40:13.350 --> 06:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
of a wake booat uh that's producing a
 
06:40:14.750 --> 06:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
wave so at the very bottom you'll see
 
06:40:16.708 --> 06:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
the tail end of the of the boat itself
 
06:40:19.310 --> 06:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
at the very top caned is a rider that is
 
06:40:21.190 --> 06:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
surfing the wave and what I wanted to
 
06:40:23.150 --> 06:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
point out to you folks that this is one
 
06:40:25.110 --> 06:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
of many best traes that can help
 
06:40:27.708 --> 06:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
mitigate Andor eliminate the the wave
 
06:40:30.468 --> 06:40:30.478 align:start position:0%
energy being directed towards the shore
 
06:40:32.350 --> 06:40:32.360 align:start position:0%
the way these boats are operated there
 
06:40:34.350 --> 06:40:34.360 align:start position:0%
is a mechanical mechanism that yaws the
 
06:40:36.628 --> 06:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
boat to the side uh unlike what everyone
 
06:40:38.310 --> 06:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
is testifying here it doesn't tip it way
 
06:40:39.628 --> 06:40:39.638 align:start position:0%
up and bring the propeller closer to the
 
06:40:42.030 --> 06:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
bottom it yws it to the side it uses the
 
06:40:44.110 --> 06:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
device to create the wave which
 
06:40:45.628 --> 06:40:45.638 align:start position:0%
basically steals the energy from one
 
06:40:47.750 --> 06:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
side of the boat and directs it onto the
 
06:40:50.150 --> 06:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
other side and creates the wave to ride
 
06:40:52.230 --> 06:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
on what you see on the left side is the
 
06:40:56.270 --> 06:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
wash side of the boat okay and the wash
 
06:40:58.910 --> 06:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
side is mostly air bubbles as a result
 
06:41:00.510 --> 06:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
of the energy being stolen from one side
 
06:41:03.350 --> 06:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
and put on the other side okay the best
 
06:41:04.628 --> 06:41:04.638 align:start position:0%
way I can describe it in layman's terms
 
06:41:06.190 --> 06:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
is you go to the beach the wave that's
 
06:41:07.830 --> 06:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
coming off the ocean is much stronger
 
06:41:10.030 --> 06:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
when it's a wall of water but by the
 
06:41:12.110 --> 06:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
time it crashes and all the wave energy
 
06:41:13.788 --> 06:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
is dissipated and the air comes up and
 
06:41:15.548 --> 06:41:15.558 align:start position:0%
it tickles your toes there's nothing to
 
06:41:18.868 --> 06:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
it so as a responsible wake booat
 
06:41:21.510 --> 06:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
Operator by having my girls were here
 
06:41:23.070 --> 06:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
cuz we had a demonstration plan for you
 
06:41:24.910 --> 06:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
but if there riding on the on the left
 
06:41:26.990 --> 06:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
side of the wave and therefore the wash
 
06:41:28.430 --> 06:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
side is on the right side of the wave if
 
06:41:29.910 --> 06:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
you put the shoreline on the right side
 
06:41:32.430 --> 06:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
as you're going up the wave energy is
 
06:41:34.030 --> 06:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
pushed towards the center of the of of
 
06:41:36.830 --> 06:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
the lake same thing's true coming back a
 
06:41:39.270 --> 06:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
responsible owner recognizes that you
 
06:41:41.150 --> 06:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
just simply reverse the process and move
 
06:41:42.750 --> 06:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
the energy towards the center of the
 
06:41:45.230 --> 06:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
lake that's one of probably 10 different
 
06:41:46.788 --> 06:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
best practices including that power
 
06:41:48.830 --> 06:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
turning to pick up your Riders which
 
06:41:50.510 --> 06:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
means slowing down and coming around in
 
06:41:52.750 --> 06:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
the fair and reasonable manner so with a
 
06:41:54.830 --> 06:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
little education and a little bit of
 
06:41:56.350 --> 06:41:56.360 align:start position:0%
cooperation and I heard one of the
 
06:41:57.948 --> 06:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
representatives there and I appreciated
 
06:42:01.110 --> 06:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
the tone of cooperation and and
 
06:42:02.948 --> 06:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
compromise we can come to something that
 
06:42:05.070 --> 06:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
makes sense and I think the the Senate
 
06:42:07.468 --> 06:42:07.478 align:start position:0%
Bill 431 bill is a great step in that
 
06:42:09.190 --> 06:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
direction and if we double down on
 
06:42:11.350 --> 06:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
education which includes and I put the
 
06:42:13.708 --> 06:42:13.718 align:start position:0%
link on the bottom of my slide please
 
06:42:15.468 --> 06:42:15.478 align:start position:0%
take a look at the current New Hampshire
 
06:42:17.468 --> 06:42:17.478 align:start position:0%
boers guide there is not one mention of
 
06:42:18.990 --> 06:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
any sort of best practices as it relates
 
06:42:20.510 --> 06:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
to wake Sports they've been around for
 
06:42:23.150 --> 06:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
close to 20 years why is that if it's
 
06:42:24.990 --> 06:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
such a problem why has it never been
 
06:42:27.190 --> 06:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
addressed let's address the problem at
 
06:42:28.830 --> 06:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
the source as people are getting their
 
06:42:30.708 --> 06:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
license and there's other mechanisms for
 
06:42:32.190 --> 06:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
which to get the information out there
 
06:42:34.190 --> 06:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
so what I'm imploring imploring that you
 
06:42:36.590 --> 06:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
folks do is recognize that this is the
 
06:42:38.910 --> 06:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
nuclear option that's going to a
 
06:42:41.548 --> 06:42:41.558 align:start position:0%
prohibit me on cage Pond from using my
 
06:42:43.510 --> 06:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
very expensive boat and depreciate my my
 
06:42:45.388 --> 06:42:45.398 align:start position:0%
value but it's not just about me it's
 
06:42:47.750 --> 06:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
about other families across the the area
 
06:42:49.350 --> 06:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to be greatly impacted by
 
06:42:51.388 --> 06:42:51.398 align:start position:0%
this and it may seem trivial or nominal
 
06:42:52.868 --> 06:42:52.878 align:start position:0%
to some because it's a small percentage
 
06:42:54.510 --> 06:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
of the boting population
 
06:42:58.270 --> 06:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
but but B activity is a mentality that
 
06:43:00.948 --> 06:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
you know is family oriented by its
 
06:43:03.310 --> 06:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
nature these are valuable times raising
 
06:43:05.270 --> 06:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
kids in difficult times and I can get
 
06:43:07.110 --> 06:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
them captive on a boat for two hours
 
06:43:09.430 --> 06:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
without a scream and and and do the same
 
06:43:11.990 --> 06:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
thing when I'm skiing to New Hampshire
 
06:43:13.948 --> 06:43:13.958 align:start position:0%
Staples that gives me the ability to be
 
06:43:15.830 --> 06:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
a good father and please don't take that
 
06:43:17.708 --> 06:43:17.718 align:start position:0%
away from us there's many many many of
 
06:43:19.070 --> 06:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
us that are out there doing the right
 
06:43:20.750 --> 06:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
thing and a couple bad people that
 
06:43:22.388 --> 06:43:22.398 align:start position:0%
created a wave so Dave bundell got
 
06:43:25.070 --> 06:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
knocked off his chair
 
06:43:27.190 --> 06:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
we don't need to do legislation let's
 
06:43:29.430 --> 06:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
start with a reasonable bill with
 
06:43:31.990 --> 06:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable educational methods and let's
 
06:43:33.350 --> 06:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
let's see where it goes you can always
 
06:43:35.030 --> 06:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
go up we're never going to be able to go
 
06:43:39.110 --> 06:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
down please vote no on this Bill thank
 
06:43:41.708 --> 06:43:41.718 align:start position:0%
you any questions for the speaker uh yes
 
06:43:44.030 --> 06:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
I do Mr chair go ahead go ahead thank
 
06:43:47.070 --> 06:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for your testimony um
 
06:43:48.310 --> 06:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that there are some
 
06:43:50.350 --> 06:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
studies that were bought and paid for
 
06:43:52.708 --> 06:43:52.718 align:start position:0%
and we've got dozens to go through can
 
06:43:56.430 --> 06:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
you li list any or specific ones that
 
06:43:58.190 --> 06:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
sure the Minnesota study that the the
 
06:44:00.310 --> 06:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
gentleman uh referenced earlier where
 
06:44:01.910 --> 06:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
there was a competition Skibo going in
 
06:44:03.590 --> 06:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
One Direction and a wake booat come in
 
06:44:04.990 --> 06:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
the other and it was you know a
 
06:44:07.670 --> 06:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
percentage differential in terms of wave
 
06:44:11.110 --> 06:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh wave strength U that bill that that
 
06:44:13.190 --> 06:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
study had boats going two passes one
 
06:44:14.670 --> 06:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
this way one that way very quick
 
06:44:16.708 --> 06:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
measurements it wasn't a very wellth
 
06:44:18.788 --> 06:44:18.798 align:start position:0%
thought out study and it didn't use a
 
06:44:20.948 --> 06:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
variety of different boat types it used
 
06:44:23.270 --> 06:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
a competition ski boat was a flat hle
 
06:44:25.310 --> 06:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
that skims across the water designed
 
06:44:28.150 --> 06:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
specifically to make no wave at all so
 
06:44:29.910 --> 06:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
that the skiers can ski back
 
06:44:32.230 --> 06:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
effortlessly at very high speeds it's a
 
06:44:33.628 --> 06:44:33.638 align:start position:0%
very different mechanism than anything
 
06:44:35.750 --> 06:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
else including your little cabin Cy or
 
06:44:38.030 --> 06:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
any sort of vhole boat that may be uh
 
06:44:40.350 --> 06:44:40.360 align:start position:0%
traversing our our waterways so the
 
06:44:42.150 --> 06:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
study on its face it's like I'm picking
 
06:44:44.750 --> 06:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
the extreme to to validate my my
 
06:44:47.150 --> 06:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
position on the Other Extreme it's it's
 
06:44:49.230 --> 06:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
just not a good study it it it shouldn't
 
06:44:51.590 --> 06:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
impact your your position on this bill
 
06:44:53.190 --> 06:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
what should is how this affects New
 
06:44:55.230 --> 06:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families and you could tell by
 
06:44:57.270 --> 06:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
how enraged I am at the moment this imp
 
06:45:00.150 --> 06:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
impacts my family greatly okay so just
 
06:45:02.670 --> 06:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
that one steady let's talk about them
 
06:45:03.948 --> 06:45:03.958 align:start position:0%
all if you want we can run through them
 
06:45:06.150 --> 06:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
one by one there's not enough
 
06:45:07.990 --> 06:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
information to Warrant an outright ban
 
06:45:09.750 --> 06:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
on I don't know what the number is 25%
 
06:45:11.590 --> 06:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire Lakes on my Lake it's
 
06:45:13.548 --> 06:45:13.558 align:start position:0%
going to put it in a 177% section in the
 
06:45:16.510 --> 06:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
center we have approximately 20 W wake
 
06:45:18.830 --> 06:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
boats on our on our Lake several of them
 
06:45:20.310 --> 06:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
are here today because they care enough
 
06:45:23.628 --> 06:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
to be here we're responsible fathers I'm
 
06:45:25.750 --> 06:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
53 years old I have two kids I've
 
06:45:28.070 --> 06:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
probably taught 30 to 50 kids how to
 
06:45:30.868 --> 06:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
wake surf We Gather as a community it is
 
06:45:32.990 --> 06:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
a community sport yeah are there are
 
06:45:35.468 --> 06:45:35.478 align:start position:0%
people that are bad drivers sure I saw
 
06:45:36.628 --> 06:45:36.638 align:start position:0%
probably three of them coming up here on
 
06:45:36.638 --> 06:45:38.430 align:start position:0%
probably three of them coming up here on
93

06:45:38.430 --> 06:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
93
 
06:45:41.510 --> 06:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
so don't punish the masses by the the
 
06:45:42.948 --> 06:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
the poor actions of ref few and the
 
06:45:45.750 --> 06:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
easily offended what I'm suggesting is
 
06:45:47.430 --> 06:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
because of the newness of what's going
 
06:45:49.750 --> 06:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
on here the newness of the sport and the
 
06:45:51.388 --> 06:45:51.398 align:start position:0%
newness of the need for regulation for
 
06:45:54.270 --> 06:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
which I support I'm not going to want to
 
06:45:56.190 --> 06:45:56.200 align:start position:0%
create erosion on my Lake I've sat on
 
06:45:58.750 --> 06:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
that board for 12 years the bigger
 
06:46:01.468 --> 06:46:01.478 align:start position:0%
problem is is development and is rain
 
06:46:03.910 --> 06:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
rainwater runoff that brings s sediment
 
06:46:05.990 --> 06:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
into our Lakes our Lakes water quality
 
06:46:07.830 --> 06:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
is is a disaster right now because of
 
06:46:09.230 --> 06:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
the blasting associated with the moving
 
06:46:11.868 --> 06:46:11.878 align:start position:0%
of 93 closer to our Lake and all the
 
06:46:13.670 --> 06:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
storm water runoff that brings Brine and
 
06:46:15.628 --> 06:46:15.638 align:start position:0%
salt that's what's the real problem in
 
06:46:16.788 --> 06:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
our Lake if you want to do something
 
06:46:19.150 --> 06:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
with 500 ft why don't we ban fertilizer
 
06:46:21.830 --> 06:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
use on our lawns in 500 ft our water
 
06:46:23.628 --> 06:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
quality guy was just here he' support
 
06:46:25.310 --> 06:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
that even though he's firmly against you
 
06:46:27.270 --> 06:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
know in support of this bill there are
 
06:46:29.948 --> 06:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
better ways to spend your time and ours
 
06:46:31.990 --> 06:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
for the betterment of our Lakes than to
 
06:46:34.468 --> 06:46:34.478 align:start position:0%
press the nuclear button this is very
 
06:46:36.708 --> 06:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
very concerning to me as a culture on a
 
06:46:38.910 --> 06:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
national level the first
 
06:46:42.510 --> 06:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
reaction is to label restrict in an
 
06:46:44.350 --> 06:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
effort to ban you see it on regular
 
06:46:47.070 --> 06:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
media social media written print it's
 
06:46:48.948 --> 06:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
it's always the extreme and I'm
 
06:46:51.270 --> 06:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
suggesting as New Hampshire residents
 
06:46:53.510 --> 06:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
that we're different we don't need to go
 
06:46:55.388 --> 06:46:55.398 align:start position:0%
to extremes we have to have trust in our
 
06:46:57.388 --> 06:46:57.398 align:start position:0%
residents to come up with a plan that
 
06:46:59.910 --> 06:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense and a plan that is something
 
06:47:01.990 --> 06:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
that we can all adopt and if everyone
 
06:47:03.868 --> 06:47:03.878 align:start position:0%
feels a little pain and we come to a
 
06:47:05.830 --> 06:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
compromise well I'll be in a better
 
06:47:07.830 --> 06:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
place but I promise you if this bill
 
06:47:10.628 --> 06:47:10.638 align:start position:0%
goes through the pain is lopsided it's
 
06:47:13.070 --> 06:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
unjust and there will be huge rep you
 
06:47:15.230 --> 06:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
know repercussions my property value
 
06:47:17.190 --> 06:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
will plummet immensely there's two lakes
 
06:47:19.468 --> 06:47:19.478 align:start position:0%
in my town one doesn't allow motorboats
 
06:47:22.350 --> 06:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
the other one does there's a 30 to 40%
 
06:47:23.548 --> 06:47:23.558 align:start position:0%
pricing differential between between the
 
06:47:24.910 --> 06:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
two lakes in the same town same school
 
06:47:26.548 --> 06:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
system same awesome amenities that
 
06:47:29.150 --> 06:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
Windom offers the price differential is
 
06:47:31.670 --> 06:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
immense why is that because families
 
06:47:34.030 --> 06:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
gravitate on their boats and this is how
 
06:47:36.948 --> 06:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
we raise good respectful confident young
 
06:47:38.388 --> 06:47:38.398 align:start position:0%
adults that's going to lead this country
 
06:47:38.398 --> 06:47:39.430 align:start position:0%
adults that's going to lead this country
going

06:47:39.430 --> 06:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
going
 
06:47:41.548 --> 06:47:41.558 align:start position:0%
forward we lose this I lose them to
 
06:47:43.110 --> 06:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
screens I lose them to all the outside
 
06:47:45.948 --> 06:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
influences we need this we can be
 
06:47:49.110 --> 06:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
responsible we want the protection of
 
06:47:51.510 --> 06:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
our Lakes as well this talk about the
 
06:47:54.310 --> 06:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
Wake boats causing the sett issues
 
06:47:56.190 --> 06:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
that's just not accurate you can't
 
06:47:58.468 --> 06:47:58.478 align:start position:0%
produce a reasonable size Surf Wave in
 
06:48:00.350 --> 06:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
shallow water you can't you're
 
06:48:02.270 --> 06:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
displacing water the only way to do it
 
06:48:04.388 --> 06:48:04.398 align:start position:0%
is in the deep water I'm sorry the New
 
06:48:05.830 --> 06:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes lady went on forever so
 
06:48:06.910 --> 06:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take my time if you don't
 
06:48:09.388 --> 06:48:09.398 align:start position:0%
mind ma' well I actually was just going
 
06:48:11.430 --> 06:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
to ask you if you could wrap up your
 
06:48:13.388 --> 06:48:13.398 align:start position:0%
answer cuz it looks like you're taking
 
06:48:15.070 --> 06:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
another 10 minut to make but I need to
 
06:48:17.150 --> 06:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
refute this point the sediment caused by
 
06:48:18.510 --> 06:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
wake boats because they are occasional
 
06:48:20.310 --> 06:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
use and they're and they're operated by
 
06:48:22.750 --> 06:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable older adults that take take
 
06:48:24.310 --> 06:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
Direction fairly well aside from the
 
06:48:28.110 --> 06:48:28.120 align:start position:0%
time limit um that you'd have to make
 
06:48:30.150 --> 06:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
waves in deep water or it doesn't work
 
06:48:32.070 --> 06:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
so this this concept of us going in
 
06:48:34.190 --> 06:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
shallow water is ridiculous it doesn't
 
06:48:35.548 --> 06:48:35.558 align:start position:0%
work the science isn't there you want to
 
06:48:37.030 --> 06:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
talk about science you have to be in the
 
06:48:40.388 --> 06:48:40.398 align:start position:0%
deep water so just please hear my words
 
06:48:42.430 --> 06:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
this is a a bigger issue than it may
 
06:48:44.070 --> 06:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
appear on its face you're impacting
 
06:48:45.670 --> 06:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
families across the state and I implore
 
06:48:48.030 --> 06:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
you to vote no and embrace education and
 
06:48:49.990 --> 06:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
embrace that other bill with a 200 foot
 
06:48:51.310 --> 06:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
setback and let's see what that takes us
 
06:48:52.468 --> 06:48:52.478 align:start position:0%
and they can come back in another two
 
06:48:53.990 --> 06:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
years and we can have this discussion
 
06:49:01.468 --> 06:49:01.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:04.190 --> 06:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
you in support of the bill Valerie
 
06:49:04.200 --> 06:49:10.830 align:start position:0%
you in support of the bill Valerie

06:49:35.110 --> 06:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
okay okay you can hear me okay thank you
 
06:49:36.990 --> 06:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
06:49:40.830 --> 06:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
committee Reps for your service to New
 
06:49:45.070 --> 06:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's a big job and I thank you
 
06:49:49.190 --> 06:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to speak in favor of HB
 
06:49:51.788 --> 06:49:51.798 align:start position:0%
1390 and I'm going to attest to and
 
06:49:54.030 --> 06:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
speak to things that I have personally
 
06:49:57.310 --> 06:49:57.320 align:start position:0%
observed living on the lake for Summers
 
06:50:01.350 --> 06:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
for my 74 years and the last 27 years
 
06:50:04.350 --> 06:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
full-time on the lake and this is Lake
 
06:50:07.270 --> 06:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
spafford I have personally seen the
 
06:50:10.030 --> 06:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
damage that wake surfing has had on
 
06:50:13.190 --> 06:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
spafford Lake's natural habitat from the
 
06:50:16.110 --> 06:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
huge wave it produces sit on my front
 
06:50:18.948 --> 06:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
porch and watch it happen as Lake
 
06:50:22.350 --> 06:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
spafford loon monitor I have seen
 
06:50:25.430 --> 06:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
firsthand and waves from the wakeboard
 
06:50:28.628 --> 06:50:28.638 align:start position:0%
boat sweep up and over the lon nests
 
06:50:31.270 --> 06:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
containing eggs shocking The Loon
 
06:50:34.388 --> 06:50:34.398 align:start position:0%
sitting in the nest and throwing her off
 
06:50:38.350 --> 06:50:38.360 align:start position:0%
um I am the one at the lake who I'm loon
 
06:50:40.990 --> 06:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
Monitor and I put out the buoys I
 
06:50:43.868 --> 06:50:43.878 align:start position:0%
therefore increased when I saw this and
 
06:50:46.788 --> 06:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
noticed it because it was on the island
 
06:50:48.948 --> 06:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
and the boats um think that because
 
06:50:51.110 --> 06:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
there is no building on the island and
 
06:50:53.590 --> 06:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
very not that much use that they can
 
06:50:57.070 --> 06:50:57.080 align:start position:0%
come closer to the island and I moved
 
06:51:00.468 --> 06:51:00.478 align:start position:0%
the buoys out farther to about 100 ft to
 
06:51:02.510 --> 06:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
know problems for the rest of the people
 
06:51:05.910 --> 06:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
on the lake I have seen firsthand waves
 
06:51:08.788 --> 06:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
from these boats Pummel the shoreline
 
06:51:11.030 --> 06:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
and eat away at the soil around
 
06:51:14.430 --> 06:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
vegetation and Roots I have seen
 
06:51:18.190 --> 06:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
firsthand kayakers going fairly close to
 
06:51:22.310 --> 06:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
shore within a 100 feet um that were
 
06:51:24.788 --> 06:51:24.798 align:start position:0%
placed in Jeopardy uh because these
 
06:51:27.628 --> 06:51:27.638 align:start position:0%
boats have come too close uh I have
 
06:51:30.990 --> 06:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
witnessed outbreaks of CYO bacteria for
 
06:51:34.310 --> 06:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
several years which may be may be
 
06:51:37.350 --> 06:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
attributed in some part to deep wave
 
06:51:39.628 --> 06:51:39.638 align:start position:0%
action loosening the masses on the
 
06:51:41.990 --> 06:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
bottom of the lake I know it's not the
 
06:51:45.350 --> 06:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
root cause but I think it contributes to
 
06:51:48.628 --> 06:51:48.638 align:start position:0%
the uh PL the masses coming to the
 
06:51:50.670 --> 06:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
surface and then floating into
 
06:51:53.910 --> 06:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
Shore the the bill is very important and
 
06:51:55.948 --> 06:51:55.958 align:start position:0%
I would it would not prohibit the sport
 
06:51:58.468 --> 06:51:58.478 align:start position:0%
on many of our larger Lakes including
 
06:52:00.868 --> 06:52:00.878 align:start position:0%
Lake spafford we have plenty of acreage
 
06:52:03.468 --> 06:52:03.478 align:start position:0%
almost 900 acres and there's plenty of
 
06:52:06.788 --> 06:52:06.798 align:start position:0%
lake that could support wake surfing
 
06:52:10.150 --> 06:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
sports but there um it may prohibit the
 
06:52:12.868 --> 06:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
sport on some smaller Lakes but those
 
06:52:16.070 --> 06:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
Lakes can be in serious Peril if we
 
06:52:18.628 --> 06:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
continue to ignore the facts and the
 
06:52:21.910 --> 06:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
science behind the damaged oversized
 
06:52:24.430 --> 06:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
that oversized waves can
 
06:52:26.750 --> 06:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
cause as I said I have summered on
 
06:52:29.190 --> 06:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
spford Lake my whole life and the last
 
06:52:31.868 --> 06:52:31.878 align:start position:0%
27 years full-time to my
 
06:52:34.868 --> 06:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
dismay I have seen our
 
06:52:37.948 --> 06:52:37.958 align:start position:0%
Waters become increasingly unhealthy due
 
06:52:43.510 --> 06:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
to overuse overbuilding and under caring
 
06:52:46.548 --> 06:52:46.558 align:start position:0%
I'm sad to say that we are not alone I
 
06:52:48.830 --> 06:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
don't know of any New Hampshire lake
 
06:52:51.868 --> 06:52:51.878 align:start position:0%
that is healthier today than 25 years
 
06:52:54.430 --> 06:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
ago and if there is one I love to know
 
06:52:57.670 --> 06:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
what it is why we have taken several
 
06:53:00.030 --> 06:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
measures to protect our Lakes like the
 
06:53:02.468 --> 06:53:02.478 align:start position:0%
Shoreland protection act thanks to the
 
06:53:05.230 --> 06:53:05.240 align:start position:0%
legislative body for approving that but
 
06:53:07.910 --> 06:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
as new threats appear we need to address
 
06:53:09.388 --> 06:53:09.398 align:start position:0%
these as
 
06:53:11.788 --> 06:53:11.798 align:start position:0%
well understandably we may be timid
 
06:53:14.190 --> 06:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
about taking necessary actions to
 
06:53:15.948 --> 06:53:15.958 align:start position:0%
protect our New Hampshire Lakes because
 
06:53:18.830 --> 06:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
it can upset and does upset some people
 
06:53:22.070 --> 06:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
who may be adversely impacted however
 
06:53:24.310 --> 06:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
don't we we have an obligation we
 
06:53:26.590 --> 06:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
collectively have an obligation to make
 
06:53:29.030 --> 06:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
those hard decisions if it's the right
 
06:53:32.070 --> 06:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
decision you not only represent people
 
06:53:34.670 --> 06:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
but you represent the habitats that do
 
06:53:35.868 --> 06:53:35.878 align:start position:0%
not have a
 
06:53:38.750 --> 06:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
voice those of us who use our Lakes
 
06:53:42.310 --> 06:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
today are here but for a very short time
 
06:53:44.270 --> 06:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
we all need to think first of the
 
06:53:47.230 --> 06:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
lakes's long-term health and rather than
 
06:53:49.948 --> 06:53:49.958 align:start position:0%
our own personal interest we should all
 
06:53:52.830 --> 06:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
be stewards of our beautiful lakes and
 
06:53:56.030 --> 06:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
work to fix issues quickly and
 
06:53:58.150 --> 06:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
definitively please move this bill
 
06:54:00.990 --> 06:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
forward as one action to bring help
 
06:54:03.190 --> 06:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
bring our Lakes back to Good Health
 
06:54:05.350 --> 06:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
before it's too late our next
 
06:54:09.468 --> 06:54:09.478 align:start position:0%
Generations are counting on us and as a
 
06:54:12.868 --> 06:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
side note I live right on the shoreline
 
06:54:15.830 --> 06:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
with very large windows I have never
 
06:54:19.270 --> 06:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
ever seen 4ot natural waves on Lake
 
06:54:22.670 --> 06:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
spford for the last in the Summers seven
 
06:54:26.030 --> 06:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
74 years well let's just say 60 years
 
06:54:29.590 --> 06:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
starting when I was 14 I have never uh I
 
06:54:32.270 --> 06:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
haven't even seen 3 foot natural waves
 
06:54:35.990 --> 06:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
with huge white caps but never three to
 
06:54:40.030 --> 06:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
four feet We Can't Stop natural erosion
 
06:54:43.030 --> 06:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
from these waves and weather but we can
 
06:54:43.040 --> 06:54:45.070 align:start position:0%
from these waves and weather but we can
minimize

06:54:45.070 --> 06:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
minimize
 
06:54:45.080 --> 06:54:46.868 align:start position:0%
minimize
man-made

06:54:46.868 --> 06:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
man-made
 
06:54:46.878 --> 06:54:49.510 align:start position:0%
man-made

06:54:49.510 --> 06:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
damage
 
06:54:51.750 --> 06:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
questions any questions the members of
 
06:54:53.548 --> 06:54:53.558 align:start position:0%

afterwards so be
 
06:55:20.670 --> 06:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
prepare hi thank you so much for
 
06:55:22.150 --> 06:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
listening and giving us all the
 
06:55:24.868 --> 06:55:24.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak my name is Alexia
 
06:55:27.788 --> 06:55:27.798 align:start position:0%
montoo and I'm up here to oppose this
 
06:55:31.468 --> 06:55:31.478 align:start position:0%
bill um for many years I wasn't
 
06:55:33.750 --> 06:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
particularly interested in water sports
 
06:55:35.948 --> 06:55:35.958 align:start position:0%
I never really enjoyed it I had tried
 
06:55:38.310 --> 06:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
water skiing I tried kneeboarding but
 
06:55:40.110 --> 06:55:40.120 align:start position:0%
none of it I really liked none of it
 
06:55:42.548 --> 06:55:42.558 align:start position:0%
really clicked for me until I did wake
 
06:55:42.558 --> 06:55:44.270 align:start position:0%
really clicked for me until I did wake
surfing

06:55:44.270 --> 06:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
surfing
 
06:55:47.548 --> 06:55:47.558 align:start position:0%
um uh I always felt like it's easier to
 
06:55:50.030 --> 06:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
communicate with the driver um since
 
06:55:52.270 --> 06:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
you're not as far away from the boat
 
06:55:55.548 --> 06:55:55.558 align:start position:0%
like that makes it easier um there's
 
06:55:59.468 --> 06:55:59.478 align:start position:0%
like a way uh lower risk of in of injury
 
06:56:01.830 --> 06:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
because when you fall it's very tame and
 
06:56:03.910 --> 06:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
I also feel like it's just a very tame
 
06:56:07.150 --> 06:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
sport overall for any age and anybody
 
06:56:10.990 --> 06:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
coming from any athletic background um
 
06:56:13.910 --> 06:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
so I feel like I've also never heard
 
06:56:18.150 --> 06:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
anyone complain about um our behavior on
 
06:56:19.910 --> 06:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
our River we're from Bellamy River in
 
06:56:23.510 --> 06:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
Dober New Hampshire um about my mom or
 
06:56:26.270 --> 06:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
my stepdad um and how they drive we
 
06:56:29.430 --> 06:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
always stay away from the shore so my
 
06:56:31.230 --> 06:56:31.240 align:start position:0%
family my friends and myself will be
 
06:56:34.350 --> 06:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
deeply disappointed if this passes so
 
06:56:34.360 --> 06:56:35.190 align:start position:0%
deeply disappointed if this passes so
thank

06:56:35.190 --> 06:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:56:38.110 --> 06:56:38.120 align:start position:0%
you we also wanted to talk about the
 
06:56:40.030 --> 06:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
fact that we really care about the
 
06:56:42.350 --> 06:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
environment the past two years we have
 
06:56:44.110 --> 06:56:44.120 align:start position:0%
been working with the living Shor line
 
06:56:47.230 --> 06:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
on Great Bay we actually applied for the
 
06:56:49.990 --> 06:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
grant to help with the shoreline erosion
 
06:56:53.310 --> 06:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
on our property we have spent thousands
 
06:56:57.310 --> 06:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
of dollars on Plants um to prevent the
 
06:57:03.030 --> 06:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
erosion and as a boat owner um we
 
06:57:06.070 --> 06:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
realize it's not from the boat and would
 
06:57:07.708 --> 06:57:07.718 align:start position:0%
not have the boat and be spending the
 
06:57:11.388 --> 06:57:11.398 align:start position:0%
money in our yard if it was caused by
 
06:57:12.990 --> 06:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
the boat that would be
 
06:57:14.710 --> 06:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
counterproductive so
 
06:57:14.720 --> 06:57:16.430 align:start position:0%
counterproductive so

[Music]
 
06:57:20.430 --> 06:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
we after applying for the um Grant we've
 
06:57:22.990 --> 06:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
been working with Dees and
 
06:57:27.990 --> 06:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:31.310 --> 06:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
was I'm going to read this so this was
 
06:57:33.430 --> 06:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
from the Great Bay living Shoreline
 
06:57:35.230 --> 06:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
project site
 
06:57:38.030 --> 06:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
profile erosion at the site is likely
 
06:57:39.388 --> 06:57:39.398 align:start position:0%
driven by
 
06:57:42.788 --> 06:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
inundation and Ice scoring boat wake
 
06:57:45.190 --> 06:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
pressure is unlikely to be causing the
 
06:57:48.708 --> 06:57:48.718 align:start position:0%
erosion and the bank is not shaded an
 
06:57:52.388 --> 06:57:52.398 align:start position:0%
existing seaw wall is damaged mod lawn
 
06:57:54.750 --> 06:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
spots the salt marsh on the landward
 
06:57:58.590 --> 06:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
edge abundant native micro algae on the
 
06:58:01.150 --> 06:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
seaward Edge contributes to suitable
 
06:58:03.788 --> 06:58:03.798 align:start position:0%
conditions for a living Shoreline but
 
06:58:05.868 --> 06:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because of the cost of
 
06:58:08.670 --> 06:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
fixing the shoreline we are just going
 
06:58:12.110 --> 06:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
to continue planting different plants
 
06:58:14.548 --> 06:58:14.558 align:start position:0%
but as boers
 
06:58:17.830 --> 06:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
were very cautious and we care about
 
06:58:20.548 --> 06:58:20.558 align:start position:0%
other people's properties and this bill
 
06:58:23.708 --> 06:58:23.718 align:start position:0%
will really affect us and nobody today
 
06:58:29.070 --> 06:58:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:31.548 --> 06:58:31.558 align:start position:0%
well are there any questions by members
 
06:58:33.628 --> 06:58:33.638 align:start position:0%
of the
 
06:58:36.110 --> 06:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing or seeing none thank
 
06:58:38.230 --> 06:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
you very much thank
 
06:58:42.670 --> 06:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:49.388 --> 06:58:49.398 align:start position:0%
jenus and you'll be followed by Dylan
 
06:58:54.830 --> 06:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:56.750 --> 06:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh my name is Mike
 
06:58:59.990 --> 06:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
Janis from sunap and I I will try to be
 
06:59:02.388 --> 06:59:02.398 align:start position:0%
very brief and given the amount of of
 
06:59:04.230 --> 06:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
time you've been here but also the fact
 
06:59:06.190 --> 06:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
that many of the issues that I was
 
06:59:08.708 --> 06:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak to have been spoken to
 
06:59:11.190 --> 06:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
by others but I do want to to raise a
 
06:59:15.030 --> 06:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
few issues so so first I I am a kayaker
 
06:59:17.788 --> 06:59:17.798 align:start position:0%
who believe it's increasingly unsafe the
 
06:59:20.468 --> 06:59:20.478 align:start position:0%
kayak on Lake sopy during the middle of
 
06:59:23.070 --> 06:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
most days it's not even weekend days
 
06:59:24.868 --> 06:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
it's weekday and this has been an
 
06:59:28.388 --> 06:59:28.398 align:start position:0%
increase over the last uh several years
 
06:59:31.190 --> 06:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh I understand the passion uh with
 
06:59:33.510 --> 06:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
which wake Sports enthusiasts come to I
 
06:59:35.750 --> 06:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
was particularly uh moved by the
 
06:59:38.230 --> 06:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
discussion earlier about how we help our
 
06:59:40.270 --> 06:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
veterans and other people through wake
 
06:59:42.150 --> 06:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
Sports I think it's I think wake
 
06:59:44.708 --> 06:59:44.718 align:start position:0%
sporting undoubtedly is a great activity
 
06:59:47.350 --> 06:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
I don't do it but I have witnessed the
 
06:59:49.388 --> 06:59:49.398 align:start position:0%
the safety issues I've experienced the
 
06:59:51.070 --> 06:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
safety issues I've witnessed the
 
06:59:53.628 --> 06:59:53.638 align:start position:0%
shorland erosion issues and with the
 
06:59:55.548 --> 06:59:55.558 align:start position:0%
rights that we all have to use the lake
 
06:59:55.558 --> 06:59:56.628 align:start position:0%
rights that we all have to use the lake
come

06:59:56.628 --> 06:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
come
 
06:59:58.590 --> 06:59:58.600 align:start position:0%
responsibilities the the
 
07:00:01.430 --> 07:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
industries um suggested guidelines come
 
07:00:03.510 --> 07:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
nowhere close to meeting the
 
07:00:06.388 --> 07:00:06.398 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to Public Safety and to
 
07:00:08.788 --> 07:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
the natural environment but you've heard
 
07:00:10.910 --> 07:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
a lot about that I want to touch on a
 
07:00:13.628 --> 07:00:13.638 align:start position:0%
couple things that uh were were briefly
 
07:00:16.150 --> 07:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
touched on by by the speaker from Lake
 
07:00:18.030 --> 07:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
spford uh but they actually have a
 
07:00:19.910 --> 07:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
couple of other elements so first of all
 
07:00:21.750 --> 07:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
she brought up the Shoreland protection
 
07:00:21.760 --> 07:00:22.670 align:start position:0%
she brought up the Shoreland protection
act

07:00:22.670 --> 07:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
act
 
07:00:26.070 --> 07:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh which was passed 15 17 years ago
 
07:00:28.350 --> 07:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
something in that time frame I don't
 
07:00:30.310 --> 07:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
know how many of you would have been uh
 
07:00:32.628 --> 07:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
in the legislature at the time I'm sure
 
07:00:35.190 --> 07:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
you heard from a lot of passionate land
 
07:00:38.230 --> 07:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
owners how dare you tell me what I can
 
07:00:41.510 --> 07:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
do to develop my property and yet the
 
07:00:43.708 --> 07:00:43.718 align:start position:0%
legislature recognized the balance
 
07:00:46.110 --> 07:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
between private rights and public
 
07:00:48.468 --> 07:00:48.478 align:start position:0%
obligations and impose what I believe
 
07:00:50.788 --> 07:00:50.798 align:start position:0%
living on a lake and having experienced
 
07:00:53.708 --> 07:00:53.718 align:start position:0%
the shorel protection Act is a very
 
07:00:56.788 --> 07:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
reasonable set of conditions to put on
 
07:01:00.070 --> 07:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
the the owners of property restricting
 
07:01:02.788 --> 07:01:02.798 align:start position:0%
their rights for the common good and I
 
07:01:04.510 --> 07:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
think that's been a good act we could do
 
07:01:06.868 --> 07:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
more with it the second point I would
 
07:01:09.628 --> 07:01:09.638 align:start position:0%
make though and and this is not covered
 
07:01:11.628 --> 07:01:11.638 align:start position:0%
um directly in the well it is covered in
 
07:01:14.350 --> 07:01:14.360 align:start position:0%
the testimon I'm sorry is the other
 
07:01:16.350 --> 07:01:16.360 align:start position:0%
aspect of the Shoreland protection act
 
07:01:19.788 --> 07:01:19.798 align:start position:0%
is that unfortunately Dees doesn't have
 
07:01:23.190 --> 07:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of resource to to uh enforce it
 
07:01:25.270 --> 07:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
they enforce it by issuing permits and
 
07:01:28.150 --> 07:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
they do lots of research about granting
 
07:01:30.830 --> 07:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
you a permit but they don't do much
 
07:01:34.270 --> 07:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up work afterward enforcement is
 
07:01:36.990 --> 07:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
self enforcement much as it is on our
 
07:01:39.190 --> 07:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
Lakes when we don't have Marine Patrol
 
07:01:41.270 --> 07:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
and yet enforcement takes place because
 
07:01:44.628 --> 07:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
people do obey the laws and obey the
 
07:01:46.910 --> 07:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
permits they're given and if you change
 
07:01:50.070 --> 07:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
this law as as we're recommending it
 
07:01:54.310 --> 07:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
will be uh um uh followed by most wakes
 
07:01:57.310 --> 07:01:57.320 align:start position:0%
sport uh enthusiasts who want to follow
 
07:01:59.788 --> 07:01:59.798 align:start position:0%
the law this is not going to be a burden
 
07:02:01.548 --> 07:02:01.558 align:start position:0%
on Marine Patrol they don't have the
 
07:02:05.910 --> 07:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
resources to to um um uh follow up
 
07:02:09.468 --> 07:02:09.478 align:start position:0%
anyway I'll make one last point and then
 
07:02:11.430 --> 07:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
the question that representative Darby
 
07:02:14.350 --> 07:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
has asked on a number of people about
 
07:02:17.150 --> 07:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
four foot waves I'm sure we've had some
 
07:02:19.628 --> 07:02:19.638 align:start position:0%
waves like that during very big storms
 
07:02:21.510 --> 07:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know I don't want to say we haven't
 
07:02:24.190 --> 07:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
when I first moved to to Lake sunap 15
 
07:02:25.948 --> 07:02:25.958 align:start position:0%
years ago though we wanted to build a
 
07:02:28.708 --> 07:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
permanent dock at our property but
 
07:02:30.270 --> 07:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to build a permanent
 
07:02:32.150 --> 07:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
dock anymore on the Lakes unless you're
 
07:02:35.868 --> 07:02:35.878 align:start position:0%
able to show um wave evidence through an
 
07:02:38.628 --> 07:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
EST installation of a wave pole with
 
07:02:40.830 --> 07:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
cameras that show you have sustained
 
07:02:44.150 --> 07:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
high wave activity over 4H hour periods
 
07:02:46.750 --> 07:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
multiple times a year we put in the wave
 
07:02:49.628 --> 07:02:49.638 align:start position:0%
pole we put in the camera we could not
 
07:02:52.910 --> 07:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
prove the wave activity at my location
 
07:02:55.310 --> 07:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
if I put a wave pole out there today it
 
07:02:57.430 --> 07:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
would easily match the stand meet the
 
07:02:59.948 --> 07:02:59.958 align:start position:0%
standard of Dees the wave activity is
 
07:03:02.670 --> 07:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
that high and that constant thank you
 
07:03:04.670 --> 07:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
very much for for your work on this very
 
07:03:06.350 --> 07:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
important effort I'd be happy to take
 
07:03:06.360 --> 07:03:07.310 align:start position:0%
important effort I'd be happy to take
any

07:03:07.310 --> 07:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
any
 
07:03:09.708 --> 07:03:09.718 align:start position:0%
questions any questions by members of
 
07:03:13.190 --> 07:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
the committee yes Mr
 
07:03:16.270 --> 07:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
chair more question thank you Mr chair
 
07:03:18.110 --> 07:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you
 
07:03:20.590 --> 07:03:20.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think briefly that you felt
 
07:03:22.830 --> 07:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
unsafe kayaking on on Lake santap which
 
07:03:25.468 --> 07:03:25.478 align:start position:0%
is a pretty large lake with lots of Coes
 
07:03:28.150 --> 07:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
can you um give me add some color
 
07:03:30.388 --> 07:03:30.398 align:start position:0%
provide an example of how you felt
 
07:03:33.430 --> 07:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
unsafe well it you I stay relatively
 
07:03:35.670 --> 07:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
close to shore I don't get out into the
 
07:03:37.590 --> 07:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
middle of the lake because that that
 
07:03:40.910 --> 07:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
would be crazy even you know before the
 
07:03:43.990 --> 07:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
the the increase in Wake booat activity
 
07:03:46.070 --> 07:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh but but you don't see these waves
 
07:03:48.388 --> 07:03:48.398 align:start position:0%
coming and they are powerful and they
 
07:03:51.468 --> 07:03:51.478 align:start position:0%
are high and they knock me for a loop
 
07:03:54.270 --> 07:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
you know and it's it's unlike I I I
 
07:03:56.430 --> 07:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
agree with the comment made by Tu about
 
07:03:59.628 --> 07:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
tubers I hate tubers I'm not a problem I
 
07:04:01.150 --> 07:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with jet skiers out
 
07:04:03.030 --> 07:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
there while I'm kayaking tubers cause
 
07:04:05.590 --> 07:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
lots of of problems too but most other
 
07:04:08.750 --> 07:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
boating activity does not cause the the
 
07:04:11.070 --> 07:04:11.080 align:start position:0%
problems that that you know when it's
 
07:04:12.948 --> 07:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
coming from a wake boat you look then up
 
07:04:14.990 --> 07:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
and you see the boat at a distance it's
 
07:04:18.388 --> 07:04:18.398 align:start position:0%
long path the wave knocks you and and I
 
07:04:20.150 --> 07:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
have been almost knocked in the lake on
 
07:04:23.070 --> 07:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
multiple occasions
 
07:04:24.948 --> 07:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
any other
 
07:04:27.830 --> 07:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you Mr chairman
 
07:04:29.868 --> 07:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
07:04:33.510 --> 07:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
much Dylan Carr followed by Steve
 
07:04:37.628 --> 07:04:37.638 align:start position:0%
Windgate so Mr Windgate be PR
 
07:04:39.990 --> 07:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
prepared how's it going my name is Dylan
 
07:04:42.788 --> 07:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
Carr I live in Alton Bay New Hampshire
 
07:04:45.510 --> 07:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
and uh I own a
 
07:04:48.990 --> 07:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
surfboat um I bought a Surf Boat about a
 
07:04:51.788 --> 07:04:51.798 align:start position:0%
year ago I'm 27 years old I'm I'm a very
 
07:04:53.910 --> 07:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
responsible Surfer and I think that a
 
07:04:56.750 --> 07:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
lot of the issues um spur from lack of
 
07:04:59.190 --> 07:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
Education um I work in the Marine
 
07:05:00.990 --> 07:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
industry and we see many different
 
07:05:03.590 --> 07:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
things with surfboats uh really a lot of
 
07:05:06.868 --> 07:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
negligence but uh education is key in
 
07:05:09.150 --> 07:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
this case but there's two points that I
 
07:05:11.548 --> 07:05:11.558 align:start position:0%
really wanted to bring up um the first
 
07:05:14.468 --> 07:05:14.478 align:start position:0%
being CYO bacteria
 
07:05:17.548 --> 07:05:17.558 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the cdc's website it
 
07:05:19.548 --> 07:05:19.558 align:start position:0%
says that the number two leading causes
 
07:05:23.150 --> 07:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
are fertilizer and in septic
 
07:05:25.708 --> 07:05:25.718 align:start position:0%
systems I don't understand how surfboats
 
07:05:25.718 --> 07:05:26.628 align:start position:0%
systems I don't understand how surfboats
can

07:05:26.628 --> 07:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
can
 
07:05:29.830 --> 07:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
be you know I just don't understand how
 
07:05:32.350 --> 07:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
surf boats are even associated with that
 
07:05:35.548 --> 07:05:35.558 align:start position:0%
and sorry I'm a little nervous
 
07:05:37.670 --> 07:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
here uh the second one is shoreline
 
07:05:40.270 --> 07:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
erosion so I have a side business where
 
07:05:42.548 --> 07:05:42.558 align:start position:0%
I fly drones and one of the very first
 
07:05:45.510 --> 07:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
properties that I surveyed back in 2019
 
07:05:47.910 --> 07:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
is on Lake wiip pasak um more
 
07:05:50.310 --> 07:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
specifically in Tuftonboro it's a high
 
07:05:52.990 --> 07:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
traffic area um and I've monitored this
 
07:05:55.830 --> 07:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
home for the last five years over the
 
07:05:57.548 --> 07:05:57.558 align:start position:0%
last five years there have been no
 
07:06:00.948 --> 07:06:00.958 align:start position:0%
notice noticeable signs of erosion and I
 
07:06:03.750 --> 07:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
know this because I create what we call
 
07:06:06.350 --> 07:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
a Ortho which is a 2d map and we're able
 
07:06:08.350 --> 07:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
to reference the height of the lake and
 
07:06:11.310 --> 07:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
landmarks to determine exactly where the
 
07:06:13.270 --> 07:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
shoreline is and in this specific
 
07:06:15.350 --> 07:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
scenario which is a hot spot for travel
 
07:06:17.350 --> 07:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
and wake surfing there have been no
 
07:06:18.590 --> 07:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
signs of
 
07:06:27.310 --> 07:06:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:30.510 --> 07:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
is there any questions by members of the
 
07:06:30.520 --> 07:06:33.350 align:start position:0%
is there any questions by members of the
uh

07:06:33.350 --> 07:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:37.350 --> 07:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
07:06:37.360 --> 07:06:39.430 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
much

07:06:39.430 --> 07:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
much
 
07:06:39.440 --> 07:06:41.430 align:start position:0%
much
uh

07:06:41.430 --> 07:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:06:49.110 --> 07:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:52.110 --> 07:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
y okay they're up good
 
07:06:53.788 --> 07:06:53.798 align:start position:0%
wow it's been a long
 
07:06:57.110 --> 07:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
day telling me thank you very much for
 
07:07:00.110 --> 07:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:02.910 --> 07:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
testimony um I'm from uh
 
07:07:05.788 --> 07:07:05.798 align:start position:0%
Tuftonboro Winter Harbor Lake
 
07:07:11.430 --> 07:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
winaki I go back to uh 1948
 
07:07:15.468 --> 07:07:15.478 align:start position:0%
y my grandfather originally purchased
 
07:07:19.750 --> 07:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
900 Acres uh sorry 9900 ft of shorefront
 
07:07:23.230 --> 07:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
and our uh family has developed maybe
 
07:07:26.590 --> 07:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
200 feet so we have 700 feet
 
07:07:29.708 --> 07:07:29.718 align:start position:0%
of what should be natural Shoreline but
 
07:07:33.310 --> 07:07:33.320 align:start position:0%
it's uh suffers from erosion uh
 
07:07:36.070 --> 07:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
shoreline erosion and I I think uh the
 
07:07:38.788 --> 07:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
variable has been ever
 
07:07:42.510 --> 07:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
increasing uh W boat wakes and ever
 
07:07:47.030 --> 07:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
increasing boat size and boat
 
07:07:51.190 --> 07:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
power in those early days uh my brothers
 
07:07:53.230 --> 07:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
and sisters and I would be out playing
 
07:07:55.670 --> 07:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
and if we'd hear a boat we'd run out to
 
07:07:58.948 --> 07:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
the shore to see who it was and we
 
07:08:01.468 --> 07:08:01.478 align:start position:0%
usually know because it there weren't
 
07:08:03.350 --> 07:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
there many boats power boats at that
 
07:08:06.270 --> 07:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
time and so things have changed a lot
 
07:08:09.830 --> 07:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:14.190 --> 07:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
time in 2021 a period of a group of uh
 
07:08:16.670 --> 07:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
volunteers under the supervision of uh
 
07:08:18.750 --> 07:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes uh monitoring
 
07:08:21.510 --> 07:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
program conducted a study of effects of
 
07:08:24.830 --> 07:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
boat wakes on water quality samples were
 
07:08:27.388 --> 07:08:27.398 align:start position:0%
taken when boat activity was both low
 
07:08:31.350 --> 07:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
and high the study concluded that 43%
 
07:08:35.468 --> 07:08:35.478 align:start position:0%
increase in turbidity that's cloudiness
 
07:08:38.830 --> 07:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
that you see in the water uh increased
 
07:08:42.830 --> 07:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
on days of uh heavy boat activity and uh
 
07:08:45.388 --> 07:08:45.398 align:start position:0%
30% increase of phosphorus on high
 
07:08:48.150 --> 07:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
boating activity days and when we looked
 
07:08:50.548 --> 07:08:50.558 align:start position:0%
at the information in detail we actually
 
07:08:51.868 --> 07:08:51.878 align:start position:0%
saw a lot of
 
07:08:56.510 --> 07:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
resilience in turbidity and phosphorus
 
07:09:01.190 --> 07:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
on moderate boat days Boat Boat use days
 
07:09:03.788 --> 07:09:03.798 align:start position:0%
it seemed to be on heavy days with a lot
 
07:09:09.350 --> 07:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:12.510 --> 07:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
increases wake boarding closer to shore
 
07:09:16.708 --> 07:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
like 2 250 ft and on my proerty property
 
07:09:16.718 --> 07:09:17.628 align:start position:0%
like 2 250 ft and on my proerty property
is

07:09:17.628 --> 07:09:17.638 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:09:19.670 --> 07:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
dramatic uh waves break over the
 
07:09:22.750 --> 07:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
shoreline violently wash organic matter
 
07:09:24.990 --> 07:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
and mineral soil into this
 
07:09:29.670 --> 07:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
Lake um my dock is flooded and my boat
 
07:09:32.788 --> 07:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
crashes against it my sailboat on a
 
07:09:35.510 --> 07:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
mooring rocks violently and I've had to
 
07:09:38.868 --> 07:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
repair the rigging several
 
07:09:41.430 --> 07:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
times we can't go back in time but we
 
07:09:44.310 --> 07:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
can find solutions for the future with
 
07:09:46.868 --> 07:09:46.878 align:start position:0%
different Lake interests are in Conflict
 
07:09:49.070 --> 07:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
we should be able to find a way get
 
07:09:51.868 --> 07:09:51.878 align:start position:0%
along we have the responsibility to seek
 
07:09:54.350 --> 07:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
compromise which maximizes the benefits
 
07:09:57.670 --> 07:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
for all in this case 500 ft makes all
 
07:09:57.680 --> 07:09:58.708 align:start position:0%
for all in this case 500 ft makes all
the

07:09:58.708 --> 07:09:58.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:10:00.830 --> 07:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
difference there's an old
 
07:10:03.150 --> 07:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
saying a place for everything and
 
07:10:06.070 --> 07:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
everything in its place it's a place
 
07:10:10.868 --> 07:10:10.878 align:start position:0%
for uh wake Sports is 500 ft
 
07:10:13.270 --> 07:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
out there's still plenty of room out
 
07:10:16.270 --> 07:10:16.280 align:start position:0%
there on the appropriate size lakes and
 
07:10:19.310 --> 07:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
ponds for that activity and it'll
 
07:10:20.230 --> 07:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
protect the
 
07:10:20.240 --> 07:10:22.750 align:start position:0%
protect the
shoreline

07:10:22.750 --> 07:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
shoreline
 
07:10:26.430 --> 07:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to point out that uh my long
 
07:10:29.910 --> 07:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
76 years of experience on Winter
 
07:10:33.708 --> 07:10:33.718 align:start position:0%
Harbor uh I have been through hurricanes
 
07:10:37.350 --> 07:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh and several tropical storms and I
 
07:10:38.590 --> 07:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
watched the
 
07:10:42.468 --> 07:10:42.478 align:start position:0%
waves and on Winter Harbor which is the
 
07:10:45.310 --> 07:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
size of a moderate sized Lake narrow
 
07:10:46.990 --> 07:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
opening out into the greater part of
 
07:10:51.230 --> 07:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
winaki the waves are maybe 6 Ines to a
 
07:10:54.590 --> 07:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
foot high doesn't compare with big Boke
 
07:10:57.910 --> 07:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
wakes and it doesn't even come close to
 
07:11:01.708 --> 07:11:01.718 align:start position:0%
uh wakeboard L wakes I've also seen a
 
07:11:03.868 --> 07:11:03.878 align:start position:0%
lot of responsible wake boarders out
 
07:11:05.830 --> 07:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
there they tend to stay out in the
 
07:11:08.230 --> 07:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
middle of the area they also pay
 
07:11:09.628 --> 07:11:09.638 align:start position:0%
attention the ones that have the
 
07:11:11.310 --> 07:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
diverters on their boats they pay
 
07:11:13.388 --> 07:11:13.398 align:start position:0%
attention to which way they're going and
 
07:11:15.350 --> 07:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
then there's a lot that don't thank you
 
07:11:16.510 --> 07:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
for your
 
07:11:18.910 --> 07:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much is there any
 
07:11:22.310 --> 07:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
questions by members of the committee
 
07:11:25.670 --> 07:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
hearing none thank you very
 
07:11:29.670 --> 07:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:33.670 --> 07:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
F I think it's I think it's f e r
 
07:11:39.230 --> 07:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:39.240 --> 07:11:42.388 align:start position:0%
 
y

07:11:42.388 --> 07:11:42.398 align:start position:0%

07:11:49.670 --> 07:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
conquered okay he would have been
 
07:11:52.110 --> 07:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill all right
 
07:11:56.310 --> 07:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh Mark Murphy this is in support of the
 
07:11:56.320 --> 07:11:59.628 align:start position:0%
uh Mark Murphy this is in support of the
bill

07:11:59.628 --> 07:11:59.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:04.628 --> 07:12:04.638 align:start position:0%
uh Mark Murphy in supported okay and
 
07:12:07.510 --> 07:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
also Bill Bartley be you're on you're on
 
07:12:09.868 --> 07:12:09.878 align:start position:0%
after M Mr
 
07:12:12.430 --> 07:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
Murphy hi uh my name is Mark Murphy I'm
 
07:12:15.190 --> 07:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
a Plymouth New Hampshire resident um I
 
07:12:17.910 --> 07:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
also own Waterfront I'm Lake wiip
 
07:12:19.670 --> 07:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
um little history on me I learned to
 
07:12:21.990 --> 07:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
wakeboard over 30 years ago
 
07:12:23.430 --> 07:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh so far back in fact that it was
 
07:12:25.990 --> 07:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
referred to as scarfing a name that's
 
07:12:28.150 --> 07:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
disappeared into history I have no
 
07:12:30.310 --> 07:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
opposition to the sport itself um I was
 
07:12:31.750 --> 07:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
in the chamber earlier this morning to
 
07:12:33.788 --> 07:12:33.798 align:start position:0%
oppose the restrictions on personal
 
07:12:36.110 --> 07:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
watercraft uh I lean towards the
 
07:12:38.270 --> 07:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
libertarian to be honest with you right
 
07:12:40.350 --> 07:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
now I'm here to support this bill the
 
07:12:42.868 --> 07:12:42.878 align:start position:0%
difference between the PWC Bill and this
 
07:12:46.190 --> 07:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
one to me is simply put one person's
 
07:12:48.510 --> 07:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
freedom to recreate in the way they wish
 
07:12:50.628 --> 07:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
should only be limited when it infringes
 
07:12:54.030 --> 07:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
on another person's rights in this case
 
07:12:56.150 --> 07:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
these boats specifically designed to
 
07:12:59.070 --> 07:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
throw large wakes do in fact or can at
 
07:13:01.350 --> 07:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
least infringe on Waterfront owners
 
07:13:03.708 --> 07:13:03.718 align:start position:0%
rights to protect their property
 
07:13:06.070 --> 07:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
especially if you're in a Leeward area
 
07:13:08.388 --> 07:13:08.398 align:start position:0%
where wind driven W uh waves may not be
 
07:13:11.310 --> 07:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
so much of a problem these boats can
 
07:13:13.510 --> 07:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
create that problem those shorelines are
 
07:13:17.350 --> 07:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
less Rocky more soil and have the
 
07:13:19.948 --> 07:13:19.958 align:start position:0%
ability to be eroded easier these boats
 
07:13:21.910 --> 07:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
if they oper operate in those areas can
 
07:13:24.430 --> 07:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
cause damage there no other type of boat
 
07:13:26.190 --> 07:13:26.200 align:start position:0%
is designed in such a way to maximize
 
07:13:28.468 --> 07:13:28.478 align:start position:0%
its wake and thereby maximize its damage
 
07:13:30.868 --> 07:13:30.878 align:start position:0%
to the Shor line and that's what makes a
 
07:13:33.510 --> 07:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
wake boat different than other boats so
 
07:13:35.868 --> 07:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
if we talk about why we should look at
 
07:13:38.150 --> 07:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
one segment of the Boating population
 
07:13:39.750 --> 07:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
these are boats literally designed to
 
07:13:42.070 --> 07:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
maximize their wake and the resulting
 
07:13:44.270 --> 07:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
damage to the Shoreline I believe is
 
07:13:47.388 --> 07:13:47.398 align:start position:0%
real so much of my Shoreline is Leeward
 
07:13:49.708 --> 07:13:49.718 align:start position:0%
not affected by Major winds the
 
07:13:51.868 --> 07:13:51.878 align:start position:0%
prevailing Northwest winds
 
07:13:54.350 --> 07:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
so I don't see as much damage from wind
 
07:13:56.510 --> 07:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
on those parts of the shoreline I can
 
07:13:58.750 --> 07:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
see that damage from these boats and I
 
07:14:00.830 --> 07:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
don't feel that my rights as a property
 
07:14:03.788 --> 07:14:03.798 align:start position:0%
owner should be put in Jeopardy because
 
07:14:06.150 --> 07:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
other people wish to recreate close to
 
07:14:08.190 --> 07:14:08.200 align:start position:0%
my Shoreline with a boat designed to
 
07:14:10.430 --> 07:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
maximize their wake I would also note
 
07:14:11.948 --> 07:14:11.958 align:start position:0%
that I don't have another remedy at law
 
07:14:14.510 --> 07:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
to prevent this tor of damage I can't
 
07:14:16.628 --> 07:14:16.638 align:start position:0%
sue the individual Boat Owners or
 
07:14:18.230 --> 07:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
anything not that I would but the point
 
07:14:21.190 --> 07:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
is there's no other way for me to to
 
07:14:23.230 --> 07:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
prevent this sort of damage to my
 
07:14:25.868 --> 07:14:25.878 align:start position:0%
property this erosion uh historically
 
07:14:27.230 --> 07:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
this chamber's job has always been to
 
07:14:29.788 --> 07:14:29.798 align:start position:0%
protect the rights and freedoms of the
 
07:14:31.948 --> 07:14:31.958 align:start position:0%
residents of the state I would ask the
 
07:14:33.270 --> 07:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
committee in this case to consider the
 
07:14:35.430 --> 07:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
landowner rights and thus support the
 
07:14:38.070 --> 07:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
bill that restricts but does not ban the
 
07:14:41.270 --> 07:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
use of wake Boats open it to
 
07:14:43.510 --> 07:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
questions any questions by members of
 
07:14:43.520 --> 07:14:45.190 align:start position:0%
questions any questions by members of
the

07:14:45.190 --> 07:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:14:47.468 --> 07:14:47.478 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing and seeing none thank
 
07:14:48.708 --> 07:14:48.718 align:start position:0%
you very
 
07:14:53.510 --> 07:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:56.230 --> 07:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
and followed
 
07:14:58.990 --> 07:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
by oh man
 
07:15:03.910 --> 07:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:08.670 --> 07:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
near anyway okay you're up after after
 
07:15:12.190 --> 07:15:12.200 align:start position:0%
him Mr Speaker members thank you not I
 
07:15:13.548 --> 07:15:13.558 align:start position:0%
will be brief
 
07:15:16.788 --> 07:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
sorry I will be brief 2 minutes 4
 
07:15:18.830 --> 07:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
seconds go hope you get brownie points
 
07:15:21.270 --> 07:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
for the opposition for that your time is
 
07:15:23.230 --> 07:15:23.240 align:start position:0%
running I'm lucky enough to own
 
07:15:25.350 --> 07:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
waterfront property on Barn in uh on
 
07:15:26.670 --> 07:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
Half Moon Lake in
 
07:15:29.110 --> 07:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
Barnstead wake surf boats do not
 
07:15:31.548 --> 07:15:31.558 align:start position:0%
directly cause erosion any
 
07:15:34.910 --> 07:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
evidence is anecdotal all boats and Jet
 
07:15:37.270 --> 07:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
Skis can cause wave
 
07:15:39.468 --> 07:15:39.478 align:start position:0%
generation there are no scientific
 
07:15:41.948 --> 07:15:41.958 align:start position:0%
studies specifically focused on wake
 
07:15:43.910 --> 07:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
surf boats causing
 
07:15:46.990 --> 07:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
erosion most of the waves or wakes on
 
07:15:49.948 --> 07:15:49.958 align:start position:0%
these Lakes is caused by wind typically
 
07:15:52.468 --> 07:15:52.478 align:start position:0%
late morning to midday the wind is
 
07:15:54.548 --> 07:15:54.558 align:start position:0%
generated by the different temperatures
 
07:15:57.430 --> 07:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
of air in land the larger Lakes will
 
07:15:59.510 --> 07:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
have bigger waves because more energy is
 
07:16:01.628 --> 07:16:01.638 align:start position:0%
generated over the larger
 
07:16:04.750 --> 07:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
surface boating will increase the waves
 
07:16:06.910 --> 07:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
and wake typically the tubers and jet
 
07:16:10.270 --> 07:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
skis enjoy this surfing and skiing does
 
07:16:13.310 --> 07:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
not like wake it's no fun being out
 
07:16:16.150 --> 07:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
there in a wake surf boat or a ski booat
 
07:16:18.910 --> 07:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the day nobody is those
 
07:16:21.230 --> 07:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
boats are all on the docks
 
07:16:23.830 --> 07:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
waiting it out because in the middle of
 
07:16:25.468 --> 07:16:25.478 align:start position:0%
the day between the wind and the boat
 
07:16:27.830 --> 07:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
activity there's just way too much wake
 
07:16:29.628 --> 07:16:29.638 align:start position:0%
we're not out
 
07:16:32.910 --> 07:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
there ice wind and fluctuating water
 
07:16:35.110 --> 07:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
water levels cause the most erosion on
 
07:16:38.190 --> 07:16:38.200 align:start position:0%
these Lakes you have natural Shor lines
 
07:16:40.030 --> 07:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
and you have engineered Shor lines
 
07:16:41.910 --> 07:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
engineered Shor lines will see the most
 
07:16:45.708 --> 07:16:45.718 align:start position:0%
damage for obvious reasons I have 75 ft
 
07:16:48.750 --> 07:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
of natural Shoreline a Sandy Beach the
 
07:16:50.990 --> 07:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
ice in the winter does the most damage
 
07:16:54.110 --> 07:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
some some years our beach is small some
 
07:16:57.788 --> 07:16:57.798 align:start position:0%
years it's big it changes we love our
 
07:17:01.468 --> 07:17:01.478 align:start position:0%
beach as a waterfront property owner I
 
07:17:03.110 --> 07:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
have a huge investment in the health of
 
07:17:06.350 --> 07:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
our Lake as a family we enjoy fishing
 
07:17:09.070 --> 07:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
tubing skiing surfing sailing and
 
07:17:11.910 --> 07:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
swimming on our Lake we have over 20
 
07:17:15.190 --> 07:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
years and into our second generation we
 
07:17:18.388 --> 07:17:18.398 align:start position:0%
cherish our time together on this Lake
 
07:17:20.270 --> 07:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
picking on one group of people who are
 
07:17:22.788 --> 07:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
using using our Lakes for recreation
 
07:17:24.670 --> 07:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like the New Hampshire
 
07:17:27.030 --> 07:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
that I know and love to the people who
 
07:17:28.548 --> 07:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
want to regulate wake
 
07:17:31.670 --> 07:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
surfing the Lakes belong to everyone we
 
07:17:34.270 --> 07:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
all need to share it we all need to care
 
07:17:36.788 --> 07:17:36.798 align:start position:0%
for it let's be good neighbors and share
 
07:17:39.788 --> 07:17:39.798 align:start position:0%
these legs thank you very much for your
 
07:17:42.868 --> 07:17:42.878 align:start position:0%
time any questions by members of the
 
07:17:45.788 --> 07:17:45.798 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing and seeing
 
07:17:48.990 --> 07:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
n thank you very much now we're down to
 
07:17:51.670 --> 07:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
the fantastic
 
07:17:54.468 --> 07:17:54.478 align:start position:0%
five Mr Jay
 
07:17:59.750 --> 07:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:03.468 --> 07:18:03.478 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and you'll be followed by
 
07:18:08.190 --> 07:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
Mark Cullen so be prepared thank you
 
07:18:10.110 --> 07:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
very much to one and all for allowing me
 
07:18:12.708 --> 07:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to speak one big
 
07:18:14.310 --> 07:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
difference in my presentation that I've
 
07:18:16.110 --> 07:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
noticed throughout the day listening to
 
07:18:17.830 --> 07:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
everybody closely and watching Everybody
 
07:18:20.708 --> 07:18:20.718 align:start position:0%
closely and that is all the observations
 
07:18:22.070 --> 07:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
up to this point have been from the
 
07:18:25.788 --> 07:18:25.798 align:start position:0%
water surface up all my testimony and uh
 
07:18:27.548 --> 07:18:27.558 align:start position:0%
information that I can share is gathered
 
07:18:29.910 --> 07:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
from my own two eyes from the surface of
 
07:18:33.350 --> 07:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
the water down I'm a commercial diver um
 
07:18:36.150 --> 07:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
and I guess I can just I've cut this
 
07:18:38.350 --> 07:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
down quite a bit for everybody
 
07:18:40.868 --> 07:18:40.878 align:start position:0%
say I'm here to speak about the pristine
 
07:18:42.628 --> 07:18:42.638 align:start position:0%
clear sparkling fresh waters of New
 
07:18:45.190 --> 07:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes but unfortunately I'm
 
07:18:47.788 --> 07:18:47.798 align:start position:0%
not entirely in a position to do that
 
07:18:49.430 --> 07:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
rather I'm here to dispel you of that
 
07:18:51.468 --> 07:18:51.478 align:start position:0%
sparkly myth and to inform you that our
 
07:18:55.270 --> 07:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
Lakes are closer to an emergency 911
 
07:18:57.510 --> 07:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
call I also hold faith that after you
 
07:18:59.150 --> 07:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
hear my observations as to the condition
 
07:19:01.468 --> 07:19:01.478 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Lake qu water quality
 
07:19:02.990 --> 07:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
you'll cast your vote to strengthen our
 
07:19:05.590 --> 07:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
state legislature and help us do our
 
07:19:08.230 --> 07:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
part in preserving Lakes we all love my
 
07:19:10.230 --> 07:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
name is Jay whitehair I live in norwi
 
07:19:13.230 --> 07:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
Vermont I support House Bill
 
07:19:16.150 --> 07:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
1390 and I wakeboarded full confession
 
07:19:18.868 --> 07:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
many times and I very much enjoy it I'm
 
07:19:21.230 --> 07:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
not a scientist however I do have
 
07:19:23.190 --> 07:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
qualified underwater experience that I
 
07:19:25.468 --> 07:19:25.478 align:start position:0%
want to share here and I'm committed to
 
07:19:27.350 --> 07:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
preserving the pristine Waters of New
 
07:19:29.190 --> 07:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I grew up in New Hampshire and
 
07:19:32.270 --> 07:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
spent much of my life exploring enjoying
 
07:19:34.830 --> 07:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
and working on its Waters it's not
 
07:19:36.548 --> 07:19:36.558 align:start position:0%
uncommon for me at this point to spend
 
07:19:39.708 --> 07:19:39.718 align:start position:0%
up to 6 hours a day under the shallow

the water column it's a wellknown fact
 
07:21:11.468 --> 07:21:11.478 align:start position:0%
that these suspended particles gather
 
07:21:13.510 --> 07:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
warmth from the Sun and in turn heat the
 
07:21:15.270 --> 07:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
water itself thereby encouraging more
 
07:21:17.590 --> 07:21:17.600 align:start position:0%

the extent that the sunlight is blocked
 
07:21:29.990 --> 07:21:30.000 align:start position:0%

07:22:09.510 --> 07:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
been through the full gamut of boating
 
07:22:11.310 --> 07:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
and boat building I understand these
 
07:22:13.670 --> 07:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
boats they're causing a lot of damage to
 
07:22:15.830 --> 07:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
our lakes and it's up to the
 
07:22:19.590 --> 07:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility of this group here please
 
07:22:22.670 --> 07:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
to understand understand that and to not
 
07:22:26.990 --> 07:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
so much cater to the financial gains of
 
07:22:28.388 --> 07:22:28.398 align:start position:0%
a lot of these big companies selling
 
07:22:30.628 --> 07:22:30.638 align:start position:0%
very expensive boats thank you very much
 
07:22:32.468 --> 07:22:32.478 align:start position:0%
for your time any questions any
 
07:22:36.030 --> 07:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
questions for by the members of the

you very
 
07:22:44.270 --> 07:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
much Mr Cullen and you'll be followed
 
07:22:48.308 --> 07:22:48.318 align:start position:0%

07:23:02.430 --> 07:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the opportunity to
 
07:23:04.190 --> 07:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
speak today my name is Mark Cullen from

07:23:08.070 --> 07:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm fortunate enough to
 
07:23:09.468 --> 07:23:09.478 align:start position:0%
own lake property on beautiful Lake
 
07:23:11.308 --> 07:23:11.318 align:start position:0%
Massa secum I don't know if any of you
 
07:23:12.830 --> 07:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
guys know it but it's it's a beautiful
 
07:23:15.830 --> 07:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
Lake I've been my family's own property
 
07:23:18.628 --> 07:23:18.638 align:start position:0%
on the lake for more than 40 years okay
 
07:23:20.948 --> 07:23:20.958 align:start position:0%
Lake mum is small
 
07:23:22.708 --> 07:23:22.718 align:start position:0%
right it's got a really shallow end
 
07:23:24.430 --> 07:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
there's two rivers that flow out on this
 
07:23:28.070 --> 07:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
lake so it's really shallow if you could
 
07:23:31.190 --> 07:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
look at picture one you see the red
 
07:23:34.190 --> 07:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
outline of the lake that's the loss of
 
07:23:36.948 --> 07:23:36.958 align:start position:0%
wakes sport real estate that you would
 
07:23:39.948 --> 07:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
lose so that would force boats in a
 
07:23:42.670 --> 07:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
small narrow channel where the Deep part
 
07:23:46.110 --> 07:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:48.990 --> 07:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
is the first concern is with Bo of
 
07:23:51.388 --> 07:23:51.398 align:start position:0%
safety right by compressing the wakes
 
07:23:53.548 --> 07:23:53.558 align:start position:0%
sport area in such a small area creating
 
07:23:53.558 --> 07:23:54.990 align:start position:0%
sport area in such a small area creating
congestive

07:23:54.990 --> 07:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
congestive
 
07:23:58.270 --> 07:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
points for boat kayakers you know
 
07:24:00.750 --> 07:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
swimmers boers will have a narrow area
 
07:24:03.030 --> 07:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
to navigate creating danger to the
 
07:24:05.750 --> 07:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
public now that's a real issue right if
 
07:24:07.230 --> 07:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
you look at that picture you can just
 
07:24:10.430 --> 07:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
see that that is compressed you lose 75%
 
07:24:13.350 --> 07:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
of the lake moved all those wake boats
 
07:24:16.548 --> 07:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
into 25% of the lake right if you look
 
07:24:20.150 --> 07:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
at the next picture you see that a
 
07:24:23.590 --> 07:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
spanned across Lake mum is
 
07:24:27.110 --> 07:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
1,398 feet if you lose 500 feet on both
 
07:24:30.910 --> 07:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
sides of the lake that get you 398 ft
 
07:24:33.388 --> 07:24:33.398 align:start position:0%
now these ski boats right I have a ski
 
07:24:35.548 --> 07:24:35.558 align:start position:0%
boat so I know it's not a wake booat
 
07:24:37.190 --> 07:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's not weighted in the back but it's a
 
07:24:40.670 --> 07:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
ski booat it's a big engine with a shaft
 
07:24:42.308 --> 07:24:42.318 align:start position:0%
that goes right to a brass propeller and
 
07:24:45.190 --> 07:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
a Rudder okay but to to turn that boat
 
07:24:48.430 --> 07:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
in that small area is dangerous you
 
07:24:49.628 --> 07:24:49.638 align:start position:0%
won't be able to do without breaking the
 
07:24:49.638 --> 07:24:50.590 align:start position:0%
won't be able to do without breaking the
law

07:24:50.590 --> 07:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
law
 
07:24:52.110 --> 07:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
you you cannot especially if there's
 
07:24:54.750 --> 07:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
kayaks in there paddle boats in there
 
07:24:56.388 --> 07:24:56.398 align:start position:0%
whatever it's danger it's going to be
 
07:24:58.430 --> 07:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
dangerous to the public on a small Lake
 
07:25:01.230 --> 07:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
like this it is going to be
 
07:25:06.030 --> 07:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:08.948 --> 07:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
is shoreline erosion right that's been a
 
07:25:11.590 --> 07:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
big topic to everybody today right so
 
07:25:13.230 --> 07:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
this will increase the damage in that
 
07:25:15.708 --> 07:25:15.718 align:start position:0%
area right right now I don't see any
 
07:25:17.670 --> 07:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
damage in that area if you look at
 
07:25:20.350 --> 07:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
picture three that little starage where
 
07:25:22.990 --> 07:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
my lake property is right across from
 
07:25:25.548 --> 07:25:25.558 align:start position:0%
where that zone would be right right now
 
07:25:27.910 --> 07:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
I don't see any damage on Shoreline but
 
07:25:31.150 --> 07:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
if this passes I definitely will because
 
07:25:32.868 --> 07:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
all that boat traffic will be right into
 
07:25:35.548 --> 07:25:35.558 align:start position:0%
that narrow channel just moving back and
 
07:25:37.150 --> 07:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
trying to get back into that channel
 
07:25:39.230 --> 07:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
back and forth back and forth into a
 
07:25:39.240 --> 07:25:41.830 align:start position:0%
back and forth back and forth into a
small

07:25:41.830 --> 07:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:43.990 --> 07:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
area concerned about the increased
 
07:25:46.230 --> 07:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
weight splits such that in confined area
 
07:25:48.070 --> 07:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
will affect Wildlife you know I heard a
 
07:25:51.070 --> 07:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
lot of talk about the loons right our
 
07:25:53.030 --> 07:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
Lake uses those signs when the loons are
 
07:25:55.110 --> 07:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
nesting right and everybody is
 
07:25:57.948 --> 07:25:57.958 align:start position:0%
respectful for that right we we slow our
 
07:26:00.628 --> 07:26:00.638 align:start position:0%
boats down we go to no wake in that area
 
07:26:02.350 --> 07:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
just because the loons are nesting and
 
07:26:03.750 --> 07:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
the only reason why I do that it's not a
 
07:26:07.070 --> 07:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
state law it's a sign that says the the
 
07:26:09.270 --> 07:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
loons are nesting so we respect that
 
07:26:11.868 --> 07:26:11.878 align:start position:0%
right we slow down right A lot of people
 
07:26:15.388 --> 07:26:15.398 align:start position:0%
on this Lake small Lake respect the
 
07:26:17.430 --> 07:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
people's property we know what to do we
 
07:26:20.788 --> 07:26:20.798 align:start position:0%
know not to go within 150 ft even 150 ft
 
07:26:22.190 --> 07:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
and just scream up and down the
 
07:26:24.670 --> 07:26:24.680 align:start position:0%
shoreline putting huge wake onto the
 
07:26:27.708 --> 07:26:27.718 align:start position:0%
side of the shore we know not to do that
 
07:26:29.670 --> 07:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
right so a lot of this is just just
 
07:26:33.830 --> 07:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
being good neighbors right
 
07:26:36.708 --> 07:26:36.718 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's uh you know a lot of ice
 
07:26:38.230 --> 07:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
damage a lot of the shore damage I see
 
07:26:40.468 --> 07:26:40.478 align:start position:0%
at the lake being there 40 years is ice
 
07:26:42.510 --> 07:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
ice damage just ripping up the shore
 
07:26:45.350 --> 07:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
when the ice comes in you know like I
 
07:26:47.150 --> 07:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
said I don't see I haven't seen any
 
07:26:48.510 --> 07:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
shore damage
 
07:26:51.030 --> 07:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
from at this point as the law not being
 
07:26:54.350 --> 07:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
changed so within 150 ft off the shore I
 
07:26:56.110 --> 07:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
haven't seen much damage right I'm a
 
07:26:57.548 --> 07:26:57.558 align:start position:0%
little worried about this law if this
 
07:27:02.468 --> 07:27:02.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:05.190 --> 07:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
area so thank you for your
 
07:27:09.388 --> 07:27:09.398 align:start position:0%
time any questions from members of the
 
07:27:11.990 --> 07:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
committee seeing
 
07:27:17.150 --> 07:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:20.150 --> 07:27:20.160 align:start position:0%

Nigro
 
07:27:30.628 --> 07:27:30.638 align:start position:0%
huh he went where oh he says he went on

oh he went already yeah oh
 
07:27:37.350 --> 07:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
okay oh I thought he put in two cards is
 
07:27:40.788 --> 07:27:40.798 align:start position:0%
this good y go right down um my name is
 
07:27:43.948 --> 07:27:43.958 align:start position:0%
Betsy cetron and I'm a resident of New
 
07:27:48.350 --> 07:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
London and I support Bill
 
07:27:51.190 --> 07:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
1390 I
 
07:27:54.510 --> 07:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
segue a little off of this the 4 foot
 
07:27:56.750 --> 07:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
wave I grew up on the ocean I grew up
 
07:28:00.628 --> 07:28:00.638 align:start position:0%
sailing on the ocean I know 4 foot waves
 
07:28:03.868 --> 07:28:03.878 align:start position:0%
I've been at Sunapee for 44 years I love
 
07:28:06.388 --> 07:28:06.398 align:start position:0%
the water I race a sailboat I paddle
 
07:28:09.510 --> 07:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
board kayak I drive a boat for my kids
 
07:28:12.510 --> 07:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
to water ski and Tube the only 4 foot
 
07:28:16.150 --> 07:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
waves on sunap are made by wake boats
 
07:28:20.110 --> 07:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
however with the this legislation
 
07:28:22.350 --> 07:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
the area where the Wake boats are most
 
07:28:26.788 --> 07:28:26.798 align:start position:0%
likely going to be doing their thing is
 
07:28:29.070 --> 07:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
where we want to be out sailing and we
 
07:28:32.030 --> 07:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
are certainly willing to share our
 
07:28:34.150 --> 07:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
recreational area with the wake booat
 
07:28:35.948 --> 07:28:35.958 align:start position:0%
people doing it
 
07:28:39.308 --> 07:28:39.318 align:start position:0%
responsibly I was sitting on the shore
 
07:28:41.750 --> 07:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
on a very calm day
 
07:28:45.948 --> 07:28:45.958 align:start position:0%
5:00 sun was kind of sinking Sandy Beach
 
07:28:47.788 --> 07:28:47.798 align:start position:0%
nothing going on I'm reading a book my
 
07:28:50.350 --> 07:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
feet are in the water all of a sudden my
 
07:28:51.830 --> 07:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
butt gets
 
07:28:55.788 --> 07:28:55.798 align:start position:0%
wet where'd that come from well th feet
 
07:28:58.110 --> 07:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
away there's a little map you have
 
07:29:00.388 --> 07:29:00.398 align:start position:0%
there's a wake booat with some kid who's
 
07:29:04.750 --> 07:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
trying to wake booat and he went about a
 
07:29:06.910 --> 07:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
100 yards and fell and so they circled
 
07:29:09.750 --> 07:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
around so now I'm watching and this wave
 
07:29:12.990 --> 07:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
and I kind of describe it as a tsunami
 
07:29:15.830 --> 07:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
type of wave because it's coming out of
 
07:29:18.628 --> 07:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
nowhere I am on the Eastern Shore so I'm
 
07:29:22.430 --> 07:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
very used to w waves and I watched this
 
07:29:25.910 --> 07:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
eight times this kid too bad didn't get
 
07:29:28.510 --> 07:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
up and get to really go further but it
 
07:29:32.308 --> 07:29:32.318 align:start position:0%
did create this random wave so in
 
07:29:35.150 --> 07:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
response to all of this I looked online
 
07:29:37.070 --> 07:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
and they were saying that a fully
 
07:29:41.070 --> 07:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
developed wake surfboat wake of 4 feet
 
07:29:42.788 --> 07:29:42.798 align:start position:0%
this is quoting from
 
07:29:46.510 --> 07:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
Google typically fipy developed 72 feet
 
07:29:49.510 --> 07:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
from the boat the wave would still be
 
07:29:55.990 --> 07:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
the 4ft wave at 430 ft would still be 2T
 
07:30:00.110 --> 07:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
high so a two I'm
 
07:30:06.468 --> 07:30:06.478 align:start position:0%
5T so if that wave at uh 500 ft
 
07:30:09.230 --> 07:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
is going to be a big wave could knock me
 
07:30:12.270 --> 07:30:12.280 align:start position:0%
down on the shore my sailboat is mored
 
07:30:17.788 --> 07:30:17.798 align:start position:0%
150 to 175 ft off the shore as are other
 
07:30:21.388 --> 07:30:21.398 align:start position:0%
rafts my concern is if a three or 4 foot
 
07:30:24.070 --> 07:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
wave comes and hits my boat broadside
 
07:30:26.430 --> 07:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
because it's not the wave isn't coming
 
07:30:28.670 --> 07:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
with the weather it's coming from the
 
07:30:31.270 --> 07:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
wave booat it could do considerable
 
07:30:34.388 --> 07:30:34.398 align:start position:0%
damage to the boat kids on a raft could
 
07:30:37.990 --> 07:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
get thrown off um and they could all get
 
07:30:38.000 --> 07:30:39.788 align:start position:0%
get thrown off um and they could all get
hurt

07:30:39.788 --> 07:30:39.798 align:start position:0%
hurt
 
07:30:42.910 --> 07:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
um the other question I have and I don't
 
07:30:45.430 --> 07:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
have an answer for this is in the ocean
 
07:30:49.670 --> 07:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
they say a 4ot wave that's 4ot mean so
 
07:30:52.708 --> 07:30:52.718 align:start position:0%
the trough it's 4 foot down and 4 foot
 
07:30:55.190 --> 07:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
up so I don't know if this is you know
 
07:30:56.868 --> 07:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
what the Wake boats are really creating
 
07:31:02.510 --> 07:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
in the lake is this but I'm in support
 
07:31:05.868 --> 07:31:05.878 align:start position:0%
of this bill to try and keep the waves
 
07:31:07.868 --> 07:31:07.878 align:start position:0%
further from Shore to
 
07:31:11.510 --> 07:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
protect kids kayakers
 
07:31:14.510 --> 07:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
paddlers um boats that are anchored and
 
07:31:17.308 --> 07:31:17.318 align:start position:0%
so forth thank you for your time thank
 
07:31:20.230 --> 07:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
you any questions by members of the
 
07:31:22.948 --> 07:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
committee seeing
 
07:31:25.548 --> 07:31:25.558 align:start position:0%
none hearing
 
07:31:29.308 --> 07:31:29.318 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:34.030 --> 07:31:34.040 align:start position:0%

07:31:42.788 --> 07:31:42.798 align:start position:0%
here she was at the parking meter when
 
07:31:44.388 --> 07:31:44.398 align:start position:0%
you called
 
07:31:44.398 --> 07:31:48.270 align:start position:0%
you called
her

07:31:48.270 --> 07:31:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:51.110 --> 07:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
huh no
 
07:31:56.628 --> 07:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:59.230 --> 07:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
testify did he
 
07:32:04.190 --> 07:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
testify if how in Elizabeth there's one
 
07:32:07.708 --> 07:32:07.718 align:start position:0%
that went to the parking to the park oh
 
07:32:10.150 --> 07:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
I wasn't aware of
 
07:32:10.160 --> 07:32:15.990 align:start position:0%
I wasn't aware of
that

07:32:15.990 --> 07:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:20.750 --> 07:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
huh I have not got a ride the card then
 
07:32:27.308 --> 07:32:27.318 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:29.548 --> 07:32:29.558 align:start position:0%

not

07:32:45.150 --> 07:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:58.548 --> 07:32:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:03.990 --> 07:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:07.708 --> 07:33:07.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:12.110 --> 07:33:12.120 align:start position:0%

well all right let's let's not go let's
 
07:33:18.150 --> 07:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
not overthink this
 
07:33:18.160 --> 07:33:24.750 align:start position:0%
not overthink this
folks

07:33:24.750 --> 07:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:30.830 --> 07:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:34.110 --> 07:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
found good afternoon soon to be good
 
07:33:37.110 --> 07:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
evening we've all been here a long time
 
07:33:39.948 --> 07:33:39.958 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of my points have already
 
07:33:41.830 --> 07:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
been spoken to but I've stuck it out as
 
07:33:43.628 --> 07:33:43.638 align:start position:0%
long as you guys have so we're going to
 
07:33:46.788 --> 07:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
go for it my name is BU gersen and I've
 
07:33:48.788 --> 07:33:48.798 align:start position:0%
lived on Lake walki Wan in Meredith New
 
07:33:51.430 --> 07:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the past 35 years I'm
 
07:33:55.150 --> 07:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
speaking in opposition of HB 1390 for
 
07:33:58.708 --> 07:33:58.718 align:start position:0%
the following reasons first the proposed
 
07:34:01.030 --> 07:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
bill will effectively eliminate the
 
07:34:03.468 --> 07:34:03.478 align:start position:0%
legal use of wake boats on dozens of
 
07:34:06.230 --> 07:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
midsize lakes in New Hampshire including
 
07:34:11.110 --> 07:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
ours Lake wwan spans 950 acres and has
 
07:34:13.430 --> 07:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
plenty of Open Water for multiple boats
 
07:34:16.150 --> 07:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
to do multiple activities while staying
 
07:34:18.788 --> 07:34:18.798 align:start position:0%
at least 200 ft from Shore and from each
 
07:34:18.798 --> 07:34:20.150 align:start position:0%
at least 200 ft from Shore and from each
other

07:34:20.150 --> 07:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
other
 
07:34:22.788 --> 07:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
but we have one big island in our Lake
 
07:34:25.868 --> 07:34:25.878 align:start position:0%
Which is less than 1,000 ft from Shore
 
07:34:28.910 --> 07:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
so this bill with its 500 foot setback
 
07:34:31.708 --> 07:34:31.718 align:start position:0%
on each side of the boat will restrict
 
07:34:35.030 --> 07:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
wake boats and wake Sports from using
 
07:34:38.030 --> 07:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
all the Open Water both in front and in
 
07:34:40.388 --> 07:34:40.398 align:start position:0%
back of the island because we will not
 
07:34:43.628 --> 07:34:43.638 align:start position:0%
legally be able to travel past the
 
07:34:46.750 --> 07:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
island similarly while our lake is an
 
07:34:49.868 --> 07:34:49.878 align:start position:0%
average of 40 ft deep there are spots
 
07:34:51.708 --> 07:34:51.718 align:start position:0%
near the center of our Lake that are
 
07:34:54.590 --> 07:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
less than the proposed 20ft depth
 
07:34:57.350 --> 07:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
minimum having to avoid these parts of
 
07:34:59.670 --> 07:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
the lake will increase the number of
 
07:35:02.270 --> 07:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
repetitive passes in certain sections of
 
07:35:04.868 --> 07:35:04.878 align:start position:0%
water rather than minimize them and it
 
07:35:08.788 --> 07:35:08.798 align:start position:0%
will create dangerous situations for all
 
07:35:12.468 --> 07:35:12.478 align:start position:0%
boers second the proposed legislation
 
07:35:15.468 --> 07:35:15.478 align:start position:0%
applies both to a type of boat and
 
07:35:18.230 --> 07:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
several specific activities related to
 
07:35:19.708 --> 07:35:19.718 align:start position:0%
water sports
 
07:35:21.510 --> 07:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
but wake boats are used for many
 
07:35:24.830 --> 07:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
activities not just wake Sports we use
 
07:35:27.030 --> 07:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
our boat for water skiing for wake

07:35:35.990 --> 07:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
filled and sometimes we don't if this
 
07:35:38.388 --> 07:35:38.398 align:start position:0%
bill passes some of our activities will
 
07:35:40.990 --> 07:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
be regulated one way and others will be
 
07:35:44.308 --> 07:35:44.318 align:start position:0%
regulated very differently it is
 
07:35:46.350 --> 07:35:46.360 align:start position:0%
inconsistent and
 
07:35:49.990 --> 07:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
unfair and unenforceable to be able to
 
07:35:53.590 --> 07:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
apply rules to a particular type of boat
 
07:35:55.590 --> 07:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
rather we should all obey the current
 
07:35:58.990 --> 07:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
setback limits and respect all boers and
 
07:36:01.750 --> 07:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
Shore owners to ensure safe enjoyable
 
07:36:04.110 --> 07:36:04.120 align:start position:0%
Lake access for
 
07:36:07.308 --> 07:36:07.318 align:start position:0%
everyone thirdly I've participated in
 
07:36:08.868 --> 07:36:08.878 align:start position:0%
these debates over the past several
 
07:36:11.430 --> 07:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
years and I have noticed that much of
 
07:36:14.030 --> 07:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
the dissent regarding weight boats grew
 
07:36:16.670 --> 07:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
originally from one group of people on
 
07:36:19.308 --> 07:36:19.318 align:start position:0%
one large New Hampshire Lake many of
 
07:36:21.150 --> 07:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
their complaints center around boats
 
07:36:24.070 --> 07:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
blasting loud music repeatedly circling
 
07:36:26.510 --> 07:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
the same section of water and not
 
07:36:29.628 --> 07:36:29.638 align:start position:0%
respecting the current 150ft setback
 
07:36:33.030 --> 07:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
limits from Shore or from other boats
 
07:36:35.430 --> 07:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
these are clearly undesirable boating
 
07:36:38.070 --> 07:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
behaviors but the offenders are not in
 
07:36:42.230 --> 07:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
any way limited to wake boats in fact
 
07:36:45.070 --> 07:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
pontoon boats account for a majority of
 
07:36:47.990 --> 07:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
new boat sails in the state these boats
 
07:36:50.230 --> 07:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
spend hours driving in circles
 
07:36:51.910 --> 07:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
specifically trying to rough up the
 
07:36:54.750 --> 07:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
water to create tubing Thrills they have
 
07:36:56.388 --> 07:36:56.398 align:start position:0%
big parties on the pontoon boats and
 
07:36:58.388 --> 07:36:58.398 align:start position:0%
they play loud music that can be heard
 
07:37:01.230 --> 07:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
all the way across the lake none of this
 
07:37:03.190 --> 07:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
disruption has anything to do with wake
 
07:37:06.110 --> 07:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
boats or wake Sports yet the proposed
 
07:37:07.910 --> 07:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
Bill does nothing to restrict this
 
07:37:07.920 --> 07:37:09.990 align:start position:0%
Bill does nothing to restrict this
undesirable

07:37:09.990 --> 07:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
undesirable
 
07:37:12.830 --> 07:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
behavior in conclusion New Hampshire
 
07:37:15.990 --> 07:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
Lakes are for everyone to enjoy safe
 
07:37:17.868 --> 07:37:17.878 align:start position:0%
respectful boating is everyone's
 
07:37:17.878 --> 07:37:19.590 align:start position:0%
respectful boating is everyone's
responsibility

07:37:19.590 --> 07:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
07:37:21.670 --> 07:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
but rather than create new laws that
 
07:37:24.910 --> 07:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
restrict one class of vote and ban wake
 
07:37:26.990 --> 07:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
Sports on many of New Hampshire's public
 
07:37:30.430 --> 07:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
Lakes the mission should be to educate
 
07:37:33.548 --> 07:37:33.558 align:start position:0%
to enforce current laws and to set a
 
07:37:35.270 --> 07:37:35.280 align:start position:0%

holderness during the summer months we
 
07:38:33.788 --> 07:38:33.798 align:start position:0%
are often on the lake kaying swimming

children are Avid water
 
07:38:40.750 --> 07:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
skiers our section of the lake has some
 
07:38:43.230 --> 07:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
of the heaviest usage by water skiers
 
07:38:45.670 --> 07:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
and we understand and support boers
 
07:38:47.628 --> 07:38:47.638 align:start position:0%
having fun on the
 
07:38:50.270 --> 07:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
lake in fact several years ago one of
 
07:38:51.910 --> 07:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
our neighbors applied for a permit to
 
07:38:53.948 --> 07:38:53.958 align:start position:0%
install a permanent submersible water
 
07:38:56.388 --> 07:38:56.398 align:start position:0%
skiing course the only one on the lake
 
07:38:59.150 --> 07:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
right in front of our place the
 
07:39:00.430 --> 07:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
department of the state that issues
 
07:39:02.230 --> 07:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
permits for this activity gave us the
 
07:39:05.070 --> 07:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
ability to object which we were told
 
07:39:07.510 --> 07:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
would likely have resulted in revocation
 
07:39:08.350 --> 07:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
of the
 
07:39:12.308 --> 07:39:12.318 align:start position:0%
permit we did not object I mention this
 
07:39:13.910 --> 07:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
because I would like those considering
 
07:39:16.070 --> 07:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
this statement testimony to have some
 
07:39:19.110 --> 07:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
context for our strong support support
 
07:39:19.990 --> 07:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
of this
 
07:39:23.110 --> 07:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
bill wake boating near the shore creates
 
07:39:26.830 --> 07:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
impacts on the lake and those who use it
 
07:39:29.670 --> 07:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
that are categorically different and
 
07:39:32.788 --> 07:39:32.798 align:start position:0%
more severe than any other kind of
 
07:39:32.798 --> 07:39:33.750 align:start position:0%
more severe than any other kind of
boating

07:39:33.750 --> 07:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
boating
 
07:39:36.110 --> 07:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
activity more
 
07:39:38.948 --> 07:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
specifically the erosion along sections
 
07:39:41.110 --> 07:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
of our Shoreline and by the way it's as
 
07:39:43.190 --> 07:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
an aside we live in the Northwest
 
07:39:46.948 --> 07:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
Quadrant of Squam so we do not suffer
 
07:39:49.030 --> 07:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
winds uh the prevailing winds are such
 
07:39:50.468 --> 07:39:50.478 align:start position:0%
that we are in the Lee of those
 
07:39:52.670 --> 07:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
prevailing winds the only winds that we
 
07:39:54.670 --> 07:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
have on our Shoreline are direct East
 
07:39:56.788 --> 07:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
Winds during a
 
07:39:59.868 --> 07:39:59.878 align:start position:0%
storm and the erosion on along sections
 
07:40:02.468 --> 07:40:02.478 align:start position:0%
of our Shoreline not fully protected by
 
07:40:05.788 --> 07:40:05.798 align:start position:0%
large rocks has been visible and
 
07:40:08.868 --> 07:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
obvious we are literally watching parts
 
07:40:11.628 --> 07:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
of our Shoreline be eaten away after
 
07:40:14.468 --> 07:40:14.478 align:start position:0%
just 3 years of heavy wake
 
07:40:16.670 --> 07:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
boating we know this impact is
 
07:40:18.708 --> 07:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
attributable to wake boating since since
 
07:40:20.830 --> 07:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
the erosion occurred after wake boats
 
07:40:23.110 --> 07:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
began regularly operating close to our
 
07:40:25.230 --> 07:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
Shoreline in
 
07:40:27.830 --> 07:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
2020 the wakes from these boats are so
 
07:40:29.830 --> 07:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
large that we sometimes are unable to
 
07:40:33.030 --> 07:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
use our dock the wakes are large and
 
07:40:35.308 --> 07:40:35.318 align:start position:0%
powerful enough to lift sections of the
 
07:40:38.270 --> 07:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
cedar decking that sits on top of the
 
07:40:42.750 --> 07:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
aluminum dock frame completely off the
 
07:40:44.910 --> 07:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
frame we are unable to have our
 
07:40:46.750 --> 07:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
motorboat tied to our dock when wake
 
07:40:49.468 --> 07:40:49.478 align:start position:0%
boating is in heaviest use
 
07:40:51.388 --> 07:40:51.398 align:start position:0%
as the cycling of the Wake boats back
 
07:40:53.230 --> 07:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
and forth in front of our dock creates
 
07:40:56.070 --> 07:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
such violent turbulence and force that
 
07:40:58.270 --> 07:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
the only reliable way to keep our boat
 
07:41:00.510 --> 07:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
from crashing into the dock is to Moore
 
07:41:01.510 --> 07:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
it on a
 
07:41:04.030 --> 07:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
moing we are advised by the company that
 
07:41:05.628 --> 07:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
handles most dock repair and
 
07:41:07.788 --> 07:41:07.798 align:start position:0%
installation on Squam that the only
 
07:41:09.830 --> 07:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
reliable way to keep our boat from
 
07:41:13.070 --> 07:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
literally battering itself or our dock
 
07:41:16.510 --> 07:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
to Pieces was to install a new moing as
 
07:41:18.830 --> 07:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
whips would not be sufficient to to hold
 
07:41:21.110 --> 07:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
our boat off the dock given the size of
 
07:41:24.868 --> 07:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:27.350 --> 07:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
generated during periods of heavy wake
 
07:41:30.270 --> 07:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
booat usage we are unable to launch
 
07:41:32.468 --> 07:41:32.478 align:start position:0%
kayaks from our shore or have our young
 
07:41:35.868 --> 07:41:35.878 align:start position:0%
grandchildren Wade along the
 
07:41:38.948 --> 07:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
shore the wakes from Wake booat cycling
 
07:41:41.788 --> 07:41:41.798 align:start position:0%
back and forth 4 hours in front of our
 
07:41:45.030 --> 07:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
dock are far too destabilizing to allow
 
07:41:48.150 --> 07:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
it this is not the case when we have
 
07:41:52.670 --> 07:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:54.750 --> 07:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
occurring we have noticed that over the
 
07:41:56.510 --> 07:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
past summer or two a few wake booat
 
07:41:58.830 --> 07:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
operators in fact a number uh many many
 
07:42:01.990 --> 07:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
of them have thankfully woken up to the
 
07:42:04.388 --> 07:42:04.398 align:start position:0%
realities of the harms inflicted by
 
07:42:07.150 --> 07:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
their boats and shifted their operation
 
07:42:08.788 --> 07:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
away from the shoreline and toward the
 
07:42:10.350 --> 07:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
middle of the
 
07:42:13.110 --> 07:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
lake I have a hard time understanding
 
07:42:15.350 --> 07:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
the basis for principled opposition to
 
07:42:18.350 --> 07:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
this bill as I've seen responsible own
 
07:42:20.270 --> 07:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
owners of these boats demonstrate
 
07:42:23.670 --> 07:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
regularly that they can operate and have
 
07:42:26.548 --> 07:42:26.558 align:start position:0%
fun with their boats in a manner fully
 
07:42:29.190 --> 07:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
consistent with this
 
07:42:31.628 --> 07:42:31.638 align:start position:0%
legislation I hope that legislators will
 
07:42:34.788 --> 07:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
see through empty appeals to individual
 
07:42:37.670 --> 07:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
rights and protect our Lakes our
 
07:42:40.708 --> 07:42:40.718 align:start position:0%

Lake oichi I've been a lakeef front odor
 
07:44:05.110 --> 07:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
for 20 years um and I just wanted to
 
07:44:08.468 --> 07:44:08.478 align:start position:0%
address the Waterfront we have over 200
 
07:44:09.548 --> 07:44:09.558 align:start position:0%
ft of
 
07:44:12.590 --> 07:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
Waterfront a couple of winters ago they
 
07:44:15.868 --> 07:44:15.878 align:start position:0%
decided to drop the water on Lake oichi
 
07:44:18.868 --> 07:44:18.878 align:start position:0%
a foot under the ice as I watched my
 
07:44:20.548 --> 07:44:20.558 align:start position:0%
neighbor's ice rank that had been
 
07:44:24.308 --> 07:44:24.318 align:start position:0%
shoveled off travel from their house
 
07:44:27.388 --> 07:44:27.398 align:start position:0%
past our house on the lake the ice
 
07:44:30.308 --> 07:44:30.318 align:start position:0%
shifted that much I had icebergs on my
 
07:44:32.270 --> 07:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
Waterfront this
 
07:44:34.868 --> 07:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
High huge icebergs all over the
 
07:44:37.948 --> 07:44:37.958 align:start position:0%
Waterfront our neighbor tree fell in the
 
07:44:41.308 --> 07:44:41.318 align:start position:0%
lake and I just wanted to attest that
 
07:44:44.510 --> 07:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
ice and wind are causing more damage to
 
07:44:47.150 --> 07:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
our waterfronts than the Wake boats
 
07:44:50.070 --> 07:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
especially if we boarding is done
 
07:44:52.430 --> 07:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
respectfully thank you for your time
 
07:44:56.910 --> 07:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:01.708 --> 07:45:01.718 align:start position:0%

good see that there's no one uh else who
 
07:45:15.548 --> 07:45:15.558 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak
 
07:45:18.990 --> 07:45:19.000 align:start position:0%

Lake oichi also not far from where the
 
07:45:27.510 --> 07:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
Shel live um so
 
07:45:29.868 --> 07:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
we I've been making some notes as I'm
 
07:45:33.510 --> 07:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
listening I didn't plan to speak so
 
07:45:36.510 --> 07:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
I some things come up other than the
 
07:45:40.628 --> 07:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
science and the technology and the um
 
07:45:42.948 --> 07:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
the the statistics that are thrown at
 
07:45:46.110 --> 07:45:46.120 align:start position:0%
you I've been a boa my whole life I'm 73
 
07:45:49.670 --> 07:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
years old been Bo since I'm
 
07:45:52.590 --> 07:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
nine the first 30 some odd years I was
 
07:45:56.270 --> 07:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
in the ocean and now 42 years here in
 
07:45:59.350 --> 07:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:03.548 --> 07:46:03.558 align:start position:0%
Region courtesy and Common Sense means
 
07:46:06.628 --> 07:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
more than anything else that you could
 
07:46:08.430 --> 07:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
put into
 
07:46:11.030 --> 07:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
law I've seen the most unbelievable
 
07:46:12.830 --> 07:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
ridiculous things going
 
07:46:15.708 --> 07:46:15.718 align:start position:0%
on that could solve a lot of
 
07:46:18.230 --> 07:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
problems I won't get into details but if
 
07:46:19.510 --> 07:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
any of you have ever been on the water
 
07:46:24.388 --> 07:46:24.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:26.468 --> 07:46:26.478 align:start position:0%
yourselves traveling down the middle of
 
07:46:29.150 --> 07:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
OPI which is not a big lake about a half
 
07:46:31.590 --> 07:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
a mile wide from my house across the the
 
07:46:37.030 --> 07:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:39.510 --> 07:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
Lake when we're water skiing up and down
 
07:46:42.388 --> 07:46:42.398 align:start position:0%
the middle which is what we always do we
 
07:46:44.030 --> 07:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
stay away from the shoreline we have
 
07:46:45.708 --> 07:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
enough common sense for that we don't
 
07:46:48.910 --> 07:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
need to be regulated for that it's just
 
07:46:53.070 --> 07:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
courtesy so many times I'll see a canoe
 
07:46:56.270 --> 07:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
a kayaker just sitting in the
 
07:47:00.030 --> 07:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
middle and giving us frowns or dirty
 
07:47:02.468 --> 07:47:02.478 align:start position:0%
looks well they have a right to be there
 
07:47:05.110 --> 07:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
and so do we but there's some common
 
07:47:07.708 --> 07:47:07.718 align:start position:0%
sense about it there's plenty of Lake if
 
07:47:10.590 --> 07:47:10.600 align:start position:0%
you see a water skier go by or if you
 
07:47:13.430 --> 07:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
see a surfboat go by don't try to stay
 
07:47:15.910 --> 07:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
in their Lane there's no law against it
 
07:47:19.308 --> 07:47:19.318 align:start position:0%
but it just courtesy and Common Sense
 
07:47:20.910 --> 07:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
I've seen it we have a slalom course on
 
07:47:23.830 --> 07:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
the north end of our Lake how many times
 
07:47:26.030 --> 07:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
we would travel to go up there to use it
 
07:47:28.150 --> 07:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
and to be a person with no wind with a
 
07:47:31.030 --> 07:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
sailfish sitting in the middle of it no
 
07:47:32.510 --> 07:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
reason to be
 
07:47:35.350 --> 07:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
there so my point is courtesy and Common
 
07:47:38.190 --> 07:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
Sense goes a long way and that can
 
07:47:40.868 --> 07:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
happen through the education part of the
 
07:47:42.708 --> 07:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
earlier Bill we some of the others had
 
07:47:42.718 --> 07:47:44.468 align:start position:0%
earlier Bill we some of the others had
spoken

07:47:44.468 --> 07:47:44.478 align:start position:0%
spoken
 
07:47:47.430 --> 07:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
about and not to mention but I will
 
07:47:47.440 --> 07:47:48.628 align:start position:0%
about and not to mention but I will
mention

07:47:48.628 --> 07:47:48.638 align:start position:0%
mention
 
07:47:51.070 --> 07:47:51.080 align:start position:0%
that canoers and kayakers and I'm one of
 
07:47:53.388 --> 07:47:53.398 align:start position:0%
them also we have a rack full of those
 
07:47:56.308 --> 07:47:56.318 align:start position:0%
for us and our guests I'm not opposed to
 
07:47:58.830 --> 07:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
any any use of
 
07:48:01.388 --> 07:48:01.398 align:start position:0%
it but there's no registration fee for
 
07:48:02.388 --> 07:48:02.398 align:start position:0%
any of those
 
07:48:05.510 --> 07:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
boats we pay a fee for the boats we use
 
07:48:08.468 --> 07:48:08.478 align:start position:0%
surfboats ski boats jet
 
07:48:10.910 --> 07:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
skis but there's no skin in the game
 
07:48:12.590 --> 07:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
when it comes to money to a kayaker or a
 
07:48:14.510 --> 07:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
canoe or somebody with a
 
07:48:16.750 --> 07:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
sailfish there used to be years ago from
 
07:48:18.388 --> 07:48:18.398 align:start position:0%
what I believe origin registration fee
 
07:48:20.510 --> 07:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
but there isn't any longer that might be
 
07:48:22.190 --> 07:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
something the committee might want to
 
07:48:22.200 --> 07:48:23.868 align:start position:0%
something the committee might want to
think

07:48:23.868 --> 07:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
think
 
07:48:23.878 --> 07:48:26.150 align:start position:0%
think
about

07:48:26.150 --> 07:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:48:28.910 --> 07:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
so to sum it up
 
07:48:32.750 --> 07:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
courtesy and and Common Sense is what's
 
07:48:35.990 --> 07:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
needed by Boat Owners all Boat Owners
 
07:48:39.230 --> 07:48:39.240 align:start position:0%

07:48:42.308 --> 07:48:42.318 align:start position:0%
