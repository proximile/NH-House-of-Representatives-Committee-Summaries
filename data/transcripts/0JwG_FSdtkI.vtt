00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
a short prehistory
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
playing board decision in portsmouth
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
decided to
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
green light a new construction building
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
which was appealed by several residents
 
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
of the of portsmouth
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
under the under the with the um
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
contention that
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
two members on that planning board
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
two exoficio members on that planning
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
board were in fact not residents of this
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
of the municipality
 
00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
and as they saw the law written
 
00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:57.350 align:start position:0%
and as they saw the law written
all

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
members on municipal boards land use
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
boards are required to be members
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
or residents of that municipality
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
they appeal that ruling to the superior
 
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.990 align:start position:0%
they appeal that ruling to the superior
court

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
and the superior court said well
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
it is true that
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
a regular members are required to be
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
residents of the municipality
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
but exoficio members are not
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
not explicitly mentioned in the rsa
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
and so therefore it is assumed that they
 
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
also can vote
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
even if they're not members even if
 
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 align:start position:0%
they're not residents of the
 
00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:36.230 align:start position:0%
they're not residents of the
municipality

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is it changes
 
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
that rsa to say
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
a municipality can establish such boards
 
00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:46.550 align:start position:0%
a municipality can establish such boards
but

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
voting members on that board must be
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
must be residents of the municipality
 
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
and this includes exophisio members as
 
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.990 align:start position:0%
and this includes exophisio members as
well

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
so it explicitly mentions that so that
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
that corrects that error which most
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
people thought that these boards were
 
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.070 align:start position:0%
people thought that these boards were
all

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
manned by people who were residents of
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
the municipality and it doesn't preclude
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
ex-official members who don't live in
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
the municipality from being on these
 
00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:15.759 align:start position:0%
boards and advising these boards however
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
it prevents them from voting when it
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
comes to the voting rights the
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
municipal association contacted me and
 
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
said we should make an exception in this
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
bill and it has been made in a certain
 
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.629 align:start position:0%
bill and it has been made in a certain
section

00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
to exclude building inspectors because
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
there are many smaller towns in new
 
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.589 align:start position:0%
there are many smaller towns in new
hampshire

00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:34.630 align:start position:0%
hampshire
that

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
share a building inspector with another
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
town and that building inspector should
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
be part of that board when they make
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
decisions because that is integral to to
 
00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.110 align:start position:0%
decisions because that is integral to to
the

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
function of that that particular person
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
so that's what the bill is all about it
 
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
was requested by a resident of
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
portsmouth that i submit to spill on his
 
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.509 align:start position:0%
portsmouth that i submit to spill on his
behalf

00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
behalf
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions from his
 
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.670 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions from his
representative

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is sounding kind of familiar
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
um i was checking my notes
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
and saw that previously there was
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
hb 392
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
this term which
 
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.470 align:start position:0%
this term which
did

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
something similar um could you explain
 
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.910 align:start position:0%
something similar um could you explain
um

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
what happened with that one and like
 
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.190 align:start position:0%
what happened with that one and like
why

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
and like compare and contrast this one
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative callier for
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
that question uh the answer is pretty
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
simple uh this was submitted uh last
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
year but it died in the house it never
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
got a vote in the house and that's why
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
it's allowed to be brought back again
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
because it was there was no vote in the
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
house on the bill
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tripp
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman thank you for
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:05.509 align:start position:0%
taking my question
uh

00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
how many members are there on a planning
 
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.910 align:start position:0%
how many members are there on a planning
board

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
i really can't answer that because i
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
think every municipality is a little
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
different as far as i know and it and
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
this is not just about one board it's
 
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.350 align:start position:0%
this is not just about one board it's
multiple

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
land use boards in various towns and
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
municipalities so i don't know exactly
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
what the if there's a fixed number or
 
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.710 align:start position:0%
what the if there's a fixed number or
not

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
all right well uh follow up go ahead
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.670 align:start position:0%
 
are

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
my understanding is most are appointed
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
yes and the ex-officio members are
 
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
there because of a a
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
function they fulfill with the
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
municipality and the municipality wants
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
them part of that board
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
but the other ones are all appointed and
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
the ex-officio members are
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
staff members or people on the municipal
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
municipal payroll perhaps but some of
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
them in in the case of portsmouth we
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
have people who live in newberry port
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
massachusetts who are ex-official
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
members who were ex-official members on
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.470 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
testimony it's my understanding uh that
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
where the planning boards are either
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
elected or appointed
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
this would not change that that the
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
communities that
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
require that a person
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.519 --> 00:12:18.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
that's exactly correct what you're
 
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.629 align:start position:0%
that's exactly correct what you're
saying

00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
and in our town we don't we don't elect
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
them they are appointed but i can see
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
that in some municipalities they will or
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
we would be elected so that wouldn't
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
affect any any any other feature of of
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
this of the way people are elected to
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
these boards or appointed no
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
representative manjuputi nice to see you
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you representative for
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
presenting this bill so my question is
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
like you already stated it applies to
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
all different boards
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
correct so the statute changing or the
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
rsa change in the rsa
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
will only include
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
the extra fischer if they're not living
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
in that and if they have to be elected
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
then they won't qualify but if it is an
 
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.269 align:start position:0%
then they won't qualify but if it is an
appointed

00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
they can
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
be a contributing member
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
it could be any board right
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh it's the the
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking about rsa title um
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
was it lx i5 which is like
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
64. planning and zoning boards so not
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
all boards but planning and zoning
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
boards yes
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
and uh uh you know the the only
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
difference is that we're saying
 
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.790 align:start position:0%
difference is that we're saying
specifically

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.829 align:start position:0%
specifically
that

00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
you have to be a resident of
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
municipality whether you're exophysio or
 
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.430 align:start position:0%
municipality whether you're exophysio or
not

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
that's the only time you can vote with
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
the only exception being building
 
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.790 align:start position:0%
the only exception being building
inspectors

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative powell
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question is
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
it true that ex-officio members
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
had previously served on these um said
 
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.150 align:start position:0%
had previously served on these um said
boards

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
um why would you
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
uh exclude building inspectors
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
i understand the function of the
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
building inspector as a
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
giving advice to the planning board
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
zoning board whatever
 
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.710 align:start position:0%
zoning board whatever
but

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.509 align:start position:0%
but
i

00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:01.519 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
really question whether a building
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
inspector should
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
cast a vote if they if they're not
 
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.069 align:start position:0%
cast a vote if they if they're not
residents

00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
residents
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
i just i am interested in your reasoning
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you representative
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
for that question um
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
i can't say i know
 
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
enough about building inspectors to
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
thoroughly but the municipal association
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
was quite
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
building inspectors that are shared by
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
multiple municipalities
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
should have a say in those decisions
 
00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:43.670 align:start position:0%
should have a say in those decisions
um

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.470 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know exactly how that works and
 
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
why why it's so important uh most like
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
the towns i'm familiar with they have
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
their own building inspector and that
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
person does not have to be
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
on those land use sports it's dependent
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
on the municipality to appoint them
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
so uh i i think it's probably true for
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
other municipalities if they decide to
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
put this person on the board
 
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
and he's a building inspector then he
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
would be allowed to vote according to
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
this bill if if they don't put him on
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
the board he's not going to be voting
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
and of course i think it's very
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
important to remember that ex-official
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
members often have a lot of
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
institutional memory so that these land
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
use sports do want to hear from them and
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
often get advice from them
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean they have to be
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
voting members unless they
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question my
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
apologies but could you briefly restate
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
the case that you cited
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
when you began your testimony i i didn't
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
hear all of it
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
this was in 2020
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
and this was a planning board decision
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
in portsmouth
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
the local planning board made a decision
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
and there were
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
the decision was
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
included two votes by ex-officio members
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
decision was challenged by several
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
residents of portsmouth and went to the
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
the superior court said
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
while it does there the statute does
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
refer to
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
requirement of residency as members on
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
those boards it doesn't specifically
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
exclude ex-officio members which is a
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
different quasi-different kind of
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
membership they're they're members
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
because of other services or positions
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
they have and since
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
the the statute doesn't specifically
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
mention them
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
the the superior court said they should
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
be allowed to vote
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
and and this this bill basically
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
corrects that by saying uh unless they
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
are in fact uh municipal residents they
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be voting
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh and like i said the only exclusion
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
being building
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
are these microphones shutting off
 
00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:33.350 align:start position:0%
are these microphones shutting off
automatically

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.430 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
this whole thing with the uh uh
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
even even the the thing with the having
 
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
a building inspector being part of the
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
board is a little bit fuddling to me
 
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:46.789 align:start position:0%
board is a little bit fuddling to me
if

00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
if it's elected then obviously they
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
members of the community if they're
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
then uh
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility they wouldn't be
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
members of the community
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh this is our question there's a i'm
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
i'm creating the context thank you
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
but thank you for uh prompting me
 
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.549 align:start position:0%
but thank you for uh prompting me
uh

00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:14.150 align:start position:0%
uh
why

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
why would a uh a town
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
or a city
 
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.390 align:start position:0%
or a city
appoint

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
appoint
 
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
a non-resident to a uh
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr uh thank you representative
 
00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.270 align:start position:0%
thank you mr uh thank you representative
tripp

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
tripp
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
you got me there
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
any municipality
 
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.710 align:start position:0%
any municipality
having

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
boards that make decisions for that
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
municipality should have members that
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
are residents of that municipality makes
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense to me
 
00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.750 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense to me
unless

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
unless
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
they have people involved who are just
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
there for advisory purposes which i can
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
another question uh
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
well that that's the thing that uh like
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
i said is confusing to me because you
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
can have advisory people
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
present at a meeting
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
without having them members of the board
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
the site the case you cited that
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
the portsmouth created their own problem
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh i know i i i i think this is a
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
problem that's statewide
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
because i think like the court said
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh the role of ex-officio members was
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
not specifically mentioned in the
 
00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.029 align:start position:0%
not specifically mentioned in the
statute

00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
and i would not be surprised that this
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
is a problem yes portsmouth created but
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
they assumed this was proper and i am
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
assuming that there are other
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities that do the same thing
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
and no one has challenged that at all
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
before so i can't be
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
sure about it but that's what i suspect
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative samsich
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative samsich am i correct
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
in reading this bill as saying
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
that all voting members of local land
 
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
use boards shall be residents so whether
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
the building inspector comes to the
 
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.909 align:start position:0%
the building inspector comes to the
meeting

00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
if he or she is not a resident they
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
cannot be a voting member that's what
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and that
 
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.990 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and that
question

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's not quite correct uh you notice
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
it says pursuant to paragraph one two
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
and four
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
and five
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
and there's a there's a paragraph roman
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
number three
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
which is excluded that's the building
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
inspector part
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
so everything except the building
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
yes please could i have a follow-up
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:16.950 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
so a building inspector can be appointed
 
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.549 align:start position:0%
so a building inspector can be appointed
to

00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
a local land use board even if he lives
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
or she lives in the next town over
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
and can vote according to this
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
you did shut off i have one question for
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
you um
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
most uh
 
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
towns will use uh ex-officials
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
especially for planning boards and
 
00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.149 align:start position:0%
especially for planning boards and
sony's

00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
sony's
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
that i've known uh are
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
all appointed to begin with okay
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
um the ex-officios on those boards
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
uh do not have voting rights
 
00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:05.669 align:start position:0%
uh do not have voting rights
and

00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
so you're claiming that a building
 
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
inspector should have
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
building rights i mean voting rights on
 
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.870 align:start position:0%
building rights i mean voting rights on
those

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for this question
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding from what the municipal
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
association shared with me is that when
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
we exclude them
 
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.470 align:start position:0%
we exclude them
from

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
this mandate that
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
that only residents are allowed to
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
to vote on these boards
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
i think that doesn't preclude
 
00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:38.070 align:start position:0%
i think that doesn't preclude
uh

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
the local municipality
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
allowing them to participate and maybe
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
even vote i don't know
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
specifically if they say so
 
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
right now however as the laws are as the
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
rsas are written
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
their role is pretty vague so that's i
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
think why probably some municipalities
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
don't let them vote and others let them
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
vote that's my suspicion
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for this
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
representative samsic so let's see if i
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
have this correct this time
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
am i correct in believing that your bill
 
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.750 align:start position:0%
am i correct in believing that your bill
says

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
says

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%

residents of the town except
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
in the case where the town appoints a
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
is that what it says yes
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:39.430 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
there any other questions for this
 
00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.070 align:start position:0%
there any other questions for this
witness

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
witness
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
representative stavis sorry thank you mr
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
sharon thank you representative for
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
so even if said building inspector
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
was duly appointed to said board
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
well first of all thank you for the
 
00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:05.590 align:start position:0%
well first of all thank you for the
question

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
if the building inspector is a resident
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
of the town
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
or municipality yes they can vote
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
but that's different from what we just
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
heard i think well if if they're
 
00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.390 align:start position:0%
heard i think well if if they're
appointed

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
to that land use board and they are
 
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
residents or even as ex-officio members
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't preclude them from voting
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
the the title of ex-officio itself does
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
not preclude them from voting it's the
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
question of whether
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
they are residents of the municipality
 
00:25:34.559 --> 00:25:35.510 align:start position:0%
they are residents of the municipality
and

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.390 align:start position:0%
and
uh

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
the only exclu the the
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
the only exception to not being a
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
resident is if you're a
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
a building inspector that is shared by a
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
town with other towns
 
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
where they can't be the resident of all
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
i see none i'm gonna close the hearing
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%

thank you very much
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.029 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
oh i didn't see that i'm sorry i can't
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
close the hearing
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
this is uh
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
natchez from
 
00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.070 align:start position:0%
natchez from
nhma

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
nhma
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
sorry about that i apologize no problem
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
mr chair i put that in about halfway
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
through because there were uh
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
some things that i just wanted to
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
clarify for the committee uh nate graves
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire municipal
 
00:26:33.679 --> 00:26:34.870 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire municipal
association

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
we do not have a position on this bill
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
i just want to clarify that this bill
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
modifies rsa 673 colon 1
 
00:26:42.799 --> 00:26:43.750 align:start position:0%
modifies rsa 673 colon 1
which

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.750 align:start position:0%
which
designates

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
designates
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
membership of land use boards it also
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
provides for some other land use
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
items such as the building inspector so
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
the building inspector is covered under
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
rsa 673-1 roman 3 and it and that
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
portion of the statute just says the
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
local legislative body
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
may provide for the
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
appointment of an inspector of all
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
buildings that doesn't provide that the
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
building inspector actually serves on a
 
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.390 align:start position:0%
building inspector actually serves on a
board

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
the land use boards are other roman
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
numerals under that statute
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
essentially what this would
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
this bill would do is simply rewrite
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
the requirements there's already a
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
residency requirement that the
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
members of land use boards be
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
residents of the municipality and it
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
would it would just sort of shift where
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
that language comes into the statutes
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
i think there was a little bit of
 
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
confusion about what exofficio means so
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to use an example here
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
so a planning board at a town
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
is comprised of five to seven members
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
plus one ex-official member who's either
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
a member of the select board or an
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
administrative official
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
appointed by the select board and that's
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
found under 673 colon two
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
um and that ex-officio serves as
 
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.630 align:start position:0%
um and that ex-officio serves as
um

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
essentially a representative of that of
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
the select board
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
of that other board um and has all the
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
rights and privileges of any other board
 
00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.510 align:start position:0%
rights and privileges of any other board
member

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
you know if it's a select board member
 
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a requirement the
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
select board be a resident of the town
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
if it's an administrative official that
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
may not necessarily be the case
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
but the building inspector generally
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
isn't going to serve on a land use board
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
simply because their role
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
isn't really to make decisions about
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
people's individual rights it's to go in
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
and say hey you know
 
00:28:40.399 --> 00:28:41.350 align:start position:0%
and say hey you know
your

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
whatever on your building isn't to code
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's too close you know the setback
 
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.310 align:start position:0%
it's it's too close you know the setback
is

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
is not far enough or whatever the case
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
may be
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
so we're really just talking about
 
00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:52.149 align:start position:0%
so we're really just talking about
um

00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
the people making land use decisions for
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
residents of the town
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%

the prime sponsor um is unable to be

here at this time so i've been asked to

introduce the bill to the committee so
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
amends the definition of veteran
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%

this is the position of the department

that the state should make its myriad of

respectfully asks the committee to

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
do you have any statistics on how many
 
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.230 align:start position:0%
do you have any statistics on how many
uh

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
veterans under honor discharge under
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
honorable circumstances are in new
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire versus veterans who are
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
honorably discharged can what what is
 
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.589 align:start position:0%
honorably discharged can what what is
the

00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
what are the statistics there
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that number is not an easy
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
number to come to
 
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.190 align:start position:0%
number to come to
um

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
veterans are not required to check in
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
with the division of veteran services
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
when they enter the state
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
um and there is really no way to track
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the system whether or not their what
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
their discharge is
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
um i have asked va for data
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
that may help
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
define that a little bit give us some
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
numbers because veterans who apply for
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
services that are general under
 
00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.510 align:start position:0%
services that are general under
honorable

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
honorable
 
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
i could probably get a a list of all
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
those veterans from the va um but that's
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
only going to be veterans who actually
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
apply for benefits so if a veteran is in
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire and they
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
haven't applied for benefits their name
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
is not going to be on the list so they
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be counted so it's not a very
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
easy number to come to
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
follow would you follow up go ahead so
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
if it's not an easy number to come by
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
what could be the ramifications
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
of expanding the definition under this
 
00:40:48.079 --> 00:40:49.190 align:start position:0%
of expanding the definition under this
bill

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.390 align:start position:0%
bill
um

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
and how would
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
state officials in charge of
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
enforcing this bill
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
like i said
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
to get the exact number of general under
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
audibles is not going to be an easy
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
number to come by
 
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
but not all general honorables are going
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for all benefits in the
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire for example
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
property tax credits
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
not everybody who's general under
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
honourable is going to own a home
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
so to determine how many of those are
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
going to want to get property tax credit
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
it'd be very difficult to ascertain uh
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
there definitely will be an impact on
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
um because there are
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
obviously general under honorables that
 
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
are not receiving benefits now
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
there'll be more people more general
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
animals looking to get veterans plates
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
which as right now they're not eligible
 
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.510 align:start position:0%
which as right now they're not eligible
for

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
there will be more general honorable
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
veterans who will now have the ability
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
to go to the veterans cemetery be buried
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
in the various cemetery which they
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
cannot be buried today more veterans
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
will have the ability to utilize the
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
veterans home
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
general under animals cannot so there
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
will be some impact
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to think the impact would
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
not be a negative impact
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
oh um representative power already kind
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
of asked my question for me but um
 
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.150 align:start position:0%
of asked my question for me but um
since

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.990 align:start position:0%
since
i

i
 
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:12.950 align:start position:0%
i
since

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
i was still kind of unclear on
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
what could you spell your last name for
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
us as well just for note-taking purposes
 
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.109 align:start position:0%
us as well just for note-taking purposes
yes

00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
the last name is spelled g-a-u
 
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:30.470 align:start position:0%
the last name is spelled g-a-u
d-r-e-a-u

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
okay representative cleve
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
just for clarifications this just
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
changes our current statute here in new
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire to match the federal language
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
is that the only change that you see
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
happening thank you for the question is
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
that that is correct okay and may i have
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
a follow-up sir
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you so much um the the
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
language on um
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
page one
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
that references it's around line 16
 
00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.230 align:start position:0%
that references it's around line 16
um

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's 15 and 16 that says um
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
that for the state who have served in
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
the armed forces of the united states
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
for not less than 90 days in times of
 
00:43:13.359 --> 00:43:14.390 align:start position:0%
for not less than 90 days in times of
war

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
war
 
00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.510 align:start position:0%
war
um

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
that would have been
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
for instance something to say like
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
vietnam veterans or something that may
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
be only served 90 days for whatever
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
their reason wasn't got got a discharge
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
is is that correct that is correct and
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
does not include um reservists that
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
possibly have served over 90 days
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
during their training when they're
 
00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.870 align:start position:0%
during their training when they're
active

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
active
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
that is correct okay thank you so much
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
your testimony bill
 
00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.030 align:start position:0%
your testimony bill
uh

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
i i got sort of a dumb question maybe
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
but can you tell me is this bill more
 
00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.430 align:start position:0%
but can you tell me is this bill more
restrictive

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
restrictive
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
or less restrictive as far as
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
a candidate being
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
a person going to looking for an
 
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.190 align:start position:0%
a person going to looking for an
abatement

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
abatement
 
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the thank you for the
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
question this will be less restrictive
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
as it stands right now if you separate
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
the military with a general under
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
honorable discharge you are not eligible
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
for state benefits
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
as a veteran you're not considered a
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
veteran in the state of new hampshire
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
so this bill would eliminate that and
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
because you're general under honorable
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
conditions your honorable conditions you
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
would then be
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
eligible for state benefits in the state
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire so it would definitely
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
be inclusive or additive a follow-up mr
 
00:44:30.319 --> 00:44:31.670 align:start position:0%
be inclusive or additive a follow-up mr
chairman

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
so it's fair to say that those who are
 
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.510 align:start position:0%
so it's fair to say that those who are
already

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
already on the rolls if you're willing
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
for the abatement there
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
there's no change for them so but it
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
might add some
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
other veterans who don't qualify because
 
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
of the way the uh the description of
 
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
what a veteran
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
is is that correct thank you for the
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
clarification that is correct and we
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
what that number is it might yes i'm
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
sorry mr chairman a follow-up uh
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
we don't know whether there's in the
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
community whether there's two or ten
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say that that's not going
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
to be uh a large number
 
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
in each community
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
i don't imagine the number is going to
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
be too large but i do know that there
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
are definitely some people out there
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
that are affected by this currently
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you thank you mr
 
00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:26.870 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you thank you mr
chairman

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
how would this impact
 
00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:32.390 align:start position:0%
how would this impact
homeless

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
homeless
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
veterans or veterans that don't like you
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
said the own not every veteran owns a
 
00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:39.910 align:start position:0%
said the own not every veteran owns a
home

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
but they might be
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
eligible for some of the
 
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
other benefits that you
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
allude to
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
so how would that impact our veteran
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
population in our state
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the only way
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to impact the homeless
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
veteran is if the homeless veteran is
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
generally under honorable if the veteran
 
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
is currently homeless and is honorably
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
separate separated they'd be available
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
eligible for all benefits that are for
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
the honorable veterans if they are a
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
veteran who is generally under honorably
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
separated and they are homeless they
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
would not be eligible for state benefits
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
that might assist them
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that they are
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
generally under honorable
 
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.349 align:start position:0%
generally under honorable
one

00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
many especially i'm looking at the
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
health benefits
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know some homeless might
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
not be capable of applying for it
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
because of their state of mind or their
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
homeless and combination of it
 
00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.230 align:start position:0%
homeless and combination of it
and

if they are homeless they don't have the
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%

the question i'm not really sure i
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
understand the question um
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
this this law this law is specifically
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
looking to bring in a group of veterans
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
into the veteran status that have not
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
been in the veterans status before
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not really sure how it affects what
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
you're speaking about
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
if i can clarify my question mr chair
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me if i can clarify my question
 
00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.549 align:start position:0%
excuse me if i can clarify my question
to

00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead um in order to be qualified or
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
to be established as a veteran honorable
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
general right you have to have certain
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
documents and stuff if somebody is
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
homeless and i'm not able to
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
provide those
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
that would be an issue correct
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
that would be an issue but an issue not
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
not rectified through this legislation
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
my question has to do with
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
what is a
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
general discharge
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
under honorable and i i assume there are
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
general discharges under dishonorable
 
00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.309 align:start position:0%
general discharges under dishonorable
conditions

00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
could you give me examples of why
 
00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.910 align:start position:0%
could you give me examples of why
somebody

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
would get a general discharge under
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
honorable conditions
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
but not get a honorable discharge
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
so general honor honorable thank you for
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
the question by the way general honor
 
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.710 align:start position:0%
the question by the way general honor
honorable

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
honorable
 
00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.430 align:start position:0%
honorable
is

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
a vehicle by which commanding officers
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
through the non-judicial punishment
 
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.390 align:start position:0%
through the non-judicial punishment
system

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.510 align:start position:0%
system
can

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
have individuals separated from the
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
military and it's usually for con for
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
things that for the individual did not
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
meet standards so somebody who is for
 
00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.069 align:start position:0%
meet standards so somebody who is for
example

00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
not meeting weight standards um would
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
not has not committed a crime
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
they're not violating any laws
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh they would not get a bad conduct
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
nor dishonorable or other than honorable
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
discharge but they will be released
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
general under honorable conditions so
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
general discharge but they served
 
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.630 align:start position:0%
general discharge but they served
honorably

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
honorably
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
they just did not meet the standards for
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
um representative plea
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
my my question is um
 
00:49:24.559 --> 00:49:25.750 align:start position:0%
my my question is um
that

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
my aunt back in the day
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
um was she had to leave service because
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
she um became pregnant and back then you
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
got a general discharge
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
um i don't even believe they did
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
honorable or it was just a general
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
discharge in time since i think they've
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
changed it over i think she got changed
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
over to an honorable district so someone
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
such as herself would then qualify for
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
the benefits as long as she had time and
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
service that is correct thank you so
 
00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.270 align:start position:0%
service that is correct thank you so
much

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.270 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i don't know
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
to whom this question should be directed
 
00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.069 align:start position:0%
to whom this question should be directed
um

00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
but i'm wondering
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
given the potential impact this bill
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
might have why there is no financial
 
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.910 align:start position:0%
might have why there is no financial
note

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i'll make note of
 
00:50:18.079 --> 00:50:18.870 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i'll make note of
that

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
i can get back to you
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
to call now
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman ladies and
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
gentlemen the committee
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is kevin grady
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
i'm a 25-year
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
veteran of our air force and i'm a
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
23-year veteran of the town of hooksett
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
lived here that long
 
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
today i'm here representing the state
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
veterans advisory committee and this is
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
my first chance to talk to you this
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
session so i thought what i would do is
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
take just about 30 seconds in tour to
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
tell you what it is we do and how we do
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
it we're actually chartered by state rsa
 
00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.390 align:start position:0%
it we're actually chartered by state rsa
115

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
115
 
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.270 align:start position:0%
115
dash

00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
dash
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
a colon 8
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
with up to 20 member organizations which
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
we have right now and these are
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
organizations that would be familiar to
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
you like the veterans of foreign war the
 
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
american legion those folks
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we do we meet on
 
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
a monthly basis
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
and one of the things we do is we look
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
over the bills that are coming before
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature that have better impact
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
and we
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
vote and take a position and then we i
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
come and tell you what that position is
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
we support a wholeheartedly this
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
legislation um and for a couple of
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
reasons the first is that it
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
it kind of aligns things with what the
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
federal government's doing and i know
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
that that sometimes can be an unpopular
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know decision
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
around here politically but from the
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
military perspective whenever we can do
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
things like the the active military is
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
doing it it's better for us the national
 
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
guard for example there's a reason that
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
those folks go to active duty training
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
okay then there's not specific guard
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
training for to be a soldier or an
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
airman in our in our national guard they
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
go when they train alongside the active
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
duty folks because there's a chance that
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
at some point title 10 of u.s law is
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
going to kick in and they're going to be
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
called to active duty to help support
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
things our tanker folks over at pease
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
are doing this every single day so the
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
more we can sort of look like that the
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
better um the last thing i want to leave
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
you with is
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
i think a general discharge kind of gets
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
a bad rap
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
and as a former commander in the
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
military i can tell you as mr gadreau
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
did that
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes that's used for somebody who's
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
really doing a good job but just not
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
meeting the standards the weight
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
standard is an exceptionally good
 
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
example let me give you just a couple
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
more um
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
i wearing one of my other hats i'm an
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
air force academy admissions liaison
 
00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.030 align:start position:0%
air force academy admissions liaison
officer

00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
officer
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
and six years ago i put a young lady
 
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
into the air force academy and while she
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
was there in her junior year she
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
suffered a back injury
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
and she had to have that same surgery
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
tiger woods had you know where they fuse
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
your spine together and the department
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
of defense military evaluation review
 
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
board folks said hey we love you but
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
we're sorry you can't serve anymore so
 
00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
she got a general discharge
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
from the military at that point now the
 
00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.069 align:start position:0%
from the military at that point now the
va

00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
va
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
judging from the state from the national
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
level down the va is on the hook for
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
her medical stuff if that condition
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
deteriorates the va is on the hook to
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
pay for that for the rest of her life
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
but she doesn't qualify for anything at
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
the state level because it's a general
 
00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
discharge okay and this is the person
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
who is so sharp if she wanted to be in
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
our state government she ought to have a
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
veteran preference to be in our state
 
00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.270 align:start position:0%
veteran preference to be in our state
government

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
the last thing i'll leave you with is
 
00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:49.910 align:start position:0%
the last thing i'll leave you with is
that

00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
every year the services send people to
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
basic training that for whatever reason
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
it's just not a match made in heaven
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
we call this failure to adapt to
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
military service it's not their fault
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily they just picked a bad
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
situation and that person shouldn't
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily be penalized for the rest of
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
their life because that is a general
 
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
discharge as opposed to an honorable
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
discharge so
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
i'll conclude by just saying we do
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
support this legislation and um
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
available if anybody has any questions
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much is there any
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
questions to this
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.430 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.870 align:start position:0%
question
uh

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
you kind of
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
got my peak my interest when you said
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
that uh if people were in boot camp and
 
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
they uh didn't quite fit in that they
 
00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:40.950 align:start position:0%
they uh didn't quite fit in that they
would

00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
get a uh general discharge is that
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
correct yes sir typically
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh follow up
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
one follow-up uh well in my preparation
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
for this hearing
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
i uh went
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
and looked to find out what kinds of
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
service discharges you can get
 
00:54:58.640 --> 00:54:59.829 align:start position:0%
service discharges you can get
uh

00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:59.839 --> 00:55:01.190 align:start position:0%
uh
and

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.390 align:start position:0%
and
the

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
there's obviously the honorable
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
discharge general other than honorable
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
why would
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
someone that failed to accommodate or
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
adapt to
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
the military get a
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
general discharge instead of an
 
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
entry-level discharge well it's it
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
out of basic training it might be that
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
but if they subsequently went to
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
follow-on training and washed out of
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
that and some of those trainings are up
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
to a year long then they then they
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
because they had served for longer the
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
the the service is not necessarily
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
characterized as um
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
it's characterized as honorable service
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
but not for long enough that people
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
would typically give someone an
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
honorable discharge and therefore they
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
probably would get the general
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr kid thank you for taking my
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
question how would this impact a lot of
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
youngsters from high school
 
00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.630 align:start position:0%
youngsters from high school
um

00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
register or go
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
armed services right for training and
 
00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:04.309 align:start position:0%
armed services right for training and
stuff

00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
and if they are general discharge
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
they should be able to qualify for
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
educational through this bill
 
00:56:14.079 --> 00:56:14.870 align:start position:0%
educational through this bill
well

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of the educational benefits that
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
you're talking about representative are
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
are federal uh
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay federal level and and they would
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
still qualify for those um now if they
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
were if
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
if it was out of the national guard or
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
something like that and they were
 
00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
discharging their general purposes and
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
they they probably wouldn't qualify for
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
the guard benefits either
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up one question yeah
 
00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.309 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up one question yeah
so

00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
the next one would be if somebody served
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
like you said
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
and didn't quite
 
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh meet the standards for the services
 
00:56:50.789 --> 00:56:50.799 align:start position:0%
but they served for a year or two
 
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
so they will qualify for the medical
 
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
under these if they're general discharge
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
if they had a medical condition that was
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
part of the reason that they were
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
discharged yes they would
 
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:07.109 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
representatives

00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
sorry but thank you for
 
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
kind of a two-part question
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
general discharge under honorable
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
conditions does qualify for gi bill
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
benefits federally
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
i think those are excluded i'm sorry i
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
didn't hear your question um it wasn't a
 
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
question but here is my question can you
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
define for me
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
what it means
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
to serve
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
and i realize that's kind of an
 
00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
open-ended question but in the examples
 
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
that you you gave about
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
failure to adapt to them to the
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
is that considered service
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
even if you go through the program and
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
the program's not for you
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
what how do you define service i i would
 
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
think that service is kind of in the eye
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
of the beholder
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
in that case it's it's it's pretty much
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
in the eye of somebody that you want to
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
to work for or whatever if you went and
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
tried to be in the military and you met
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
all of the entrance requirements to get
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
into the military and then you
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
you found out it wasn't for you at some
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
point on this profile and it might not
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
it might not be might be partly way
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
through training it might be in their
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%
follow-on training it might be in the
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
first year or two
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
of of service but i think that that
 
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
anybody that tries honorable or tries to
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
serve with good intentions to serve in
 
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
our military uh would deserve some
 
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
consideration as to
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
as to
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
their intentions and you know and and
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
and how they carried that out
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
very helpful thank you are there any
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
other questions to this witness

and i'd like to call now i would like to
 
00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
call miss
 
00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
is that better uh good morning my name
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
is jim miesha i'm the chief assessor for
 
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
the town of hudson new hampshire and i
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
am here uh neutral on this bill um but
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
when i uh read these bills i ask myself
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
what could be the impact of these bills
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh i'm also a resident of town of
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
hooksett for 25 plus years
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
i researched online and there was a 2015
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
report from the office of the secretary
 
00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
of defense that discharges from the
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
2014-2015 fiscal year
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
under honorable condition general and
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
honorable conditions
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
6.36 percent
 
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
of those discharges in that year that's
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
all i could find
 
00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.630 align:start position:0%
all i could find
so

00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
um if if
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
we apply that to new hampshire
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
according to new hampshire department of
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
military affairs and veterans services
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
2019 is a document on town of hudson
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
website there are 9 99 249 veterans in
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:00:14.559 --> 01:00:15.270 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
so

01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
if you infer that 6.36 of them are under
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
honorable conditions
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
you could come up with 6 312 veterans
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
who are under that
 
01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
but how many owned homes
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
according to the urban institute study
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
in 2017
 
01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
78 percent of veteran households are
 
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.990 align:start position:0%
78 percent of veteran households are
homeowners

01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
that's the most recent i could find if
 
01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.349 align:start position:0%
that's the most recent i could find if
78

01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
78
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
were homeowners that could mean there's
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
4923 more veterans
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
tax credits that might be able to be
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
granted assuming all eligible applied
 
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
and were otherwise eligible
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
according to the dra in 2020 out of all
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
the veterans tax credits that are given
 
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
there was about 54 654 credits
 
01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:10.789 align:start position:0%
there was about 54 654 credits
so

01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
if if this were to pass
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
then more ventures would be getting tax
 
01:01:14.559 --> 01:01:16.069 align:start position:0%
then more ventures would be getting tax
credits

01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
credits
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's unclear if rsa 72
 
01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.670 align:start position:0%
it's unclear if rsa 72
27

01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
27
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
dash a 4 comes in play or not
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
72 colon 27-a says
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
basically changes to exemption or credit
 
01:01:31.839 --> 01:01:33.030 align:start position:0%
basically changes to exemption or credit
amounts

01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
amounts
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
only become
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
effective in a community if the
 
01:01:35.839 --> 01:01:36.829 align:start position:0%
effective in a community if the
community

01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
re-adopts their tax credits
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
unless otherwise expressly required in
 
01:01:42.079 --> 01:01:43.750 align:start position:0%
unless otherwise expressly required in
law

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
so the question is
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
does this bill universally change it
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
for every community are the voters voted
 
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
on a certain way does this universally
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
change what the voters voted on or would
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
this have to it would only be
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
able to be implemented on a community
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
community basis if they vote to
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
re-adopt their veterans tax credits
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
and that's all i have
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
i see none thank you very much for your
 
01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you and i'm going to
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
close the hearing
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
support for
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
opposed three
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
and the sign-in sheets
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
on 1374 we had no sign-ins on the blue
 
01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.670 align:start position:0%
on 1374 we had no sign-ins on the blue
sheet

01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
on 1375 we had
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
mr control mr michael and mr perry
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh all support
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
veteran services
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
he also supports that
 
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
did you guys get that
 
01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.349 align:start position:0%
did you guys get that
yes

01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to open the hearing on
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 1056. it's relative to
 
01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
mr chase representative how are you
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
today i'm great how are you mr chairman
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you to the committee for
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
letting me introduce house bill 1056 and
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
act relative to
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
the veterans tax credits so this bill
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
increases the amount of the veterans
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
property tax credits and removes the
 
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
requirement that a veteran has at least
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
90 days of active duty service this
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
latter part is supported by the state
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
veterans advisory council
 
01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
first i'll touch upon the reasoning for
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
increasing the minimum veterans property
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
tax credit and increasing the optional
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
veterans property tax credit range the
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
reason for increasing the minimum is to
 
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
create more equity for veterans across
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire the current fifty dollar
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
minimum is probably offered in about
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
looking at the dra's website forty to
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
fifty communities most of them
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
uninhabited which is woefully low as
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
with the other bills i've brought before
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
this committee fifty dollars today is
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
not worth the same as fifty dollars two
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
decades ago yogi berra also said it well
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
and nicole ain't worth a dime anymore uh
 
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
200 minimum would be much better and
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
more just for all veterans most
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
communities have a 500
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
tax credit which uh that they've chosen
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
to adopt through the optional tax credit
 
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
um rsa and the
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
and which was former the maximum amount
 
01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
before 2018 uh the optional veterans tax
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
credit for communities rather than some
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
veterans getting fifty dollars in the
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
majority getting 500
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
all would get at least 200 and most will
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
receive 500 so rather than some getting
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
a thousand percent less than the
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
majority of veterans in this state
 
01:05:17.599 --> 01:05:19.029 align:start position:0%
majority of veterans in this state
most

01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
will get you know the 500 and that small
 
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
minority will only get 150 percent less
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh the reason for increasing the
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
optional veterans tax credit range of uh
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
up to uh from 201 dollars to 900 is
 
01:05:35.829 --> 01:05:35.839 align:start position:0%
twofold first a new minimum dollars a
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
minimum tax credit would require the
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
lower of the range of the optional
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credit to increase two
 
01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
hundred one dollars second seeing that
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
we would increase the bond with the
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
range by 150 dollars i thought it would
 
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
be fair and logical to increase the
 
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
upper of the range by 150 to 900
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
overall this will not affect anyone
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
unless communities adopt an optional
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credit credit higher than
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
what they're currently offering to
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
veterans as i mentioned the majority of
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
communities offer the 500 tax credit a
 
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
few taken upon themselves since 2018 to
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
offer the 750 tax credit this 900
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
increase of the upper range is not
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
requiring any community to offer 900 tax
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
credit it's just allowing communities
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
the option to offer up to 900
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
um for the most part no community could
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
ever adopt you know the higher end of
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
this range and most communities will
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
probably stay at the current 500 tax
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
credit um to help mitigate any possible
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
costs i made the legislation go into
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
effect on january 1st 2023 and i gave
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
communities a three-year phase-in uh for
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
potential cost to you know to account
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
for those even though
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
in most communities this would probably
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
have you know
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
probably no tax impact on the majority
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
of taxpayers um so again thank you for
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
letting me speak and i'd be more than
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions from the
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
committee if there are any
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
so as you briefly touched upon in your
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
bill introduction
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
and as we see throughout the framework
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
of this bill that you have struck the
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
language in the requirement for
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
not less than 90 days of service could
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
you please explain your rationale for
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
eliminating that minimum
 
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
days of service to be eligible for the
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credits
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
um so i can give you my reasoning but i
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
think the state veterans advisory
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
council could probably
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
explain more why their support for it is
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
because i think it might be different i
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
found the uh then so in my opinion i
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
didn't think that there should be
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
because uh they have they have to have
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
served in a qualifying in a qualifying
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
armed conflict right qualifying war or
 
01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
armed conflict and was honorably
 
01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
discharged i didn't think that it made
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
sense to have a time limit for how long
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
someone fought in a war for the united
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
states i think if they've been in on the
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
front lines or you know serving in an
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
armed conflict for even you know a week
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
it makes sense for them to also be
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
treated the same as other veterans
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
i couldn't really find you know looking
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
through the past and trying to find you
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
know previous sponsors of the original
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
legislation which was you know so long
 
01:08:05.359 --> 01:08:06.630 align:start position:0%
legislation which was you know so long
ago

01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
what the original reasoning was
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
for having the 90-day duration
 
01:08:11.039 --> 01:08:12.870 align:start position:0%
for having the 90-day duration
requirement

01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
so i thought if i can't find any logical
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
reason for why it should exist then why
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
should exist in state law
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
one follow-up
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding perhaps could be the 90
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
days um
 
01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:29.829 align:start position:0%
days um
references

01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
references
 
01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:30.630 align:start position:0%
references
um

01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
boot camp and training
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
so is do i understand you correctly that
 
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
perhaps what you're you're advocating is
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
somebody who washed out of boot camp
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for whatever reason and
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
say they were there for one day they
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
should also be eligible i i think the
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
language and um from on line 10 in
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
section under part 4 section
 
01:08:53.759 --> 01:08:54.550 align:start position:0%
section under part 4 section
a

01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
it says on active service in the armed
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
forces of the united states in any
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
qualifying war or armed conflict i mean
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm misreading maybe i
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
misinterpret it but it says in any
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
qualifying war armed conflict listed in
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
the section and was honorably discharged
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
or an officer honorably separated from
 
01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:13.829 align:start position:0%
or an officer honorably separated from
service

01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
i think in any qualify i think it
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
implies that they have to have fought in
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
that armed conflict or in that war maybe
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
i'm mistaken though and again that could
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
be a good question for the state
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
veterans advisory council to clarify
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
because they they know a lot more about
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
how veterans are specifically affected
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
by this than myself
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
but thank you for the
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
questions yeah just one more question
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
again for the chair
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
um i also think that it could have been
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
pretty easy to put together a financial
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
note for this bill as well
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
and wondering why we don't have one
 
01:09:47.279 --> 01:09:48.709 align:start position:0%
and wondering why we don't have one
okay

01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:09:48.719 --> 01:09:53.269 align:start position:0%
okay
notice

01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any questions
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
i was just checking the rsa numbers
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
that this bill and
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
the previous bill
 
01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.390 align:start position:0%
the previous bill
um

01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.430 align:start position:0%
um
touch

01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
touch
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
both both of them seem to mention rsa
 
01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.590 align:start position:0%
both both of them seem to mention rsa
uh

01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.030 align:start position:0%
uh
72

01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
72
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh 28 at some point or another
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
it mentions honorable discharging um in
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
the previous one so i'm wondering
 
01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:32.790 align:start position:0%
the previous one so i'm wondering
um

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
do you do you think it's necessary to
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
do any sort of amendment work to
 
01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.149 align:start position:0%
do any sort of amendment work to
harmonize

01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
harmonize
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
the two bills here um
 
01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.430 align:start position:0%
the two bills here um
to

01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.709 align:start position:0%
to
maybe

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
um bring the definition of veteran
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
um in accordance with the other one or
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
can they both be
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative and i'm kind of confused
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
what you're so you're asking about
 
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
72 colon 28 on the definition of a
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
veteran if we need to update that
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
in order to be in accordance with this
 
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.790 align:start position:0%
in order to be in accordance with this
legislation

01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
because i mean i think this legislation
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
is just citing 72
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
i don't even know if that's where the
 
01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
definition of a veteran is but
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
i think if you qualify as a veteran
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
under what the state statute says as a
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
veteran then you qualify for this
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credit right if you fought
 
01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:31.830 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credit right if you fought
in

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
any qualifying war armed conflict which
 
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
is also defined in state statute i can
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
remember the exact um rsa and so
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
without you know this is just removing
 
01:11:42.149 --> 01:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
the duration requirements so if you
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
fought even a day in any kind of
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
qualifying war armed conflict that's
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
listed in state statute you would
 
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
my question representative um so
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
if i understand are you trying to
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
equalize or create opportunity for the
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
veterans to get the tax credit across
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
the state because right now it's
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
community to community varies from city
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
to town what the tax credit for uh
 
01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.550 align:start position:0%
to town what the tax credit for uh
housing

01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
every community already has they're
 
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
required under state statute to have the
 
01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.510 align:start position:0%
required under state statute to have the
50

01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
50
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
minimum veterans tax credit
 
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
right that 50 hasn't been updated for
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
you know probably well over a decade the
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
goal of this legislation is not only to
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
increase it because you know inflation
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
is you know does a toll on people's
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
pocket books and on their standard of
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
living but also by increasing it it
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
would make it so then the veterans tax
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
credit is more even across the state as
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
i mentioned right so the majority of
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
communities offer you know that offer
 
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
the optional veterans tax credit which
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
is the majority of communities in the
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
state they offer typically about a 500
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
tax credit you can go look on the dras
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
2020 report
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
now there's a small number of
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
communities that some of them are
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
inhabited and some of them haven't
 
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
addressed the you know adoption of the
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
optional veterans tax credit that offer
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
a 50 tax credit so some veterans are
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
getting a thousand percent more of a
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credit than others despite
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
serving in the same conflicts the goal
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
of this is to make it so then it's a
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
little bit more equal right everyone in
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
every community will get at least two
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
but most veterans that are living in the
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
communities with a 500 optional tax
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
credit they'll still get that right and
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation doesn't change the
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
optional tax credit for any communities
 
01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
if you've already adopted an optional
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
tax credit that amount is the amount
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
that will stay unless your community
 
01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
votes to adopt a higher amount or even
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
theoretically a lower amount which i
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
would hope no community does that but
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
theoretically they
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
could one follow-up
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
yeah so would you believe or do you
 
01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:51.750 align:start position:0%
yeah so would you believe or do you
anticipate

01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
this would address the housing shortage
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
and not
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
moving the
 
01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
mobility of the veterans where going to
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
housing credit
 
01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:06.950 align:start position:0%
housing credit
versus

01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
you know kind of evenly distributing
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
have you looked at that i haven't
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at that i mean i assume
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
this would
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
maybe some veterans you know that
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
consider the tax credit when they're
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
looking to buy a home that they would
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
consider that but for the most part i
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
was just thinking about in a way that
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
you know these veterans serve their
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
country and that they deserve to retire
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
in dignity in a home that they've
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
invested their their equity into right
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
their time and when they've come back
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
from you know from an armed conflict or
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
a qualifying war it's defined by the
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
state that you know it should be a
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more equal there shouldn't be
 
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
some veterans that serve in the same
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
conflict getting 50 and others getting
 
01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.149 align:start position:0%
conflict getting 50 and others getting
500

01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
500
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
i feel as if you know it's more fair to
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
have everyone at least getting 200
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
even if the majority get 50 and also
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
increase that range so communities that
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
so choose to that have the tax base to
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
do it can increase the uh the um the
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credit i think with the
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
inflationary period that we're going
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
through right now with the increase of
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
cost of living and housing in the state
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
and throughout the northeast i think it
 
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
makes sense for communities if they want
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
to to be able to offer a higher tax
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
credit up to 900 and i also think it's
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
good for the workforce veterans tend to
 
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
be very dependable workers uh they're
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know new hampshire has a very large
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
percentage of veterans population and we
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
had a bill in front of my committee
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
state federal relations and veterans
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
affairs that you know actually a couple
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
of them that's going to be working more
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
to bring veterans to the state i think
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
this could be one way to bring more
 
01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
veterans to this state or at least
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
veterans who are looking to retire which
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
retiring and buying a home is also
 
01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
investing in a community so
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh the previous hearing
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
towns needing to re-adapt
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
the tax credit
 
01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.550 align:start position:0%
the tax credit
is

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative could you define re-adapt
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
like do you mean
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.350 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:10.630 align:start position:0%
uh
no

01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:12.149 align:start position:0%
no
since

01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
since uh
 
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
you're changing the amounts
 
01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
does that mean that the
 
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
for the previous adapt adoption
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
is no longer valid
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
i i don't think so not the way the rsa
 
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
reads it just allows if a community
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
wants to adopt a different amount they
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
can go to the ballot and adopt a
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
different amount whenever they want um
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
how i would imagine it working is
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
currently it's fifty dollar minimum any
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
community that has a fifty dollar
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
minimum this would increase their
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
minimum to two hundred dollars that
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
would be required by state statute but
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
any community that currently has adopted
 
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
the optional tax credit it wouldn't
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
change it unless they weren't unless the
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
current tax credit they had adopted
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't was um
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
was outside was lower than that 200
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
amount right that 201 dollars so let's
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
say a community theoretically had a 150
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
tax credit currently adopted right i
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
would assume they would automatically
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
now be the 200 minimum they would have
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
to maybe re-adopt more than 200 or they
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
could just choose to deal with that 200
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
minimum i think when i look there's only
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
about two towns
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
that offer less than a 200
 
01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.750 align:start position:0%
that offer less than a 200
um

01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
optional tax credit so i mean there
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
might be two or three towns in the state
 
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
that might have to decide whether or not
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
you know they want to adopt a higher
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
amount or if they're just going to deal
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
with the maybe 50 or 25 dollar increase
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:40.250 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:42.390 align:start position:0%

i'm a selectman in hampstead
and

01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
like all towns we get upset when
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
the state mandates
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
as anything
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
that word shall is really you know
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's a dirty word
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's a four-letter word to us
 
01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.470 align:start position:0%
it's a four-letter word to us
so

01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh do you uh recognize the fact that
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
when you increase even in 500 to the 900
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
which is still which is optional the
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
amount of pressure
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
local communities will feel
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
from their veterans
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
in their community
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
to raise it to 900. so aren't you really
 
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
mandating the 900
 
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
tax credit because of the way
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's handled in most communities
 
01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:31.669 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's handled in most communities
um

01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie i would look at
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
the um the historical example of 2018 in
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
passing increasing from 500 to the 750
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
amount not a lot of communities have
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
gone to adopt it and for the majority of
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
the time it might be petition warrant
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
that does it um it's more of just a
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
democratic process if there's a group of
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
residents in the community who are
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
voters qualified voters or if a border
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
selector decides to put onto the ballot
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
you know any kind of increase or
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
decrease of the uh of the veterans
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
optional tax credit it's up to the
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
voters to make that final decision if
 
01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
they're willing to bear any of that
 
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
burden now for the most part i'm going
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
to address it more in my second
 
01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.229 align:start position:0%
to address it more in my second
testimony

01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
the amount that the amount of veterans
 
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
in each community as a percentage of the
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
of the taxpaying population is so small
 
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
right and the amount of revenue lost is
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
so minute the majority of communities
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
the vast majority will not see any kind
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
of burden shifting
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
that you might expect so i i'm not sure
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
if um
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if the concern that this
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
would automatically you know create some
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
kind of revenue losses would be large
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
enough for any community not to be able
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
to deal with especially with the
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
three-year phased-in approach and i also
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
think because it's ultimately the
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who vote to adopt or not to
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
adopt these tax credits i think they
 
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
have the final say and even via if they
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
want to you know put in a petition
 
01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:54.149 align:start position:0%
want to you know put in a petition
warrant

01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer thank you mr
 
01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:14.390 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer thank you mr
chair

01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much um
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
i i have gone over the the
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
dra um information and so on and
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
and um my my question to you is that
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
have you noticed that those that would
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
be affected by this are smaller towns
 
01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.709 align:start position:0%
be affected by this are smaller towns
and

01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:38.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
a smaller town does have a significant
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
impact and
 
01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
i look at 50 150
 
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
type of things and um for instance the
 
01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.030 align:start position:0%
type of things and um for instance the
berlin

01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
berlin
 
01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
berlin has 356 veterans now getting it
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
at 150 and i know that's only an
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
increase of 50 dollars per but this does
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
have an effect on them a place like
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
hart's location and i will get to my
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
question yes
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
a place like hart's location has four
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
people and they're getting 50 you're
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
you're asking them to go up and it's a
 
01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
small community
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
have you have you talked to any of those
 
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
those towns and so on within that area
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
to find out how they would be able to
 
01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
handle this because we all know that
 
01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
when we give a credit we push the burden
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
on to somebody else which could be young
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
family and i worked 26 years for the
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
department of veterans affairs and i
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
chaired your committee at one point so
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
i'm all for helping veterans in every
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
way shape and form i'm just afraid of
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
this shell what it will do and so my
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
question to you is have you checked with
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
those any of those communities that are
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
impacted by it um i have not and thank
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
you for your question i have not
 
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
um i think i think the bigger thing to
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
remember is um the majority of the
 
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
communities that have the fifty dollars
 
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
right now are uninhabited right so if
 
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
you look at the dra a lot of those
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
communities are uninhabited there is a
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
very small amount that do i think you
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
also have to remember the percentage of
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
veterans that live in that community
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
because that's really what's going to be
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
able to determine um how much that shift
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
is and for the most part most
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
communities in new hampshire except for
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know some very small ones like you
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned hearts location right they
 
01:22:12.149 --> 01:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
obviously have a disproportionate amount
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
of veterans you mentioned the four
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
veterans um and i believe hearts
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
location only has about 20 people that
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
live there 26 people i believe if i
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
remember off the top my head their
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
budgets actually ran i believed by
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
carroll county's commissioners if i'm
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
not mistaken
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
so i could speak to our commissioners
 
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
about that specific issue but for the
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
most part i mean that's a 200 shift for
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
their entire budget that the county
 
01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:35.510 align:start position:0%
their entire budget that the county
helps

01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
helps
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
operate so i still think the amount is
 
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
quite small i still think the percentage
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
of the veterans in these communities is
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
such a small percentage that the overall
 
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
shift when i did the math would um
 
01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
there'd only be a handful of communities
 
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
where it would actually see any kind of
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
even impact on someone's property tax
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
bill for the most part
 
01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:57.110 align:start position:0%
bill for the most part
so

01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for
 
01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:01.910 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for
representatives

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
okay i see
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
i would like to call jim mishad back up
 
01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:29.510 align:start position:0%
i would like to call jim mishad back up
again

01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
good morning committee members uh jim
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
michaud chief assessor for the town of
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
hudson and i am neutral on this bill
 
01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.390 align:start position:0%
hudson and i am neutral on this bill
um

01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of research according
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
to online dra data for 2020 there are 48
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
communities whose residents have decided
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
to have their standard veterans tax
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
credits below 200
 
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
including and i was kind of shocked at
 
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
this including concord
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
i went to the website just to confirm
 
01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:55.270 align:start position:0%
i went to the website just to confirm
that

01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
concord berlin colebrook and it's true
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
many small communities but
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
concord's not small
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
of the communities that are at the
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
current maximum of 750
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
admittedly there's only been a few
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
cycles a few years since that went into
 
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
play 17 out of the 257 taxing
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions have that upper limit
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's clear or not if
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
this goes into effect
 
01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:24.070 align:start position:0%
this goes into effect
that

01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
communities would automatically take
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
place in those 48 communities or not
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of above my pay grade um
 
01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
do they have to re-adopt it or does it
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
just universally happen
 
01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:37.189 align:start position:0%
just universally happen
um

01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
the language in the bill covers um the
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
all veterans tax credit which is a
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
non-wartime defined tax credit right the
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
all veterans tax credit was created to
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
give an ability for communities to offer
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
a veterans tax credit to those that did
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
not serve during war defined periods
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
and that is the only statute
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
of the veterans tax credits that does
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
have that three-year phase in
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
so the others would not you know if it's
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
mandatory um
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know i guess you could phase in the
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
all veterans but the other ones would be
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
would just happen
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
um and i think the veterans
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
organizations behind me will speak more
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
to 90 day active duty requirement but
 
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
everywhere i look it seems to be a
 
01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:20.709 align:start position:0%
everywhere i look it seems to be a
universal

01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
universal
 
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
minimum number of days of active duty to
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
acquire most of the va benefits
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
they all seem to be 90 days or more
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
but that's that's informal
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
that's not uh that's not my my expertise
 
01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.750 align:start position:0%
that's not uh that's not my my expertise
and

01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
i ask myself how many have served less
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
than 90 days i can't find an answer for
 
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.270 align:start position:0%
than 90 days i can't find an answer for
that

01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
google doesn't tell me duckduckgo
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell me i don't know the answer
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
maybe dod knows but um i don't know if
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
most communities are at 500
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
but the dra does have a list then you
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
can sort it in excel it's downloadable
 
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
and it's very helpful
 
01:25:57.910 --> 01:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony is
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
there any questions for this witness
 
01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:03.910 align:start position:0%
there any questions for this witness
representative

01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
when you introduced yourself um
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
did you say that you're a
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
assessor for hudson that's correct
 
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
all right so so so the automatic
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
increase from fifty dollars to two
 
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars would impact
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh hudson thank you for the question it
 
01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
would not impact hudson hudson is
 
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
currently at uh six hundred dollars uh
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
effective for the first time in 2021 so
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
this would not impact hudson
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
the 90 days
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
lowering it to less than 90 days would
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:26:57.669 --> 01:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
i'd like to now call maura ryan did i
 
01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me my name is maura ryan and i am
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
actually a veteran i usually have a sign
 
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
that says i'm a veteran because most
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
people confuse it and think it's only
 
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
men but that's not true
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
primarily because it impacts many female
 
01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
veterans who need households because
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
they have young children
 
01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:39.669 align:start position:0%
they have young children
um

01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:41.110 --> 01:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
essentially many people are coming out
 
01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
of the military um
 
01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.310 align:start position:0%
of the military um
they

01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
can't always find housing
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
and places like harbor homes are not
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
able to house anyone with young children
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
the veterans tax credit is very
 
01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
important because it affects their
 
01:27:59.110 --> 01:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
ability to maintain housing
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
i know that i purchased my home in 2013
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
i got out of the mill i retired i was
 
01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
retired from the military in 2018.
 
01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
um in the
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
eight years i've had my home
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
my home has been reassessed six times
 
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
the most recent assessment in 2021 with
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
a 1200 increase
 
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
as a medically retired veteran that
 
01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
impacts me because my cola is generally
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
only one percent which doesn't cover the
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
increase in my taxes
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
there are a number of veterans who
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to come and speak out on this
 
01:28:29.679 --> 01:28:31.030 align:start position:0%
wanted to come and speak out on this
because

01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
we're really not in alignment with the
 
01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
inflation inflation that's going on
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
and there are many people who are trying
 
01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
to maintain their homes
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
vested members of their community many
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
of them do
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
community service many of them do a lot
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
of community service at the va hospital
 
01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:55.350 align:start position:0%
of community service at the va hospital
and

01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:56.470 --> 01:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
essentially i feel that they're
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
deserving of the increase in the tax
 
01:28:58.239 --> 01:29:00.149 align:start position:0%
deserving of the increase in the tax
credit

01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
credit
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%

01:29:13.110 --> 01:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
ryan
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for your
 
01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:24.639 align:start position:0%
service and thank you for testifying
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
and you bring out a good point in terms
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
of the female veterans because when you
 
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
think of veterans the image is usually a
 
01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:32.229 align:start position:0%
think of veterans the image is usually a
male

01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
male
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
saying veteran so um and
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
how many do you
 
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
think you have in terms of in new
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire or in your community that are
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
female veterans with young family
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
that would really significantly benefit
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
from this this is just one aspect
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
of your existence right the tax credit
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
for and then other benefits would help
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
to get back on the fee well actually for
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
anyone who comes out of the military um
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
if you are medically discharged you're
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
able to collect va disability but you're
 
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
not able to get your retirement pay
 
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
which is a big negative
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to work on that as well
 
01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:16.629 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to work on that as well
but

01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
many of the female veterans the female
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
veteran population is increasing it's
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
roughly at 10 percent growing very
 
01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:23.430 align:start position:0%
roughly at 10 percent growing very
quickly

01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
many of them are single parents with
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
children as well
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
and there's something called an
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
apportionment i testified last year on
 
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
the apportionment claim that's how we
 
01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:32.149 align:start position:0%
the apportionment claim that's how we
get

01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
our child support i've been fighting my
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
apportionment case for 12 years so my
 
01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
son who's about to turn 18 i've been
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
trying to get child support for him for
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
over 12 years so the main thing i rely
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
on is the va disability i'm not entitled
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
to retirement pay and i do have to pay
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
for my son's health insurance through
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
of defense
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
and i did ask at my town just to answer
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
your question appropriately i did ask at
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
my town regarding the number of veteran
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
households they could definitively
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
identify 35 veteran households our
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
town is over 10 000 households
 
01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
and just to follow up with that 35 or
 
01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:12.470 align:start position:0%
and just to follow up with that 35 or

01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
female yes okay thank you

there are some single uh
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and i hope you
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
i'm going to close the hearing on
 
01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
10 56
 
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
and open the hearing at 10 30 which is
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
representative de chase
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
you want to introduce the bill
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman thank you to
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
the thank you to the committee i think
 
01:32:32.310 --> 01:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
this is gonna be the last time you guys
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
see me for uh for the year hopefully
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
unless i'm mistaken i have to fill in
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
for someone else for a bill that i'm
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
co-sponsoring but this is the uh this is
 
01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
the third
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation i have in front of
 
01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
you that regards property tax exemption
 
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
or property tax credits um but this
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
one's the largest of the three that
 
01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
would have probably the greatest fiscal
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
impact locally which is um relative to
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
the tax exemption for the elderly
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
so this bill would increase income
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria for the elderly
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
property tax exemption it lowers the
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility age by about five years and
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
changes the um the three tiers for the
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
eligibility and permits municipalities
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
to phase in the revised eligibility
 
01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
criteria over a three-year period it
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
also decreases the duration requirement
 
01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
from three years to one year much of the
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
reasoning for this legislation is the
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
same as house bill 1055 which i believe
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
i spoke about a week or two ago
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
introduced to the committee the
 
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
legislation relative to the property tax
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
exemption for individuals with
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
disabilities and individuals who are
 
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
deaf or severely hearing impaired and
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment to adjust the
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
income asset qualifications for the
 
01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
blind property tax exemption the
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
adjustment for income and asset
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria for the property
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
tax exemption outlined in house bill
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
1057 is based upon
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
the inflation rate from 2008 to 2021
 
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
2008 was chosen as a beginning year
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
because the rsa was last changed in 2008
 
01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
i chose 2021 because that's when i wrote
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
the bill last year
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
the age qualifications would be updated
 
01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
to three categories people um six years
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
of age up to seven years of age seven
 
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
years of age up to 80 years of age and
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
80 years of age or older the reason for
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
updating the age requirement is to allow
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
more people to qualify and to allow them
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
to qualify sooner this can help many
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire's elderly
 
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
communities save their last few years of
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
income and better plan for their
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
impending retirement and how they're
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
going to be able to stretch their dollar
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
farther people are now living a longer
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
in this country and so a lot of people
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
need to plan not so much for a 15 to 20
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
year retirement but a 30 to 35 year
 
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
retirement uh the duration requirement
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
was lowered from three consecutive years
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
to one year as i mentioned when i
 
01:34:42.629 --> 01:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
testified on house bill 1055 i believe
 
01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
this is almost all
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
i believe someone buying a home in a
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
community and making that long that
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
investment is a long-term commitment
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
when someone invests their time and
 
01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
their resources to move somewhere and to
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
choose to retire hopefully decreasing
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
the duration requirement will
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
incentivize people around the country to
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
retire in new hampshire and make direct
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
investments in their community and grow
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
our property tax base overall
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
choosing to retire in the grand state is
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
also investing in our local communities
 
01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned sorry i read that twice
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
lastly the overall cost of the tax
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
burden shifting will be so minuscule
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
that property taxpayers will either not
 
01:35:18.870 --> 01:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
be affected or not even notice according
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
to hampshire dras 2020 elderly tax
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
exemption report no community has a tax
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
burden shift higher than 4 cents per
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of property evaluation
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
even if communities with the highest
 
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
burden shift saw
 
01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
uh the amount of the tax burdenship
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
double a home of a 300 000 tax
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
evaluation which is the average tax a
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
little bit under the average tax
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
valuation for the highest average county
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
rockingham county
 
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
even if you know a county like
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
rockingham county these communities
 
01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:46.950 align:start position:0%
rockingham county these communities
uh

01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
saw you know a double in this tax burden
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
ship the total increase would only be
 
01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
about twelve dollars per year this is
 
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
fairly large overestimation right we're
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
using the communities with the largest
 
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
burden shipped with the county with the
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
highest property tax evaluation so
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
for the most part most communities will
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
see increases between zero dollars to
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
maybe five six seven dollars per
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
household this trade-off would help
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
thousands of elderly constituents be
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
able to stay and keep their homes rather
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
than having to move into other housing
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
options and for a lot of folks in a lot
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
of communities there aren't other
 
01:36:20.229 --> 01:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
housing options it's either you're in
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
the home that you bought and put equity
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
in for the last 30 or 40 years or you're
 
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
gonna have to ask a family member to
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
start subsidizing your living either in
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in the state or in
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
another part of the country typically it
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
tends to be florida
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
so to help mitigate any possible cost of
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
this tax um of this tax exemption uh
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
like with the other two pieces of
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
legislation made the legislation go into
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
effect on january 1st 2023 and i gave
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
communities three years to phase in any
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
of those potential costs and again thank
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
you for letting me speak and i will
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
remain open to any questions are there
 
01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
any questions for this representative
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
like the others
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
there is no fiscal note to this and i do
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
believe there is a significant fiscal
 
01:37:07.109 --> 01:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
note that would be attached to this but
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
i'm so loaded thank you um i i do have a
 
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
i i'm looking at um i i did speak to our
 
01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:16.790 align:start position:0%
i i'm looking at um i i did speak to our
um

01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:17.510 align:start position:0%
um
our

01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
assessing department and so on about all
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
of these exempt bills and
 
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
um i agree
 
01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
that maybe it doesn't seem like it's a
 
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
big burden but when we add them all
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
together it becomes a burden
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
um are you aware that
 
01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
nashua which is my my my city
 
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
753 currently are getting the exemption
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think it would affect them but
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
by adding the 60 do you have any idea
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
the change between 60 and 65
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
how many people would qualify for that
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
i'm going to assume you it's kind of i i
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
would be able to pull that number out of
 
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
the air but yeah i think i can make a
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
rough guesstimate though assuming that
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know obviously the amount of people
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
who would qualify right obviously
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
there's going to be more people
 
01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.159 align:start position:0%
qualifying for this tax credit that are
 
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
between the age of 60 and 75 than 75 to
 
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
older because you know based on people's
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
average age and how long they live
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to have more
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
younger elderly people that qualify than
 
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
older elderly people right not as many
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
people live to 80 as 60. so i would say
 
01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
probably um you would see a
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
disproportionate maybe increase of
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
of elderly people into the tax credit um
 
01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:31.189 align:start position:0%
of elderly people into the tax credit um
so

01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure exactly what the number is
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
but you are right there would be there
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
would be an increase in number of people
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
qualifying for this tax credit so that's
 
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's an undeniable truth i'm just
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
unsure how much of a revenue loss it's
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
actually going to be for communities or
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
how much of a um of a tax burden shift
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
it will be on to other taxpayers like i
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
said i mean an overestimation of about
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
twelve dollars per household is um
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's very minute especially when
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
you're considering the kind of housing
 
01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
issues that we have the amount of people
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
of their homes being reassessed in a
 
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
number of communities that tend to be
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
very property tax high communities um i
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
think i think it's a worthy trade-off
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
for a number of our communities
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
may have a follow-up mr chair i want to
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much um
 
01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
again i look at the numbers and i look
 
01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:18.310 align:start position:0%
again i look at the numbers and i look
at

01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
nashua's number of three-point
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
over 3.2 million dollars in taxes lost
 
01:39:27.149 --> 01:39:27.159 align:start position:0%
because of the current one manchester
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
2.279 million dollars
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
concord is probably about half of that
 
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:32.950 align:start position:0%
concord is probably about half of that
amount

01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
um adding to this what we do is we push
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
this down to younger folks that we're
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
trying to get in here as well do you not
 
01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
see this as being a negative to
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
getting more younger people into our
 
01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
what we're calling ourselves a gray
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
community a great state
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
i think most younger people rent so they
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say directly in their property
 
01:39:56.709 --> 01:39:56.719 align:start position:0%
tax bill i'm not sure most renters would
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
increase their rent drastically because
 
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
they saw an increase in the amount of
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
property tax taxes they have to pay go
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
up by you know 10 to 12 dollars
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
depending on what kind of home they're
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
renting i mean obviously i think you
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned for example like manchester i
 
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
think their current tax burden shift was
 
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
only about was it two and a half cents
 
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
or was it three cents no maybe it was
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
only two and a half cents per thousand
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
dollars which i mean that's actually one
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
of the lowest tax burden shifts of all
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
this so it tends to actually be the
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
larger cities where this tax burden
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
shift is felt a lot less right
 
01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
manchester and nashville concord at
 
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
least when i look through the dra stuff
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
so um i would be actually more concerned
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
about the tax burden burdenship that may
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
happen in a number of smaller
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
communities but like i said the numbers
 
01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
that i brought in front of the committee
 
01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
today that i explained you know an
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
average property tax sorry an average
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
home evaluation tax valuation of 300 000
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
which is the average in rockingham the
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
state with the highest average and with
 
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
a doubling of the tax burden ship would
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't which wouldn't happen
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
but that's just you know
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
drastic over estimation if we doubled
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
the top property tax shift the average
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
household would only see about a 12
 
01:41:05.189 --> 01:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
shift so i can imagine any community in
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
this state where you would see a shift
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
of over 12 dollars onto someone's total
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
property tax bill and i like i said
 
01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:15.679 align:start position:0%
earlier i think the um the overall um
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
the overall utility of this and
 
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
increasing this with inflation because
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
remember we're just increasing the
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
amount with inflation
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's good it's going to keep a
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
lot of people in their homes can allow
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
people to retire with dignity and it's
 
01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
going to be able to create an overall
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
net good for our communities right where
 
01:41:31.109 --> 01:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
more people are going to need less kind
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
of other subsidies by just not having to
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
be taxed as much
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
my question pertains to line three
 
01:41:49.590 --> 01:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
of the build text
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
and you have reduced the
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
the residency requirement from three
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
consecutive years to just one year could
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
you please explain and expound upon your
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
rationale for lowering of the residency
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
requirement thank you yeah so as i
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned my testimony today and in my
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
testimony well first thank you for your
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
question representative power and as i
 
01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned my testimony today in my
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
testimony on house bill 1055 i feel as
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
if someone who's either already owning a
 
01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
home here and making an investment in
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
their community and choosing to stay and
 
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
retire in new hampshire or someone who's
 
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
moved to new hampshire who meets the
 
01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
income eligibility requirements who has
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
kind of made that investment in their
 
01:42:30.149 --> 01:42:30.159 align:start position:0%
community in a home
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
i find the three-year period to be in
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
and of itself fairly arbitrary
 
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
i felt as if a one-year period would
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
better reflect you know if someone's
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
going to stay and decide their primary
 
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
residency is in new hampshire you know
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
typically them proving it and staying
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
here an entire year i would find to be
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
um enough but i could be maybe i'm
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
mistaken if someone else has um any
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
other information for how this could
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
create some kind of conflict or make it
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
harder to be able to apply the property
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
tax exemption
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
taking my follow-up question
 
01:43:02.239 --> 01:43:03.350 align:start position:0%
taking my follow-up question
um

01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
so there is a dra report in which it
 
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
states that
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
residency requirements
 
01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:11.669 align:start position:0%
residency requirements
are

01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:43:13.990 --> 01:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
within our new hampshire statute are
 
01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
from three or five years so that's the
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
data that's the norm
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
and so i'd like to understand
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
you have explained why you
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
um feel that reducing the residency to
 
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
requirement you know to one year is
 
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
something that you see fit do you have
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
any um research
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
or outside
 
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
data or inputs that support
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh you are changing it from the three
 
01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
years to the one year thank you thank
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
you for your question uh representative
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
power and so um obviously most of our
 
01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
property tax exemptions for example the
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
elderly tax sorry
 
01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
the disability tax exemption that i
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
brought before the committee the
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
duration requirement was five years for
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
this one it's three years um
 
01:44:04.709 --> 01:44:04.719 align:start position:0%
i have no specific data for why it's
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
currently three to five years i couldn't
 
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
find on the dras website why that's
 
01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:10.719 align:start position:0%
currently in state statute and that's
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why i brought forward
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
these bills was to update the duration
 
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
requirement because i can find
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
any kind of reason now maybe should i
 
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
have done some more due diligence and
 
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
maybe try to reach out to direct people
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
in the dra
 
01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
possibly yeah and i can definitely do
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
that for you if you'd like me to
 
01:44:26.709 --> 01:44:26.719 align:start position:0%
representative power but um i just i
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't find a reason why the three to
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
five year duration requirements were
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
first originally set in stone and state
 
01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:38.629 align:start position:0%
first originally set in stone and state
statute

01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.590 --> 01:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh
 
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
would you believe that the
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
bill seems to be
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
a two issue at least a two if not a
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
three issue
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation why would the
 
01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:00.830 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation why would the
income

01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
changes and the
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:45:04.719 --> 01:45:06.310 align:start position:0%
uh the
age

01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
age
 
01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.669 align:start position:0%
age
requirements

01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
put in one
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
put in one bill where they both seem to
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
be different issues
 
01:45:16.629 --> 01:45:16.639 align:start position:0%
and in my case i have no problem with
 
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
the uh income increases because i i
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
think the
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
cost of living and there's a lot of
 
01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
reasons to make that change but i have a
 
01:45:26.239 --> 01:45:27.030 align:start position:0%
reasons to make that change but i have a
real

01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
real
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:34.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
the question is why did you put both in
 
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
the same bill well uh thank you
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie for your question
 
01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:44.870 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie for your question
um

01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
i guess just a matter of preference
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
instead of creating two bills i thought
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
it'd be better instead of having you
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
guys have to deal with four bills only
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
three bills i had some folks that asked
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
me why don't you put all three of the
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation into one piece of
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and i said well because
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
different you know different property
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
tax credits and exemptions are going to
 
01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
have different
 
01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
impacts on communities and i wanted the
 
01:46:07.109 --> 01:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
community to decide which ones they
 
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
thought were the most pertinent right
 
01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:10.719 align:start position:0%
now which kind of ways that you know
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
what kind of you know the set priority
 
01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
to say you know maybe come back in a few
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
years and try to introduce this one but
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know this one's more realistic i
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
would not be opposed to the committee
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
amending this legislation in any way
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
whether it's changing the eligibility
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
requirements whether it's changing you
 
01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
know the age eligibility and everything
 
01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
if if um you felt it was more than just
 
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
to get rid of uh changing the tier the
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
three tiers you know i wouldn't be
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
opposed i just want to you know i don't
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
let the i don't like the perfect get in
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
the way of the good and if you think
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
that increasing just for inflation the
 
01:46:43.350 --> 01:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
income eligibility and asset eligibility
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
requirement is the best way to go
 
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
forward instead of updating the age um i
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
would not be opposed to that kind of
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
amendment to this representative guthrie
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
i'd be more than happy to work with you
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
to craft it
 
01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that input thank you
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:04.550 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious why you think 60 is
 
01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:12.470 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious why you think 60 is
elderly

01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
elderly
 
01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:13.350 align:start position:0%
elderly
because

01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
i'm under 65 but with your bill i would
 
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
so why was the age 60 so the reason why
 
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
i chose 60 was to give people some time
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to take you know especially
 
01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
folks who might be um
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
a lot more you know wage workers and
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
more working class be able to let them
 
01:47:35.109 --> 01:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
start to save before they go into full
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
retirement right retirement age now is
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
typically especially for a lot of state
 
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
workers it's like 65 to 67 so being able
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
to give people that like five years to
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
be able to start saving and you know the
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
amount of money that they might save
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
from the elderly tax exemption right it
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
might help them be able to starting to
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
stretch their retirement longer because
 
01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
people are living longer too
 
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
so that was kind of my reasoning and
 
01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
like i said i mean with any of the three
 
01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
bills that have brought forward in front
 
01:48:01.590 --> 01:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
of these committee regarding tax
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
exemptions i'm more than willing to work
 
01:48:05.590 --> 01:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
with the committee on amendments to um
 
01:48:07.590 --> 01:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
to make it more favorable to get an
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
ought to pass out of this committee i'm
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
not gonna you know i don't think my
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
bills are by by any means perfect right
 
01:48:14.950 --> 01:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
and that's why they go to the committee
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
for your consideration for you guys to
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
amend and make them better so i'd be
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
more than happy to work on whether it's
 
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
the age whether it's the amounts that
 
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
are in these tax um credits or
 
01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:29.679 align:start position:0%
exemptions or um etc anything i'd be
 
01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
more than willing to craft and work with
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
something i'd even craft it myself if
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
you sent me an email with what exactly
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
your points of contention are and you
 
01:48:38.709 --> 01:48:38.719 align:start position:0%
know i would consider removing them or
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
seeing where we can find some common
 
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.109 align:start position:0%
seeing where we can find some common
ground

01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
ground
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:49.910 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
i may not have
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
stated my question clearly
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
and with all due respect i feel that you
 
01:48:59.350 --> 01:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
did not answer the question so the
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
question that i was asking is did you do
 
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
you have any supporting evidence or and
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
or did you do research that supports
 
01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:09.990 align:start position:0%
or did you do research that supports
your

01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
desire to change the residency
 
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
requirement to one year
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
you answered my question in the inverse
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
i want to know
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
did you do you have any evidence
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
or do research that speak to or support
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
the change to one year thank you okay
 
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative power and thank you for
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh for clarifying and for holding me
 
01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
accountable to that um
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
i have not i don't have any research
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
that i could give you definitively where
 
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
i can show you you know hard numbers of
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
why it should be one year
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
but you know as i previously mentioned
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
is um i couldn't find any evidence for
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
why three to five years was any better
 
01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:50.870 align:start position:0%
why three to five years was any better
either

01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
to me it seems like the duration
 
01:49:54.870 --> 01:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
requirement was subjective it's more of
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
a matter of you know what the committee
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
and what the state finds to be best and
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
maybe you know with the input of local
 
01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
communities what they might find to be
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh easier to um
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
to apply and to uh to be able to handle
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
the burden so um no i have no i have no
 
01:50:10.950 --> 01:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
verifiable evidence for why one year is
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
better than three to five but um
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know i haven't seen any evidence
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
either for why three to five is
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily better than one year either
 
01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:19.270 align:start position:0%
necessarily better than one year either
so

01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
i hope that does that answer your
 
01:50:22.629 --> 01:50:22.639 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
i see a question from representative
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chu thank you
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question my
 
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
question is how did you come up with the
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
income range what was the benchmark or
 
01:50:38.790 --> 01:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
what was the reference
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
you increased
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
from 13
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
13 this low end 13 400 to 17 420
 
01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
and again the high end from
 
01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:53.270 align:start position:0%
and again the high end from
20

01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
400 to 26
 
01:50:55.199 --> 01:50:57.350 align:start position:0%
400 to 26
520

01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
520
 
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
where did you get that
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
benchmark to move it to that yeah so as
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
i as i mentioned
 
01:51:06.629 --> 01:51:06.639 align:start position:0%
in my uh my testimony
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
the adjustment for income and asset
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria for the property
 
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
tax exemption outlined in this
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
legislation is based upon the inflation
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
rate which is the cpi index that i use
 
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
the computer the consumer price index
 
01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
from 2008 when the legislation was last
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
updated to 2001. so this is i mean for
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
all intents and purposes part of the
 
01:51:27.669 --> 01:51:27.679 align:start position:0%
purpose of why i introduced some of
 
01:51:29.589 --> 01:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
these bills to the committee was to make
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
an adjustment for inflation that hasn't
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
been adjusted i would hope maybe moving
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
forward you know in subsequent sessions
 
01:51:38.229 --> 01:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
that we have you know we have um the
 
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
asset and income eligibility be tied to
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
inflation so we don't have to you know
 
01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
go back every few decades and say oh
 
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
look you know the number of people
 
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
qualifying for this is at an all-time
 
01:51:48.629 --> 01:51:48.639 align:start position:0%
low because the legislature hasn't you
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
know kept up the pace with you know the
 
01:51:52.629 --> 01:51:52.639 align:start position:0%
yearly rate of inflation which typically
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
is two and a half percent to now we're
 
01:51:56.790 --> 01:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
seeing as high as seven percent so um
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the it's just making an
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
adjustment so raw i mean i would say
 
01:52:03.189 --> 01:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
we're not really we're not really
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily increasing the eligibility
 
01:52:07.189 --> 01:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
criteria for the property tax exemption
 
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
we're just making it to be in the spirit
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
of the original state statute that was
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
established and that people have fallen
 
01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
out of eligibility because we haven't
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
kept up to keeping with the spirit of
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman yeah so
 
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh if i heard you correctly this wasn't
 
01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:24.950 align:start position:0%
uh if i heard you correctly this wasn't
uh

01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
state uh statute wasn't changed from
 
01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
2008 yeah that when i went through on
 
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
the state's website to look at the last
 
01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
time this rsa was amended it was 2008
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily mean that was
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
the last time the eligibility or the
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
asset requirements were updated but that
 
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
was the last time the law was um
 
01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
that was the last time this rsa was
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
changed and you know that there was a
 
01:52:47.910 --> 01:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that amended the
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
rsa um i could definitely try to reach
 
01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
out to the dra or maybe previous
 
01:52:53.669 --> 01:52:53.679 align:start position:0%
sponsors or maybe even office of
 
01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
legislative solutions might have exactly
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
what that change was in 2008 but um i
 
01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
just chose 2008 as a good number for
 
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's the last time the committee
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
thought it was worthy of updating this
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
rsa so you know it's been about
 
01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
13 years i believe so
 
01:53:10.470 --> 01:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
well now actually 14. so it's been 14
 
01:53:12.229 --> 01:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
years and maybe it's time for us to look
 
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
at this and kind of consider how things
 
01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
change how how new things brought to
 
01:53:18.550 --> 01:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
light make us reinterpret this and how
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
as people's income has been affected by
 
01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:21.990 align:start position:0%
as people's income has been affected by
inflation

01:53:21.990 --> 01:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.870 align:start position:0%
inflation
representatives

01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:53:26.229 --> 01:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
my eye keeps going back to
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh line
 
01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:35.109 align:start position:0%
uh line
three

01:53:35.109 --> 01:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
on page two of the bill
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
and i just i have to ask
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
if we require
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
married couples
 
01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
to have been married to each other for
 
01:53:49.109 --> 01:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
at least five years
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
for their property to qualify for this
 
01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:52.790 align:start position:0%
for their property to qualify for this
exemption

01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
why that wasn't changed in your proposed
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
what is the purpose of being married for
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
five years
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
how does that
 
01:54:07.109 --> 01:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
make you more qualified for the
 
01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
exemption than somebody who maybe got
 
01:54:13.109 --> 01:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
married within the last 90 days
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
well the primary homeowner you know
 
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
would still
 
01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
qualify within the one year
 
01:54:20.050 --> 01:54:20.060 align:start position:0%
right so i guess um
 
01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:21.189 align:start position:0%
right so i guess um
[Music]

01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
i guess so kind of how i looked at it
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
was someone
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
there's sometimes a fear where you know
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
a statue like this could incentivize
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
people to get
 
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
married for legal purposes and not for
 
01:54:36.229 --> 01:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
you know some of the um
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
some of the other you know some people
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
believe that marriage is just something
 
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
that should be a spiritual thing um
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
but so i felt as if making it based upon
 
01:54:46.149 --> 01:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
land ownership might be better rather
 
01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
than the uh the marriage but that's
 
01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
certainly something i'd be more than
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
willing to look at and to entertain an
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
amendment for
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:59.669 --> 01:54:59.679 align:start position:0%
so by that logic then changing it to
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
the residency requirement to one year
 
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
could that not be seen as
 
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
inducing some people to
 
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
move to a town
 
01:55:12.629 --> 01:55:12.639 align:start position:0%
to acquire a property that would have
 
01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
this exemption i agree and that was part
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
of the purpose of this i feel as if
 
01:55:17.589 --> 01:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
someone's going to make an investment in
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
a community that's a good thing overall
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
for the community
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
i mean if they're going to decide to um
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
well first we have to remember the
 
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
people who qualify for this it'd be very
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
tough for them to
 
01:55:29.189 --> 01:55:29.199 align:start position:0%
originally kind of um to buy a home for
 
01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:30.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of the people that qualify for
 
01:55:32.310 --> 01:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
this they're already existing in their
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
home right they and their income has
 
01:55:35.910 --> 01:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
decreased and their assets have
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
decreased because they're getting ready
 
01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
for retirement right so they were
 
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
previously making one amount of money
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
they've now retired and they're living
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
off of pension or their social security
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
so that's um that's one thing but for
 
01:55:46.149 --> 01:55:46.159 align:start position:0%
the number of people that you know in
 
01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
the very rare circumstance where they've
 
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
saved up money and you know have decided
 
01:55:52.229 --> 01:55:52.239 align:start position:0%
that they're going to relocate i think
 
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's good that someone might relocate
 
01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:55.679 align:start position:0%
make an investment in a home spend that
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
money you know have contractors in the
 
01:55:59.830 --> 01:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
area helping them refurbish that home
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
and everything and for them to then you
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
know settle down and to become
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
participating members of the community
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
so the incentive i agree with you i
 
01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
think it's a good incentive personally
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
but maybe i'm mistaken
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you okay are there any other
 
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
 
01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
okay i'd like to wrap it up if anything
 
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
else has been talked about before we
 
01:56:21.669 --> 01:56:21.679 align:start position:0%
want to continue that so go ahead
 
01:56:23.109 --> 01:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question pertains
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
lines fourteen through seventeen where
 
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
you talk about the phase-in period over
 
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
phase-in of this over a three-year
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
period could you briefly just describe
 
01:56:42.070 --> 01:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
what that looks like and and how would
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
that work thank you
 
01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:46.629 align:start position:0%
that work thank you
so

01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
i think it'd be very community dependent
 
01:56:50.070 --> 01:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
communities would decide how to phase it
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
in and i'm not sure i mean the last time
 
01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
like i said this legislation was updated
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
was 13 years ago 14 years ago now
 
01:56:59.350 --> 01:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
because we're in 2022. um to put that
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
kind of in perspective in 2008 i was
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
nine years old so i'm not really i'm not
 
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
really entirely sure how communities
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
each in you know in different regions in
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
different areas we're deciding to phase
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
this in um but it would be very
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
community dependent based on how our how
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
based on how this section three is
 
01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
written and i take the section through
 
01:57:22.629 --> 01:57:22.639 align:start position:0%
exactly for langu for the previous
 
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
language that was in the originally
 
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.350 align:start position:0%
language that was in the originally
passed

01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that allowed for people to
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
phase in this property tax credit i also
 
01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
used in the other ones because i felt
 
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
it's a very good approach it allows a
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
certain amount of local control and
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
local latitude to decide based on
 
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
community revenues of how they're going
 
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to phase this in and how much
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to um you know increase to
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
get to the total state uh required
 
01:57:44.159 --> 01:57:45.750 align:start position:0%
get to the total state uh required
amounts

01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
amounts
 
01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
i see none representative
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for having
 
01:57:54.070 --> 01:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
me and thank you to the committee would
 
01:57:55.990 --> 01:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
anybody else like to testify on this
 
01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.229 align:start position:0%
anybody else like to testify on this
bill

01:57:58.229 --> 01:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
i see none i'm going to close the
 
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
hearing for
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%

we're not even waiting to stabilize to
 
02:01:05.350 --> 02:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
find out how they're affecting the
 
02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:11.189 align:start position:0%

02:01:57.669 --> 02:01:57.679 align:start position:0%
representatives davis i think i agree
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
with you that that last bill
 
02:02:02.229 --> 02:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
seems to penalize
 
02:02:06.870 --> 02:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think that was my intent i just
 
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't kind of
 
02:02:13.830 --> 02:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
get the numbers to jive in my head like
 
02:02:16.149 --> 02:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
why five here and one there and three
 
02:02:19.109 --> 02:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:21.270 --> 02:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think we shouldn't be
 
02:02:27.709 --> 02:02:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:35.430 --> 02:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
should we be
 
02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
advertising that we have a rebate for
 
02:02:57.510 --> 02:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:58.830 --> 02:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
i thought lynn
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
massachusetts was the only town that
 
02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
favors that
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
are you kidding you still can't buy
 
02:03:08.310 --> 02:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
liquor in massachusetts on sundays
 
02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:26.629 align:start position:0%
liquor in massachusetts on sundays
sure

02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:33.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:12.550 --> 02:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
my town wants this my county wants this
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
my city deserves this
 
02:04:22.069 --> 02:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
the only bills that i create we should
 
02:04:34.870 --> 02:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
yes you said
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:45.910 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:08.229 --> 02:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:08.239 --> 02:06:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:40.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:06:40.709 --> 02:06:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.719 --> 02:06:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and honorable
 
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
members of the municipal and county
 
02:06:59.109 --> 02:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
government committee
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
i come before you
 
02:07:03.189 --> 02:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
my name is excuse me suzanne vale and i
 
02:07:05.189 --> 02:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
am a new hampshire state representative
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
from nashua ward 3 which is hillsborough
 
02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
county district number 30.
 
02:07:12.149 --> 02:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
i come before you to ask for favorable
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
consideration of house bill 1342
 
02:07:17.109 --> 02:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
which is relative to the municipal
 
02:07:20.149 --> 02:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
charter provisions for tax caps
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
i filed this bill when i learned that
 
02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
the legislation that came out of this
 
02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:24.390 align:start position:0%
the legislation that came out of this
committee

02:07:24.390 --> 02:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
the last
 
02:07:25.679 --> 02:07:26.550 align:start position:0%
the last
year

02:07:26.550 --> 02:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:07:28.629 --> 02:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
became law but looking at the bill i
 
02:07:29.910 --> 02:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
felt like it still needed some
 
02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:32.709 align:start position:0%
felt like it still needed some
clarification

02:07:32.709 --> 02:07:32.719 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
02:07:33.669 --> 02:07:33.679 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
going through the bill it reverses
 
02:07:38.709 --> 02:07:38.719 align:start position:0%
changes made by senate bill 52 which was
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
filed on behalf of nashua former
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
officials who were unable to have the
 
02:07:45.030 --> 02:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
courts stop nashua
 
02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
from passing a budget
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
although the former officials were found
 
02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
to have standing to sue the city the
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
outcome was that this tax spending cap
 
02:07:58.229 --> 02:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
in nashua was not constitutional due to
 
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
having no override
 
02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:01.510 align:start position:0%
having no override
provision

02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
provision
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
this bill adds that override provision
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
where it does not currently exist
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
so if you look on line seven of the bill
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
it adds this in
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
in any circumstance in new hampshire for
 
02:08:16.629 --> 02:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
a city that has a tax cap
 
02:08:19.109 --> 02:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
there will automatically be an override
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
at least that's the intention of what
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:29.109 --> 02:08:29.119 align:start position:0%
it also removes two very long clauses
 
02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
where the law attempts to make an
 
02:08:33.669 --> 02:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
override an exclusion
 
02:08:36.069 --> 02:08:36.079 align:start position:0%
to be the same thing and they're not
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
they're two separate acts and they're
 
02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
even two separate votes
 
02:08:42.069 --> 02:08:42.079 align:start position:0%
as the law stands right now this flaw
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
exists and like all flaws found in the
 
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
law it will open up municipalities for
 
02:08:47.910 --> 02:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
further time in court over
 
02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:50.790 align:start position:0%
further time in court over
interpretation

02:08:50.790 --> 02:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
during the hearings that preceded the
 
02:08:53.910 --> 02:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
change in the law it was stated
 
02:08:56.470 --> 02:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
repeatedly that the language being added
 
02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
which is now stricken from this
 
02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
present bill before you would be
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
problematic as it was inconsistent with
 
02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
the requirement to have an override
 
02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:06.709 align:start position:0%
the requirement to have an override
provision

02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
provision
 
02:09:06.719 --> 02:09:07.990 align:start position:0%
provision
um

02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
house bill 1342 remove removes a lot of
 
02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
the confusing language
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
that was pointed out by municipal
 
02:09:18.470 --> 02:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
experts during the hearings last year
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
but to be less confusing and to have
 
02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
equivalences that aren't real
 
02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:23.589 align:start position:0%
equivalences that aren't real
on

02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:23.599 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
on in state law is probably a worse
 
02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:33.510 --> 02:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
in the case where tax cap does not have
 
02:09:35.830 --> 02:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
an override position provision it is
 
02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:39.910 align:start position:0%
an override position provision it is
here

02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:42.229 --> 02:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
and although we understand that this has
 
02:09:44.069 --> 02:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
been a nashua problem
 
02:09:44.079 --> 02:09:44.709 align:start position:0%
been a nashua problem
and

02:09:44.709 --> 02:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
the reason why there aren't co-sponsors
 
02:09:49.189 --> 02:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
from other places in the state are is
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
because this is very clearly a natural
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
problem and i hate to bring our problem
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
before you
 
02:09:54.880 --> 02:09:55.669 align:start position:0%
before you
as

02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:09:57.510 --> 02:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
a former member of the municipal county
 
02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
government committee i know what that
 
02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:00.629 align:start position:0%
government committee i know what that
means

02:10:00.629 --> 02:10:00.639 align:start position:0%
means
 
02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
so i humbly come before you
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
and apologize
 
02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:07.669 align:start position:0%
and apologize
um

um
 
02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
the other thing this bill does
 
02:10:11.910 --> 02:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
is in the very first line
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
actually in the second line the third
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's notwithstanding rsa49b
 
02:10:18.229 --> 02:10:18.239 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:20.880 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
this bill does it
 
02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
this this bill wants to undo that
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
because it feels that the other bill
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
had too many things going on in it at
 
02:10:37.750 --> 02:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
i am not a municipal lawyer i'm happy to

approached to file this bill by anyone
 
02:10:53.109 --> 02:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
in nashua city government i decided to
 
02:10:55.589 --> 02:10:55.599 align:start position:0%
file it when i heard the testimony and i
 
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
was very concerned that our family
 
02:10:59.589 --> 02:10:59.599 align:start position:0%
problem will bring problems to other
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
cities like rochester
 
02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.430 align:start position:0%

oppose it
so

02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
does anyone from the committee have
 
02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:52.870 align:start position:0%

questions
 
02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
for our representative yes
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
02:11:57.990 --> 02:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:12:00.149 --> 02:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative my
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
question pertains to page one lines
 
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
seven through nine in which you insert
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
the language shown in bold
 
02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:09.510 align:start position:0%
the language shown in bold
to

02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:12:12.629 --> 02:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
institute an override of provision upon
 
02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
two-thirds major super-majority vote of
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
the governing body
 
02:12:16.639 --> 02:12:18.149 align:start position:0%
the governing body
so

02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:21.030 --> 02:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that currently
 
02:12:23.910 --> 02:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
under our current statute that in fact
 
02:12:26.069 --> 02:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
every tax and spending cap in new
 
02:12:26.079 --> 02:12:27.430 align:start position:0%
every tax and spending cap in new
hampshire

02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
whether enacted before or after july 5th
 
02:12:30.239 --> 02:12:31.990 align:start position:0%
whether enacted before or after july 5th
2021

02:12:31.990 --> 02:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
2021
 
02:12:34.149 --> 02:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
does in fact contain a super majority
 
02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
override provision
 
02:12:40.470 --> 02:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
as provided for in sb52 that was passed
 
02:12:42.550 --> 02:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
as you stated
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
back in 2021
 
02:12:44.639 --> 02:12:45.750 align:start position:0%
back in 2021
june

02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
june
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
june 21st so my question is why is this
 
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
new necessary language why is this new
 
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
language necessary if in fact
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
all tax and spending caps in new
 
02:12:59.109 --> 02:12:59.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire have that provision could you
 
02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:06.149 --> 02:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
i don't see where it says that all
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
spending caps already have this in fact
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
in my research i don't see it anywhere
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
and then the supreme court decision
 
02:13:16.390 --> 02:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:13:18.709 --> 02:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
we were found to have no
 
02:13:18.719 --> 02:13:20.870 align:start position:0%
we were found to have no
um

02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
an unenforceable tax cap because of the
 
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
fact that it didn't have an override
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
position provision into it
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
the way that it's the way that it came
 
02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
through and sb 52 doesn't correct that
 
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
and that's that's all i have for you
 
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative mindy poody
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair are you glad to have
 
02:13:46.149 --> 02:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:48.550 --> 02:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative whale for
 
02:13:50.950 --> 02:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:13:53.350 --> 02:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that this
 
02:13:54.790 --> 02:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
tap back
 
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
tax cap
 
02:14:00.149 --> 02:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
is only spending cap is only
 
02:14:00.159 --> 02:14:01.109 align:start position:0%
is only spending cap is only
in

02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
nashua and we are the only privileged
 
02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
city to have this in the state and it
 
02:14:11.669 --> 02:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
kind of and you alluded to it by saying
 
02:14:13.990 --> 02:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
this is our problem our family we don't
 
02:14:15.750 --> 02:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
want to bring it to
 
02:14:19.189 --> 02:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
the state but state is imposing this
 
02:14:21.430 --> 02:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
isn't that correct
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
um let me try to clarify thank you for
 
02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
i guess the best way to put that is that
 
02:14:36.870 --> 02:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
in nashua people are suing the city over
 
02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
their tax cap
 
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
in other cities
 
02:14:43.189 --> 02:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
they have not been tested on their
 
02:14:46.629 --> 02:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
decision making in the courts
 
02:14:46.639 --> 02:14:47.910 align:start position:0%
decision making in the courts
however

02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:14:50.709 --> 02:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
state law is state law and there are
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
other cities
 
02:14:54.069 --> 02:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
with tax caps and i'll just make an
 
02:14:56.470 --> 02:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
example rochester
 
02:14:58.629 --> 02:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
um and this does affect them but in
 
02:15:01.030 --> 02:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
rochester they are not being taken into
 
02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
court so they have not been told
 
02:15:06.550 --> 02:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
that their um that their
 
02:15:08.229 --> 02:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
capitalism is
 
02:15:08.239 --> 02:15:09.830 align:start position:0%
capitalism is
unenforceable

02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
unenforceable
 
02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
and so this is attempt to make it
 
02:15:15.910 --> 02:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
enforceable for everyone without adding
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
exclusions and other language that has
 
02:15:22.390 --> 02:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
been found to be confusing in the past
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
and to to change what's already gone
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
through the supreme court may bring us
 
02:15:29.589 --> 02:15:29.599 align:start position:0%
right back into the supreme court
 
02:15:32.229 --> 02:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
and i wouldn't wish that on any town
 
02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative klee
 
02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
your testimony and for full disclosure i
 
02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:42.950 align:start position:0%
your testimony and for full disclosure i
am

02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
am
 
02:15:46.950 --> 02:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
a an alderman in um in nashua
 
02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:47.990 align:start position:0%
a an alderman in um in nashua
so

02:15:47.990 --> 02:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
this does impact us and um
 
02:15:53.030 --> 02:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative vale is as you're aware
 
02:15:55.030 --> 02:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
it was the spending cap that we went to
 
02:15:57.350 --> 02:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
the supreme court with that said it was
 
02:16:00.310 --> 02:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
um unconstitutional because our spending
 
02:16:04.069 --> 02:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
cap did not have any form of override
 
02:16:04.079 --> 02:16:04.950 align:start position:0%
cap did not have any form of override
this

02:16:04.950 --> 02:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:16:08.069 --> 02:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
bill my first question is if i may this
 
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
bill is not to
 
02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
eliminate what the the general court did
 
02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
last year correct it's it's just to put
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
in this override and ensure that the
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
override has the two-thirds majority
 
02:16:23.830 --> 02:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
keeping with what we believe was
 
02:16:26.149 --> 02:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
probably the intention of the
 
02:16:28.709 --> 02:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
of the original bill is that correct
 
02:16:31.350 --> 02:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
yes it is it is intended to
 
02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
carry forth the intention of the
 
02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:33.990 align:start position:0%

statute
 
02:16:37.830 --> 02:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately in our tax cap we did
 
02:16:40.389 --> 02:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
we were not in compliance with this and
 
02:16:42.469 --> 02:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
so we that was something that we needed
 
02:16:42.479 --> 02:16:43.589 align:start position:0%
so we that was something that we needed
to

02:16:43.589 --> 02:16:43.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:16:43.599 --> 02:16:45.190 align:start position:0%
to
address

02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
in our own town and that's where i say
 
02:16:49.750 --> 02:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
this is just our it's not just our
 
02:16:51.270 --> 02:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
problem it's our problem because we
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
brought it
 
02:16:54.709 --> 02:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
it's your problem because we brought it
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
to you and for that i apologize
 
02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
it's our problem because yes yes please
 
02:17:02.309 --> 02:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr chairman thank you um
 
02:17:04.709 --> 02:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
the the spending cap not the tax have
 
02:17:06.150 --> 02:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a tax that we have
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
a spending cap in nashua the spending
 
02:17:10.230 --> 02:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
cap um
 
02:17:13.349 --> 02:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
to the best of your knowledge um
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
effects even getting
 
02:17:17.190 --> 02:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
i hate to use the word free money
 
02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
because nothing is ever free but um
 
02:17:23.589 --> 02:17:23.599 align:start position:0%
grants and so on it affects us how we um
 
02:17:25.669 --> 02:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
whether it affects our spending in other
 
02:17:27.589 --> 02:17:27.599 align:start position:0%
words if we accept a grant and we spend
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
the money does it not affect that and
 
02:17:32.150 --> 02:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
not having an override can have a
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
negative effect on it and that's what
 
02:17:35.669 --> 02:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
this is to correct is that is that
 
02:17:35.679 --> 02:17:36.629 align:start position:0%
this is to correct is that is that
correct

02:17:36.629 --> 02:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:17:39.190 --> 02:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
yes there are many cases where we would
 
02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
have met the cap
 
02:17:43.429 --> 02:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
and then after the fact received grant
 
02:17:45.750 --> 02:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
money or received money from the federal
 
02:17:47.429 --> 02:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
government of some type that we're
 
02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
having difficulty to
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
work into the into this situation in
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
fact i'm not even sure what happens and
 
02:17:58.309 --> 02:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
um and i appreciate the question
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative clee because i do wonder
 
02:18:03.270 --> 02:18:03.280 align:start position:0%

as i would have liked to over the past
 
02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:08.800 align:start position:0%

02:18:24.070 --> 02:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
02:18:25.669 --> 02:18:25.679 align:start position:0%

today
um

02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
in the city of nashua can you
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
tell me
 
02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:42.070 align:start position:0%
tell me
first

02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
how was the
 
02:18:46.790 --> 02:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
spending cap or tax cap
 
02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
first put into place
 
02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
what was the was there a vote of the
 
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
townspeople to put that in place
 
02:18:58.549 --> 02:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
there was a excuse me thank you for the
 
02:19:00.629 --> 02:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
question there was a referendum boat
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
held at the time
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the tax cap was put
 
02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
into place in 1993
 
02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i want to say that we had another
 
02:19:11.950 --> 02:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
referendum on in
 
02:19:15.270 --> 02:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
2014 that was related to this
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
and i looked for the language in that
 
02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
referendum actually i was looking for
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
the question and i couldn't find it
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
so i'm sorry to not have that available
 
02:19:25.349 --> 02:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
but i can try to find what the ballot
 
02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
question was in 2014 and send that to
 
02:19:29.110 --> 02:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
you if you would
 
02:19:32.830 --> 02:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
care for that yes a follow-up please in
 
02:19:37.349 --> 02:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:39.030 --> 02:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
line number nine
 
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
you say it shall be
 
02:19:45.030 --> 02:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
there should be an override upon a
 
02:19:48.549 --> 02:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
two-thirds super-majority vote of the
 
02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
governing body can you define the
 
02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
well in this case in nashua would be the
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:03.750 --> 02:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
 
02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:04.469 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
so

02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:08.230 --> 02:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
if if the tax cap was put in place
 
02:20:12.630 --> 02:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
as a result of a referendum of all the
 
02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
voters in nashua
 
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't the governing body be
 
02:20:25.590 --> 02:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
i really appreciate that question um i'm
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
honestly stumped
 
02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
02:20:32.479 --> 02:20:33.270 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
that

02:20:33.270 --> 02:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:33.280 --> 02:20:36.550 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
that is a very inclusive
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
idea of what the referendum is what i
 
02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
can say about the referendum issue and
 
02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
what i might have a problem with is
 
02:20:48.309 --> 02:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
where we get into using
 
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
language like exclusions and exceptions
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
instead of the word override and what
 
02:20:55.990 --> 02:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
the people voted on was an override
 
02:20:57.670 --> 02:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
that's what they understand that's what
 
02:20:58.790 --> 02:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
they know
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
that's what they go by they don't go by
 
02:21:02.469 --> 02:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
any other terminology that was
 
02:21:06.469 --> 02:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
introduced by senate bill 52
 
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you and i want to go back to
 
02:21:11.349 --> 02:21:11.359 align:start position:0%

turned you down when you wanted to
 
02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
help with answering a question
 
02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
let me
 
02:21:20.469 --> 02:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
be a little more
 
02:21:22.150 --> 02:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
explanatory and maybe a little more
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
lenient on that
 
02:21:24.830 --> 02:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
if you
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
can say what you want to say in the form
 
02:21:30.150 --> 02:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
of a question
 
02:21:32.710 --> 02:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
you can you can do it like and
 
02:21:34.150 --> 02:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
02:21:35.830 --> 02:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
type of thing if you want you want to
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
start like that and i'll let you i'll
 
02:21:40.309 --> 02:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
let you go on that direction
 
02:21:42.309 --> 02:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i do have a
 
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
another question after that but i'll
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
leave it up to you as to whether or not
 
02:21:46.469 --> 02:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
i can continue
 
02:21:46.479 --> 02:21:50.389 align:start position:0%
i can continue
um

02:21:50.389 --> 02:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
i'm never very good at
 
02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
this guess i could do the would you
 
02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
believe um
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
you had question about the the the grant
 
02:22:02.230 --> 02:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
monies and um
 
02:22:05.190 --> 02:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
would you believe that unless
 
02:22:09.910 --> 02:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
the money was anticipated and budgeted
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
that that money would have to in fact be
 
02:22:14.230 --> 02:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
turned back if it brought the city
 
02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:15.830 align:start position:0%
turned back if it brought the city
beyond

02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
the um spending cap and it's not a tax
 
02:22:21.349 --> 02:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
cap it's a spending cap
 
02:22:21.359 --> 02:22:23.510 align:start position:0%
cap it's a spending cap
where

02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:24.950 align:start position:0%
where
because

02:22:24.950 --> 02:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
a spending cap affects
 
02:22:30.070 --> 02:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
spending and not tax because it's tax
 
02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
you said yes
 
02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you yes
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
even a follow-up also uh
 
02:22:45.429 --> 02:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
02:22:47.349 --> 02:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
to to a question that another
 
02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
representative had had asked about
 
02:22:54.070 --> 02:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
the two-thirds to the entire
 
02:22:54.080 --> 02:22:57.750 align:start position:0%
the two-thirds to the entire
city

02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:59.429 --> 02:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
where nashua would you believe that
 
02:23:01.670 --> 02:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
nashua does their budget annually and we
 
02:23:03.910 --> 02:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
would have to anytime we had an override
 
02:23:05.590 --> 02:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
like this we would actually have to call
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
for a special election at a very high
 
02:23:10.150 --> 02:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
cost to the entire
 
02:23:14.309 --> 02:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:16.550 --> 02:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
public hearings
 
02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:24.469 --> 02:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
that's my would you believe
 
02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
the best of my ability to do i i would i
 
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
would certainly believe that and i
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
i guess that even
 
02:23:33.750 --> 02:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
that explains why i'm stumped by the
 
02:23:36.070 --> 02:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
question it's just like overwhelmingly
 
02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
mind-blowing to me that we could ever
 
02:23:40.630 --> 02:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
that that's what it would bring us to i
 
02:23:43.590 --> 02:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
mean we would be voting on everything
 
02:23:46.309 --> 02:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
if we could vote on one thing and that
 
02:23:48.389 --> 02:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
would change our town of our form of
 
02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
town government
 
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
our city government so
 
02:23:53.830 --> 02:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question and i hope
 
02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:55.030 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question and i hope
i've

02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
i've
 
02:23:56.469 --> 02:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
reflected back to you what we were
 
02:24:01.190 --> 02:24:01.200 align:start position:0%

02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:12.870 align:start position:0%

that
 
02:24:15.190 --> 02:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
had a severe impact on the city of

nashua
 
02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:18.560 align:start position:0%

02:24:21.190 --> 02:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding with several
 
02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
or one charitable organizations in the
 
02:24:27.110 --> 02:24:27.120 align:start position:0%

other agencies or private donors to

address the natural emergency
 
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
that was and then the funds collected
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
for that purpose exceeded the spending
 
02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:38.790 align:start position:0%

and just look at a few things no
 
02:27:39.270 --> 02:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
personal names mentioned but um the
 
02:27:41.670 --> 02:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
performing arts center and its bond
 
02:27:44.070 --> 02:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
situation then there's the replacing of
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
elm street school with its ever growing

myrtle street projects with their
 
02:27:55.910 --> 02:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
expansion all and all of its associated
 
02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
hidden expenses ready to surface in the
 
02:28:00.309 --> 02:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
form of consequences in the years to
 
02:28:00.319 --> 02:28:01.510 align:start position:0%
form of consequences in the years to
come

02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
come
 
02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
and did any city employees get
 
02:28:05.429 --> 02:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
furloughed in the coveted closures of
 
02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
city hall library schools or other city
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
entities while countless private sector
 
02:28:12.389 --> 02:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
employees were sent to the unemployment
 
02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
line and back to that art center in 2017
 
02:28:18.309 --> 02:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
my alderman said he didn't care that it
 
02:28:20.230 --> 02:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
was a money pit and that he wanted it
 
02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
anyways sadly for the whole city and not
 
02:28:24.630 --> 02:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
just his constituents he was reelected
 
02:28:27.030 --> 02:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
in the past two elections and the next
 
02:28:28.630 --> 02:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get rid of him is not
 
02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
until the end of next year
 
02:28:33.429 --> 02:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
this bill is not about new hampshire as
 
02:28:37.030 --> 02:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned it is about nashua
 
02:28:39.990 --> 02:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
if it was about other cities
 
02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:41.030 align:start position:0%
if it was about other cities
other

02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:28:43.190 --> 02:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
city people would be jumping on the
 
02:28:45.190 --> 02:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor bandwagon this is a baseless
 
02:28:46.710 --> 02:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
attack on sb
 
02:28:50.469 --> 02:28:50.479 align:start position:0%

02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
and it's available for any member of the
 
02:29:31.349 --> 02:29:31.359 align:start position:0%

from that website
 
02:29:44.469 --> 02:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
which is disappointing but
 
02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:46.560 align:start position:0%

02:29:57.030 --> 02:29:57.040 align:start position:0%

02:29:57.040 --> 02:29:59.349 align:start position:0%
something in his uh in the um in our
emails

02:30:09.990 --> 02:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:30:12.550 --> 02:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:30:14.230 --> 02:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering how
 
02:30:16.230 --> 02:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
the people who are making the decisions
 
02:30:18.710 --> 02:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
of spending in nashua which i understand
 
02:30:20.230 --> 02:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
you disagree with
 
02:30:22.630 --> 02:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
are they elected by the people in nashua
 
02:30:24.550 --> 02:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
or are they appointed
 
02:30:26.070 --> 02:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
i mean are
 
02:30:27.750 --> 02:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
are the the residents of nashua
 
02:30:29.270 --> 02:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
selecting who they want to make these
 
02:30:29.280 --> 02:30:30.550 align:start position:0%
selecting who they want to make these
decisions

02:30:30.550 --> 02:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
02:30:32.230 --> 02:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
well there's evidence out there that the
 
02:30:34.389 --> 02:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
voting machines are selecting them but
 
02:30:36.790 --> 02:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's inconclusive
 
02:30:39.429 --> 02:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:30:41.830 --> 02:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:30:43.270 --> 02:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much thank
 
02:30:44.830 --> 02:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
you mr
 
02:30:47.429 --> 02:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
chair there anybody else from the
 
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
audience or from the committee would
 
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:31:04.630 --> 02:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open the hearing on 13.50
 
02:31:09.750 --> 02:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
well i gotta wait two more minutes
 
02:31:12.389 --> 02:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
before i can do that so
 
02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:34.870 --> 02:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
you know the thing is that
 
02:31:36.550 --> 02:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
there was a conversation about let's try
 
02:31:39.750 --> 02:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:39.760 --> 02:31:40.830 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:31:40.830 --> 02:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:43.270 --> 02:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
body let it be but let's just fix it so
 
02:31:45.670 --> 02:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
nashville has the ability to override i
 
02:31:47.110 --> 02:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
very specifically went and looked and
 
02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
all if there was a majority i changed it
 
02:31:52.070 --> 02:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
i said that you should search
 
02:32:04.950 --> 02:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:04.960 --> 02:32:30.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:32:30.790 --> 02:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:32.389 --> 02:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
it's looking i think it's looking
 
02:32:32.399 --> 02:32:33.590 align:start position:0%
it's looking i think it's looking
favorable

02:32:33.590 --> 02:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
favorable
 
02:32:34.389 --> 02:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:32:36.150 --> 02:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
settled pretty soon i don't know any of
 
02:32:38.230 --> 02:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
the aspects that would be inappropriate
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
for me to know any of the negotiations
 
02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
but we did just pass the supervisors and
 
02:32:44.550 --> 02:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
the paris
 
02:32:45.750 --> 02:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:32:48.389 --> 02:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
and they kind of restructured it and and
 
02:32:50.389 --> 02:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
the food service so we restructured it
 
02:32:52.710 --> 02:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
so that they work on a grade scale
 
02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
with a step increase annually up to for
 
02:32:57.670 --> 02:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
like 20 years i think it is
 
02:33:00.790 --> 02:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
the way that they are yeah
 
02:33:19.830 --> 02:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:19.840 --> 02:38:28.389 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:38:28.389 --> 02:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:30.150 --> 02:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to get started again on our
 
02:38:34.870 --> 02:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
which would be hb 1350.
 
02:38:39.750 --> 02:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
before we get too deep into that though
 
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
i want to mention we are having some
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
administrative issues with
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
how people
 
02:38:50.790 --> 02:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
can put input into the into our
 
02:38:53.349 --> 02:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
legislative system so that those of us
 
02:38:55.349 --> 02:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
who are committee members can see it
 
02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
prior to the
 
02:38:58.389 --> 02:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
the hearings
 
02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
and that's been brought forward to the
 
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
folks who manage that for us it's a
 
02:39:03.670 --> 02:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
relatively new system
 
02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:04.950 align:start position:0%
relatively new system
uh

02:39:04.950 --> 02:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
like you probably heard me in the last
 
02:39:10.070 --> 02:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh hearing that i hadn't heard from mr t
 
02:39:13.270 --> 02:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
boom well his testimony had been input
 
02:39:15.670 --> 02:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
unbeknownst to me and it went into our
 
02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:16.870 align:start position:0%
unbeknownst to me and it went into our
system

02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:39:19.429 --> 02:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
that doesn't automatically come to
 
02:39:20.469 --> 02:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
all of you
 
02:39:22.870 --> 02:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
unless you go search for it
 
02:39:25.990 --> 02:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's to me is that's a uh
 
02:39:26.950 --> 02:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
limitation in our system that needs to
 
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
be fixed so that so that if you are a
 
02:39:32.630 --> 02:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative you don't have to go
 
02:39:34.870 --> 02:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
search for a testimony it should come
 
02:39:37.030 --> 02:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
right to you
 
02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
so we're going to be working on that
 
02:39:41.670 --> 02:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's not a
 
02:39:43.429 --> 02:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
it's not a failure of our ability to
 
02:39:43.439 --> 02:39:44.389 align:start position:0%
it's not a failure of our ability to
keep

02:39:44.389 --> 02:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
keep
 
02:39:46.230 --> 02:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
keep moving forward but it's a
 
02:39:48.550 --> 02:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
limitation and that we should recognize
 
02:39:49.990 --> 02:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that from time to time we're
 
02:39:51.429 --> 02:39:51.439 align:start position:0%
going to have people
 
02:39:53.270 --> 02:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
who have submitted testimony that we're
 
02:39:56.309 --> 02:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
not going to see beforehand and i would
 
02:39:58.389 --> 02:39:58.399 align:start position:0%
hope that we would
 
02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
educate each other
 
02:40:03.510 --> 02:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
if if you are aware of testimony that's
 
02:40:05.270 --> 02:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
sitting out there
 
02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:06.389 align:start position:0%
sitting out there
and

02:40:06.389 --> 02:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:40:08.469 --> 02:40:08.479 align:start position:0%
as the chairman if i'm not
 
02:40:10.150 --> 02:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
and i mentioned that i haven't seen it
 
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
if you have i would appreciate it if you
 
02:40:15.269 --> 02:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
bring it up so we can
 
02:40:18.070 --> 02:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
all be enlightened
 
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%

02:41:59.429 --> 02:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
not for the reasons of having a reval or
 
02:42:01.670 --> 02:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
the citizens right to request that but
 
02:42:03.830 --> 02:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
because there are already four avenues
 
02:42:05.910 --> 02:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
within the law that allow for the
 
02:42:08.550 --> 02:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
petition for reassessments the two most
 
02:42:11.269 --> 02:42:11.279 align:start position:0%
common are the board of tax and land use
 
02:42:13.269 --> 02:42:13.279 align:start position:0%
appeals and the dra those are most
 
02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
commonly used however
 
02:42:18.469 --> 02:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
rsa 71b allows a petition to the
 
02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
governing body by individuals or by 50
 
02:42:24.230 --> 02:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in the district or a third of
 
02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers of the district to have a
 
02:42:29.190 --> 02:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
reevaluation which is a lower threshold
 
02:42:31.510 --> 02:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
than what the bill currently contains
 
02:42:34.070 --> 02:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
as well as by petition warrant article
 
02:42:37.349 --> 02:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
under rsa 39.3 which also then would
 
02:42:40.070 --> 02:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
have a lower threshold
 
02:42:42.309 --> 02:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
which would be 25 or more of registered
 
02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
voters in that case or a 2 percent of
 
02:42:49.269 --> 02:42:49.279 align:start position:0%
registered voters in the municipality
 
02:42:52.550 --> 02:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
rsa 71b does prescribe an orderly
 
02:42:54.550 --> 02:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
process and set forth sets forth
 
02:42:57.429 --> 02:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
criteria procedures and how expenses
 
02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
associated with any kind of reassessment
 
02:43:02.630 --> 02:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
should be handled and further this bill
 
02:43:05.110 --> 02:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't define what full value
 
02:43:07.750 --> 02:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
revaluation is
 
02:43:08.950 --> 02:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
we are
 
02:43:11.269 --> 02:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
unsure of the purpose or the intent of
 
02:43:13.429 --> 02:43:13.439 align:start position:0%
this legislation as it seems to be
 
02:43:13.439 --> 02:43:15.269 align:start position:0%
this legislation as it seems to be
redundant

02:43:15.269 --> 02:43:15.279 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
02:43:17.510 --> 02:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
as there's already approved ways for
 
02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:18.469 align:start position:0%
as there's already approved ways for
which

02:43:18.469 --> 02:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:43:21.269 --> 02:43:21.279 align:start position:0%
residents taxpayers can
 
02:43:23.510 --> 02:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
move forward with the reevaluation
 
02:43:26.309 --> 02:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
process should they have questions
 
02:43:28.150 --> 02:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
i can now take any questions anybody
 
02:43:29.510 --> 02:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
from the committee have a question for
 
02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:32.150 align:start position:0%
from the committee have a question for
nhma

02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:34.710 --> 02:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for your
 
02:43:41.269 --> 02:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
testimony so uh
 
02:43:44.550 --> 02:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
from your testimony uh am i correct in
 
02:43:47.269 --> 02:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
understanding the avenues already exist
 
02:43:49.590 --> 02:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
multiple avenues exist
 
02:43:52.070 --> 02:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
this will create of
 
02:43:55.429 --> 02:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
additional more confusing am i correct
 
02:43:55.439 --> 02:43:57.349 align:start position:0%
additional more confusing am i correct
or

02:43:57.349 --> 02:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:43:59.670 --> 02:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
will it counter any of the existing
 
02:43:59.680 --> 02:44:00.790 align:start position:0%
will it counter any of the existing
avenues

02:44:00.790 --> 02:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
avenues
 
02:44:03.510 --> 02:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
it looks to create a fifth avenue an
 
02:44:05.750 --> 02:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
additional avenue however there's some
 
02:44:08.150 --> 02:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
confusing language in it as
 
02:44:11.590 --> 02:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
i stated not defining the full
 
02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
revaluation for instance
 
02:44:16.070 --> 02:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
so that would be one area and we just
 
02:44:18.469 --> 02:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
believe that we're not sure what problem
 
02:44:20.870 --> 02:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
this is currently trying to address this
 
02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:21.750 align:start position:0%
this is currently trying to address this
bill

02:44:21.750 --> 02:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:44:24.389 --> 02:44:24.399 align:start position:0%
thank you apparently uh
 
02:44:27.190 --> 02:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
three folks have
 
02:44:28.710 --> 02:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
brought forth their support for this
 
02:44:32.469 --> 02:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
bill while 18 oppose it more questions
 
02:44:36.070 --> 02:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:37.349 --> 02:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:44:38.950 --> 02:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:40.150 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:44:40.150 --> 02:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:43.030 --> 02:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
from the nhma
 
02:44:45.190 --> 02:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
point of view are are you aware of the
 
02:44:47.429 --> 02:44:47.439 align:start position:0%
the cost of
 
02:44:50.150 --> 02:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
a municipality having to
 
02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:51.190 align:start position:0%
a municipality having to
do

02:44:51.190 --> 02:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:44:52.710 --> 02:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
an evaluation especially a full
 
02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
evaluation and i'm not really sure if
 
02:44:56.150 --> 02:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
they're talking about a full measure and
 
02:44:56.160 --> 02:44:57.510 align:start position:0%
they're talking about a full measure and
list

02:44:57.510 --> 02:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
list
 
02:44:59.429 --> 02:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
or if they're just talking about doing a
 
02:45:01.990 --> 02:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
city-wide reevaluation but in either
 
02:45:03.750 --> 02:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
case the cost are you aware of the cost
 
02:45:05.190 --> 02:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
of revel
 
02:45:08.230 --> 02:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
outside of the normal procedure and what
 
02:45:10.950 --> 02:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
it would do to somebody's budget etc
 
02:45:13.269 --> 02:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
yes we are very aware of the cost they
 
02:45:14.870 --> 02:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
are extremely
 
02:45:16.710 --> 02:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
time and cost
 
02:45:18.630 --> 02:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
it would be cost prohibitive
 
02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
and we again agree believe that this
 
02:45:23.349 --> 02:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
bill would not
 
02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
solve for any problem that is currently
 
02:45:28.710 --> 02:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
not already addressed in the law
 
02:45:31.190 --> 02:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
just uh think about your
 
02:45:35.830 --> 02:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
report of
 
02:45:37.590 --> 02:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
support and oppose
 
02:45:38.630 --> 02:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
02:45:40.710 --> 02:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
thankful for my colleague here
 
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative gilman that's looking
 
02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:43.910 align:start position:0%
representative gilman that's looking
online

02:45:43.910 --> 02:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
online
 
02:45:47.110 --> 02:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
looks like there is three support and 28
 
02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:48.150 align:start position:0%
looks like there is three support and 28
opposed

02:45:48.150 --> 02:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
02:45:51.190 --> 02:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
could it be that people can still
 
02:45:54.870 --> 02:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
do it while we are in session until it
 
02:45:57.510 --> 02:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
closes so it could be a discrepancy of
 
02:45:59.910 --> 02:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
10 opposed
 
02:46:01.030 --> 02:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:08.469 --> 02:46:08.479 align:start position:0%
so i'm just documenting that as of you
 
02:46:10.710 --> 02:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
know from your data to
 
02:46:13.670 --> 02:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
the current online it's already a 10
 
02:46:13.680 --> 02:46:14.710 align:start position:0%
the current online it's already a 10
difference

02:46:14.710 --> 02:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:46:16.309 --> 02:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:46:17.830 --> 02:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%

02:46:28.550 --> 02:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
under current new hampshire statute we
 
02:46:32.309 --> 02:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
already have four avenues by which
 
02:46:33.990 --> 02:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
residents may petition the local
 
02:46:35.750 --> 02:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
governing body to
 
02:46:38.469 --> 02:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
do a re-evaluation of property could you

in which
 
02:46:48.550 --> 02:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
this type of re-evaluation might be
 
02:46:51.030 --> 02:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
warranted or necessary thank you
 
02:46:52.550 --> 02:46:52.560 align:start position:0%

miss heck had stated that under current
 
02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:40.560 align:start position:0%

such a re-evaluation of property may be
 
02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.469 align:start position:0%
such a re-evaluation of property may be
necessary

02:48:00.469 --> 02:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:48:02.550 --> 02:48:02.560 align:start position:0%

constitutionally and statutorily to go
 
02:48:10.710 --> 02:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
through a reassessment of property once
 
02:48:14.070 --> 02:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:14.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:48:14.830 --> 02:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:17.349 --> 02:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
if let's assume somebody's you're in
 
02:48:18.950 --> 02:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
your second or third year after your
 
02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
last rebel
 
02:48:23.510 --> 02:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
and um you have residents property
 
02:48:25.590 --> 02:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
owners uh who
 
02:48:28.150 --> 02:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh have noticed that the ratio
 
02:48:29.750 --> 02:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
is out of whack your your annual
 
02:48:31.910 --> 02:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
assessment ratio each community
 
02:48:34.150 --> 02:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
develops with the dra
 
02:48:35.990 --> 02:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
and not maybe just that the assessment
 
02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
ratio is out of whack but how far you
 
02:48:42.389 --> 02:48:42.399 align:start position:0%
disperse from that median ratio how how
 
02:48:44.230 --> 02:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
equitable so if you're at a median ratio
 
02:48:45.590 --> 02:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
of 80
 
02:48:48.150 --> 02:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
um do you disperse from that by 10
 
02:48:50.309 --> 02:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
points 20 points there are statistical
 
02:48:52.630 --> 02:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
measurements that the dra would use the
 
02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
statistical measurements that assessors
 
02:48:57.590 --> 02:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
use btla would use um so it's it's
 
02:48:59.670 --> 02:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
conceivable that you could get into a
 
02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
situation where you have an inequitable
 
02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:02.870 align:start position:0%
situation where you have an inequitable
situation

02:49:02.870 --> 02:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:49:05.349 --> 02:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
that happens before the five years are
 
02:49:11.110 --> 02:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:13.750 --> 02:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
mr misho um
 
02:49:15.670 --> 02:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
could you explain a little bit for the
 
02:49:18.230 --> 02:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
committee the uh the numbers we hear so
 
02:49:19.429 --> 02:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
often the
 
02:49:23.750 --> 02:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
the 90 to 90 to 100 110 numbers and what
 
02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
they mean for a community
 
02:49:28.630 --> 02:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh giving the question to
 
02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:29.429 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh giving the question to
me

02:49:29.429 --> 02:49:29.439 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:49:31.670 --> 02:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
so uh in the year of reevaluation
 
02:49:33.269 --> 02:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
hudson's going through a reevaluation
 
02:49:35.990 --> 02:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
for this year 2022. our goal is to head
 
02:49:37.990 --> 02:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
100 of market value
 
02:49:40.389 --> 02:49:40.399 align:start position:0%
in the statutes they defined uh full and
 
02:49:44.630 --> 02:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
true market value as between 90 and 110
 
02:49:46.550 --> 02:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's meant to allow for
 
02:49:48.710 --> 02:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
um it becomes
 
02:49:50.630 --> 02:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
difficult especially we go to a smaller
 
02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:51.670 align:start position:0%
difficult especially we go to a smaller
community

02:49:51.670 --> 02:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:49:55.190 --> 02:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
um to always hit that sweet spot of 100
 
02:49:57.590 --> 02:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
and so there's an allowance to be plus
 
02:49:59.830 --> 02:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
or minus 10 of full and true market
 
02:50:02.710 --> 02:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
value even in the year of reassessment
 
02:50:04.870 --> 02:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
um and and that can happen because the
 
02:50:06.870 --> 02:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
economy is uh the housing market's a
 
02:50:09.510 --> 02:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
little disjointed um that can happen for
 
02:50:12.309 --> 02:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
a variety of reasons um but that's
 
02:50:13.830 --> 02:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's our standard that we are
 
02:50:17.190 --> 02:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
that we are held to for reassessment and
 
02:50:19.990 --> 02:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
so they measure the qualified sales that
 
02:50:22.550 --> 02:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
happen in your community dra
 
02:50:24.790 --> 02:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
and then they compare that to the
 
02:50:26.389 --> 02:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
assessed value
 
02:50:28.550 --> 02:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
for all of those and that's how the
 
02:50:30.870 --> 02:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
median assessment ratio is arrived at
 
02:50:32.710 --> 02:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
that's a very quick way of describing
 
02:50:34.070 --> 02:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
02:50:35.990 --> 02:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for miss
 
02:50:38.309 --> 02:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
heck or mr micho
 
02:50:40.469 --> 02:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
02:50:42.870 --> 02:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
my good friend
 
02:50:45.110 --> 02:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh and thank you mr
 
02:50:47.110 --> 02:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
micho for taking my question i think
 
02:50:48.790 --> 02:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's directed at you am i to understand
 
02:50:50.710 --> 02:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
that if you had a cod if it was at a
 
02:50:52.950 --> 02:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
hundred percent there still could be a
 
02:50:52.960 --> 02:50:54.070 align:start position:0%
hundred percent there still could be a
petition

02:50:54.070 --> 02:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
petition
 
02:50:56.150 --> 02:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
a legal petition that could come through
 
02:50:57.750 --> 02:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
for a reval
 
02:50:59.590 --> 02:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
for which then the town would be
 
02:51:01.750 --> 02:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
obligated provided there wasn't a
 
02:51:04.950 --> 02:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
spending cap that they were in if that
 
02:51:07.349 --> 02:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't a problem they would be required
 
02:51:10.710 --> 02:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
then to do another reval
 
02:51:13.110 --> 02:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
um thank you for asking the question i i
 
02:51:14.870 --> 02:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
believe you meant if the community is at
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
an assessment ratio of 100
 
02:51:20.950 --> 02:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
and the community had a warrant article
 
02:51:23.830 --> 02:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
telling it to do another reassessment
 
02:51:27.910 --> 02:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:30.469 --> 02:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
that's my question that that is above my
 
02:51:32.630 --> 02:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
pay grade that is a that is a legal
 
02:51:34.150 --> 02:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
question that's not a dodge that is a
 
02:51:36.469 --> 02:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
legal question i believe thank you thank
 
02:51:38.230 --> 02:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
you representative any other further
 
02:51:38.240 --> 02:51:39.110 align:start position:0%
you representative any other further
questions

02:51:39.110 --> 02:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:39.990 align:start position:0%
questions
yes

02:51:39.990 --> 02:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:41.670 align:start position:0%
yes
representative

02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:51:43.429 --> 02:51:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:51:44.550 --> 02:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:51:44.560 --> 02:51:47.830 align:start position:0%
my question
uh

02:51:47.830 --> 02:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:50.389 --> 02:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
since we have to do a uh reevaluation
 
02:51:52.469 --> 02:51:52.479 align:start position:0%
every five years i i can assume that
 
02:51:55.269 --> 02:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
it's a staggered reevaluation
 
02:51:57.750 --> 02:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
would the reason for
 
02:52:01.510 --> 02:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh requesting evaluation be due to
 
02:52:01.520 --> 02:52:02.870 align:start position:0%
uh requesting evaluation be due to
uh

02:52:02.870 --> 02:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:52:05.670 --> 02:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
people that have just been re evaluated
 
02:52:07.510 --> 02:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh due to the increase in their
 
02:52:09.670 --> 02:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
valuation uh
 
02:52:11.590 --> 02:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
feel that they're
 
02:52:15.750 --> 02:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:16.710 --> 02:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:52:18.950 --> 02:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative um i people have all
 
02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
sorts of reasons i would imagine why
 
02:52:22.309 --> 02:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
they feel a reassessment should be done
 
02:52:24.630 --> 02:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
one of them could be that um if the
 
02:52:26.230 --> 02:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
average increase in the community for
 
02:52:28.309 --> 02:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
assessed value not taxes assessed value
 
02:52:29.510 --> 02:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
is 30
 
02:52:31.429 --> 02:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
if they went up 31 percent they may feel
 
02:52:32.870 --> 02:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's wrong
 
02:52:34.630 --> 02:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
right and so they may want to pursue
 
02:52:34.640 --> 02:52:35.429 align:start position:0%
right and so they may want to pursue
that

02:52:35.429 --> 02:52:35.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:52:37.910 --> 02:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
um on the other hand
 
02:52:39.110 --> 02:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
folks could
 
02:52:40.830 --> 02:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
look at the results of a
 
02:52:43.190 --> 02:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
re-evaluation and
 
02:52:44.790 --> 02:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
and discover that the coefficient of
 
02:52:46.469 --> 02:52:46.479 align:start position:0%
dispersion was higher after the
 
02:52:47.990 --> 02:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
re-evaluation than it was before the
 
02:52:50.469 --> 02:52:50.479 align:start position:0%
re-evaluation so there's less equity you
 
02:52:52.550 --> 02:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
actually created less equity as a result
 
02:52:54.389 --> 02:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
of rebel i don't find that to be a
 
02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
common occurrence anecdotally
 
02:52:59.030 --> 02:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue provides
 
02:53:01.269 --> 02:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
oversight of every reassessment that's
 
02:53:03.910 --> 02:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
done in the state um so they see
 
02:53:06.710 --> 02:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
advanced information and i i would not
 
02:53:08.070 --> 02:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
find it likely
 
02:53:08.080 --> 02:53:09.110 align:start position:0%
find it likely
that

02:53:09.110 --> 02:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:53:13.349 --> 02:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
we'll say a a less than good revaluation
 
02:53:15.349 --> 02:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh would be able to reach its conclusion
 
02:53:17.110 --> 02:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
before somebody raises the alarm at the
 
02:53:18.950 --> 02:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
state level to the board of slackman to
 
02:53:21.269 --> 02:53:21.279 align:start position:0%
the local governing body
 
02:53:22.830 --> 02:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that answers your
 
02:53:25.830 --> 02:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
question follow up hold up please
 
02:53:25.840 --> 02:53:26.710 align:start position:0%
question follow up hold up please
uh

02:53:26.710 --> 02:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:53:26.720 --> 02:53:28.389 align:start position:0%
uh
well

02:53:28.389 --> 02:53:28.399 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:53:32.630 --> 02:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:35.590 --> 02:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
dairy does its re-evaluation
 
02:53:35.600 --> 02:53:36.630 align:start position:0%
dairy does its re-evaluation
like

02:53:36.630 --> 02:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:53:38.630 --> 02:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
20 percent every year
 
02:53:40.230 --> 02:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:53:42.389 --> 02:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
there are there are people that when i
 
02:53:44.389 --> 02:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
was on the console would come to me and
 
02:53:46.710 --> 02:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
say well we just got reevaluated and my
 
02:53:49.510 --> 02:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
taxes went up you know 50
 
02:53:52.309 --> 02:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem fair and i would ask
 
02:53:52.319 --> 02:53:53.510 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem fair and i would ask
them

02:53:53.510 --> 02:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:53:55.269 --> 02:53:55.279 align:start position:0%
well do you ever consider that maybe you
 
02:53:58.469 --> 02:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
were under paying your taxes
 
02:54:00.790 --> 02:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
does is that the sort of rationale that
 
02:54:02.389 --> 02:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
you believe would be a
 
02:54:05.030 --> 02:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
cause for a re-evaluation
 
02:54:05.040 --> 02:54:07.110 align:start position:0%
cause for a re-evaluation
request

02:54:07.110 --> 02:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:54:09.190 --> 02:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question i'm i'm
 
02:54:11.590 --> 02:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
having a little difficulty i i think in
 
02:54:14.550 --> 02:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
derry you guys uh had been in a in a
 
02:54:17.429 --> 02:54:17.439 align:start position:0%
cycle of data collection where 20 of the
 
02:54:20.070 --> 02:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
property had somebody visit it
 
02:54:21.269 --> 02:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
on site
 
02:54:23.750 --> 02:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
maybe do an interior not today
 
02:54:25.110 --> 02:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
but maybe do an interior and certainly
 
02:54:26.790 --> 02:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
do an exterior review
 
02:54:29.750 --> 02:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
so they're they're confirming data right
 
02:54:31.510 --> 02:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
is the data correct
 
02:54:33.510 --> 02:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think that they were reassessing
 
02:54:34.790 --> 02:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
that 20
 
02:54:36.550 --> 02:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
to full and true market value and
 
02:54:39.429 --> 02:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
leaving the other 80 percent
 
02:54:40.870 --> 02:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know that that's what derry was
 
02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
doing i i think they were and hudson has
 
02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
done a cycle of data collection where
 
02:54:47.990 --> 02:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
we're confirming data so yep now is a
 
02:54:50.550 --> 02:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
finished basement and there's a pool and
 
02:54:51.510 --> 02:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
people didn't know they had to get
 
02:54:54.469 --> 02:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
permits i guess and um now now their
 
02:54:56.309 --> 02:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
assessment went up a lot but they're not
 
02:54:57.590 --> 02:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
being assessed to phone through market
 
02:55:00.070 --> 02:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
value we're just correcting data
 
02:55:01.910 --> 02:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
pool is there pool is not there things
 
02:55:04.150 --> 02:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
like that um and it's a good it's a good
 
02:55:06.070 --> 02:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
process to go through to to cleanse your
 
02:55:08.150 --> 02:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
data for lack of a better word
 
02:55:10.790 --> 02:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr micho um
 
02:55:13.030 --> 02:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
in order to keep our records straight uh
 
02:55:15.030 --> 02:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
historically could i get you to fill out
 
02:55:16.630 --> 02:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
one of these pink cards
 
02:55:18.790 --> 02:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
of course yes and miss heck you can help
 
02:55:21.429 --> 02:55:21.439 align:start position:0%
him uh they're over there
 
02:55:22.950 --> 02:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:55:24.950 --> 02:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative please
 
02:55:26.950 --> 02:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and uh thank you
 
02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
ms michael for taking my um my question
 
02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:30.950 align:start position:0%
ms michael for taking my um my question
um

02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:33.510 --> 02:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
we we all know that um if all things
 
02:55:36.070 --> 02:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
were equal and every house went up ten
 
02:55:37.910 --> 02:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
percent we wouldn't see any change in
 
02:55:39.269 --> 02:55:39.279 align:start position:0%
anybody's tax
 
02:55:42.830 --> 02:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
taxes paid and so on as they say is as a
 
02:55:46.309 --> 02:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
river uh rises all boats float
 
02:55:47.990 --> 02:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
and and you pointed out that the dra
 
02:55:49.349 --> 02:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
approves the rio valley and makes
 
02:55:49.359 --> 02:55:50.469 align:start position:0%
approves the rio valley and makes
corrections

02:55:50.469 --> 02:55:50.479 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
02:55:50.479 --> 02:55:52.710 align:start position:0%
corrections
however

02:55:52.710 --> 02:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:55:55.269 --> 02:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
right now we have this statute of every
 
02:55:57.910 --> 02:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
five years but can communities whether
 
02:56:00.150 --> 02:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
it be city or town
 
02:56:02.870 --> 02:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
do this more often i i've heard of other
 
02:56:02.880 --> 02:56:04.070 align:start position:0%
do this more often i i've heard of other
communities

02:56:04.070 --> 02:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:56:05.830 --> 02:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
they do it once a year to capture the
 
02:56:07.269 --> 02:56:07.279 align:start position:0%
growth of the
 
02:56:07.279 --> 02:56:08.710 align:start position:0%
growth of the
um

02:56:08.710 --> 02:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:10.630 --> 02:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
of how value evaluations are changing
 
02:56:12.870 --> 02:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
from small homes to large homes etc
 
02:56:14.389 --> 02:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
02:56:15.510 --> 02:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:56:17.190 --> 02:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
representative certainly communities can
 
02:56:19.030 --> 02:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
decide to do more do it more often than
 
02:56:21.830 --> 02:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
once every five years um five years is
 
02:56:23.349 --> 02:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
is the de minimis
 
02:56:25.910 --> 02:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
um but um i want to say concord where we
 
02:56:28.950 --> 02:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
are here um does a frequent reassessment
 
02:56:32.230 --> 02:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
um and for a variety of reasons um and
 
02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:33.190 align:start position:0%
um and for a variety of reasons um and
and

02:56:33.190 --> 02:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:56:35.349 --> 02:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
restoring assessments to full and true
 
02:56:36.790 --> 02:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
market value
 
02:56:38.630 --> 02:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
i know when the i know when the market's
 
02:56:40.710 --> 02:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
going to tank in hudson right it's the
 
02:56:42.389 --> 02:56:42.399 align:start position:0%
day after we sent out notices of new
 
02:56:43.750 --> 02:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
value this summer
 
02:56:45.910 --> 02:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
um and i have testified in front of my
 
02:56:47.830 --> 02:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen that um well we do
 
02:56:49.990 --> 02:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
have a capital reserve account um please
 
02:56:52.070 --> 02:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
can you up it a little bit to put money
 
02:56:54.469 --> 02:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
in there and i gave that exact scenario
 
02:56:55.830 --> 02:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think you want to wait until
 
02:56:55.840 --> 02:56:57.429 align:start position:0%
i don't think you want to wait until
2027

02:56:57.429 --> 02:56:57.439 align:start position:0%
2027
 
02:57:00.389 --> 02:57:00.399 align:start position:0%
in hudson if the market goes south and
 
02:57:03.190 --> 02:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
um and we could go south equitably right
 
02:57:05.670 --> 02:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
a dispersion could be nice and tight 10
 
02:57:06.790 --> 02:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
or less
 
02:57:09.269 --> 02:57:09.279 align:start position:0%
but we could be at 130 percent of market
 
02:57:09.279 --> 02:57:10.389 align:start position:0%
but we could be at 130 percent of market
value

02:57:10.389 --> 02:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
value
 
02:57:11.990 --> 02:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's no different than being a 70 of
 
02:57:14.230 --> 02:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
market value but if you tell somebody
 
02:57:16.150 --> 02:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
you're assessing them above 100 of
 
02:57:19.030 --> 02:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
market value um you you are you are not
 
02:57:21.750 --> 02:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
looked at as uh very kindly
 
02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:23.429 align:start position:0%
looked at as uh very kindly
representative

02:57:23.429 --> 02:57:23.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:57:25.750 --> 02:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr mishap
 
02:57:29.030 --> 02:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and your patience um
 
02:57:29.040 --> 02:57:29.750 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and your patience um
so

02:57:29.750 --> 02:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:57:31.269 --> 02:57:31.279 align:start position:0%
would you believe that
 
02:57:31.279 --> 02:57:32.150 align:start position:0%
would you believe that
the

02:57:32.150 --> 02:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:57:34.469 --> 02:57:34.479 align:start position:0%
real estate market you know the
 
02:57:34.479 --> 02:57:35.990 align:start position:0%
real estate market you know the
assessment

02:57:35.990 --> 02:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:57:39.269 --> 02:57:39.279 align:start position:0%
follows the ups and downs of the peak
 
02:57:41.750 --> 02:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
and ebb of the real estate market
 
02:57:44.550 --> 02:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
correct so it's always difficult to
 
02:57:46.309 --> 02:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
catch up
 
02:57:48.389 --> 02:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
you know when it's low nobody's going to
 
02:57:51.349 --> 02:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
come back and say you know my assessment
 
02:57:53.670 --> 02:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
my value house of value has gone up so
 
02:57:56.230 --> 02:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
i'll pay more taxes but when it goes up
 
02:57:58.870 --> 02:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
taxes go up that's when we so would you
 
02:58:01.429 --> 02:58:01.439 align:start position:0%
believe that it is
 
02:58:03.750 --> 02:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
the five-year framework
 
02:58:06.070 --> 02:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
is to give that
 
02:58:07.910 --> 02:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
cushion and the
 
02:58:10.389 --> 02:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
option for people to
 
02:58:13.910 --> 02:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
say if my home is assessed too high
 
02:58:16.830 --> 02:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
i have avenues
 
02:58:21.710 --> 02:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
today to uh ask for a reassessment or
 
02:58:21.720 --> 02:58:23.590 align:start position:0%
today to uh ask for a reassessment or
reconsideration

02:58:23.590 --> 02:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
reconsideration
 
02:58:24.550 --> 02:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:58:26.150 --> 02:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative so
 
02:58:28.630 --> 02:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
um if if i feel my individual assessment
 
02:58:30.070 --> 02:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
is incorrect whether it's in the year of
 
02:58:31.590 --> 02:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
reassessment or in any other year in
 
02:58:31.600 --> 02:58:32.389 align:start position:0%
reassessment or in any other year in
between

02:58:32.389 --> 02:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:58:35.349 --> 02:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
um i have it's rsa 7616. i have an
 
02:58:37.429 --> 02:58:37.439 align:start position:0%
abatement process that i can file for
 
02:58:39.510 --> 02:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
tax abatement and then if i don't like
 
02:58:41.590 --> 02:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
what the community's said about that
 
02:58:43.670 --> 02:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
i can pursue it to the next level vortex
 
02:58:45.990 --> 02:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to feel superior court
 
02:58:49.110 --> 02:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
a reassessment of the community is more
 
02:58:49.120 --> 02:58:49.910 align:start position:0%
a reassessment of the community is more
like

02:58:49.910 --> 02:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:58:52.550 --> 02:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
me and the folks in my condo complex
 
02:58:55.030 --> 02:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
took a look at all the condos and
 
02:58:56.870 --> 02:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
we found that that strata was pretty out
 
02:58:58.389 --> 02:58:58.399 align:start position:0%
of whack
 
02:59:00.710 --> 02:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
using statistical measurements um i
 
02:59:02.469 --> 02:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
could go to the community
 
02:59:04.230 --> 02:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
all the things that catherine had uh
 
02:59:06.150 --> 02:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
discussed i go to the community and ask
 
02:59:07.750 --> 02:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
them to do it i could do a petition in
 
02:59:09.830 --> 02:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
local residence to do it
 
02:59:11.910 --> 02:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
the more likely route
 
02:59:14.150 --> 02:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
my dad did this in the early 90s before
 
02:59:15.750 --> 02:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
i was in the business
 
02:59:17.830 --> 02:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
is you petition the btla you do your
 
02:59:19.590 --> 02:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
assessment ratio study you run your
 
02:59:22.630 --> 02:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
stats and um you get the community
 
02:59:24.469 --> 02:59:24.479 align:start position:0%
either forced to do it or the community
 
02:59:26.070 --> 02:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
goes up to btla and says my goodness
 
02:59:28.630 --> 02:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
they're right um and and then the btla
 
02:59:30.389 --> 02:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
will will assume
 
02:59:32.469 --> 02:59:32.479 align:start position:0%
ownership of the rebound they'll monitor
 
02:59:34.230 --> 02:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
it and they'll make sure benchmarks are
 
02:59:36.309 --> 02:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
met um this is being done in a couple of
 
02:59:38.230 --> 02:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
city a couple of communities
 
02:59:41.110 --> 02:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
currently um but it's not the norm um
 
02:59:44.230 --> 02:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
because because communities 175 seems to
 
02:59:44.240 --> 02:59:45.030 align:start position:0%
because because communities 175 seems to
work

02:59:45.030 --> 02:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:59:47.750 --> 02:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
and it's not cheap um you know hudson we
 
02:59:49.910 --> 02:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
were able to get our
 
02:59:51.750 --> 02:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
statistical update it's a reassessment
 
02:59:53.190 --> 02:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
of property without
 
02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
hitting every house physically we've
 
02:59:56.630 --> 02:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
already done that
 
02:59:58.630 --> 02:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
but we were in this 15 to 20 dollar
 
03:00:02.070 --> 03:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
range and we have 10 000 parcels
 
03:00:03.990 --> 03:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
so a full reevaluation is going to be
 
03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
north of 15 to 20
 
03:00:07.910 --> 03:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
and it's all dependent upon
 
03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
workers labor what's the market like
 
03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:12.950 align:start position:0%
workers labor what's the market like
and

03:00:12.950 --> 03:00:12.960 align:start position:0%

delegation
 
04:07:18.229 --> 04:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
we i've had passed out to you
 
04:07:20.309 --> 04:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
the in the copies of the enabling
 
04:07:20.319 --> 04:07:21.590 align:start position:0%
the in the copies of the enabling
legislation

04:07:21.590 --> 04:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:07:23.590 --> 04:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
as previously amended for gun stock
 
04:07:23.600 --> 04:07:24.710 align:start position:0%
as previously amended for gun stock
because

04:07:24.710 --> 04:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:07:26.870 --> 04:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's somewhat obscure and hard to find
 
04:07:28.389 --> 04:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
on the websites
 
04:07:30.790 --> 04:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
because it was never folded into the
 
04:07:33.670 --> 04:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
rsas there were session laws that just
 
04:07:35.349 --> 04:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
sort of stood alone and never folded
 
04:07:36.870 --> 04:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
into our says
 
04:07:37.990 --> 04:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
04:07:39.910 --> 04:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
after the colored separator
 
04:07:41.910 --> 04:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
there is a copy of the last financial
 
04:07:43.429 --> 04:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
statement from the gunstock area
 
04:07:43.439 --> 04:07:44.630 align:start position:0%
statement from the gunstock area
commission

04:07:44.630 --> 04:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:07:46.469 --> 04:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
and that's sometimes a little bit more
 
04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
hard to find not as hard to find as the
 
04:07:48.840 --> 04:07:50.710 align:start position:0%
hard to find not as hard to find as the
legislation

04:07:50.710 --> 04:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:07:53.189 --> 04:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
the reason i'm here is that
 
04:07:55.990 --> 04:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
we and reason i introduced this bill
 
04:07:57.510 --> 04:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:07:58.790 --> 04:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
the executive committee of the
 
04:07:58.800 --> 04:08:00.070 align:start position:0%
the executive committee of the
delegation

04:08:00.070 --> 04:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
04:08:02.070 --> 04:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
has just concluded
 
04:08:05.110 --> 04:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
many days and many hours of examination
 
04:08:07.590 --> 04:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
of the proposed budget for belknap
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
county as proposed by the county
 
04:08:09.600 --> 04:08:11.030 align:start position:0%
county as proposed by the county
commissioners

04:08:11.030 --> 04:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
04:08:13.590 --> 04:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
we have made adjustments to a variety of
 
04:08:14.950 --> 04:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
line items
 
04:08:16.950 --> 04:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
and are going to forward our
 
04:08:19.830 --> 04:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the full delegation
 
04:08:22.469 --> 04:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
for a vote to adopt a budget i suspect
 
04:08:23.910 --> 04:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
there may be a few
 
04:08:26.389 --> 04:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
minor adjustments made at the delegation
 
04:08:28.149 --> 04:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
full delegation level
 
04:08:30.630 --> 04:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
but most of the adjustments were made at
 
04:08:34.309 --> 04:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
the executive committee level
 
04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
the the one page loose leaf the loose
 
04:08:40.229 --> 04:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
page that i've circulated shows the
 
04:08:44.790 --> 04:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
17 areas of county operations budget of
 
04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
departments and functional areas
 
04:08:49.110 --> 04:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
what their annual expenditures were and
 
04:08:51.750 --> 04:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
how many general ledger line items
 
04:08:53.670 --> 04:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
were reviewed in the budget review
 
04:08:56.389 --> 04:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
process by the executive committee
 
04:08:58.469 --> 04:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
you will see that the largest number was
 
04:09:01.510 --> 04:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
in the nursing home that had 11.5
 
04:09:03.750 --> 04:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars in expenditures and we
 
04:09:05.990 --> 04:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
reviewed 165
 
04:09:08.149 --> 04:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
separate line items
 
04:09:10.550 --> 04:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
over several days i might add
 
04:09:13.269 --> 04:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
in each of these departments
 
04:09:15.510 --> 04:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
we don't purport to be experts in
 
04:09:17.110 --> 04:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
04:09:19.510 --> 04:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
or sheriff's departments or corrections
 
04:09:19.520 --> 04:09:20.790 align:start position:0%
or sheriff's departments or corrections
departments

04:09:20.790 --> 04:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
departments
 
04:09:22.710 --> 04:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
but we ask that the heads of these
 
04:09:24.309 --> 04:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
departments come there
 
04:09:25.830 --> 04:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
tell us about
 
04:09:28.229 --> 04:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
their departments what they're doing and
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
why they're asking for the money that
 
04:09:32.309 --> 04:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
they're asking for
 
04:09:34.229 --> 04:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
to give you an example the sheriff's
 
04:09:34.239 --> 04:09:35.510 align:start position:0%
to give you an example the sheriff's
department

04:09:35.510 --> 04:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:09:37.189 --> 04:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
budget request was a half a million
 
04:09:39.429 --> 04:09:39.439 align:start position:0%
dollars more than the prior year
 
04:09:42.469 --> 04:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
and he wanted three new cruisers and in
 
04:09:44.070 --> 04:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
the course of the
 
04:09:46.710 --> 04:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
evaluation by the executive committee
 
04:09:48.550 --> 04:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
we basically adjusted it so that he'll
 
04:09:50.870 --> 04:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
get one new cruiser instead of three new
 
04:09:50.880 --> 04:09:52.229 align:start position:0%
get one new cruiser instead of three new
cruisers

04:09:52.229 --> 04:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
cruisers
 
04:09:52.239 --> 04:09:53.189 align:start position:0%
cruisers
um

04:09:53.189 --> 04:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:55.269 --> 04:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
that goes throughout you know throughout
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
the all the different departments
 
04:10:00.070 --> 04:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
you will see that the gunstock area
 
04:10:01.990 --> 04:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
commission based on their lace financial
 
04:10:02.000 --> 04:10:03.030 align:start position:0%
commission based on their lace financial
statement

04:10:03.030 --> 04:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
statement
 
04:10:05.349 --> 04:10:05.359 align:start position:0%
had expenditures of
 
04:10:07.429 --> 04:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
about over a hundred thousand dollars
 
04:10:09.670 --> 04:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
more than the nursing home which was the
 
04:10:12.630 --> 04:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
largest expenditure in the county
 
04:10:12.640 --> 04:10:13.590 align:start position:0%
largest expenditure in the county
and

04:10:13.590 --> 04:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:10:15.189 --> 04:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
the number of line items for the gun
 
04:10:16.870 --> 04:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
stock area commission that were reviewed
 
04:10:16.880 --> 04:10:17.670 align:start position:0%
stock area commission that were reviewed
by

04:10:17.670 --> 04:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:10:19.189 --> 04:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
the delegation or its executive
 
04:10:19.199 --> 04:10:20.229 align:start position:0%
the delegation or its executive
committee

04:10:20.229 --> 04:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:10:22.229 --> 04:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
was exactly zero
 
04:10:24.389 --> 04:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
because under the present law and the
 
04:10:26.469 --> 04:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
enabling statute
 
04:10:28.710 --> 04:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
gun stock area commission is governed by
 
04:10:30.389 --> 04:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
a five-member commission appointed by
 
04:10:32.149 --> 04:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
the delegation
 
04:10:35.670 --> 04:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
right now is there is a vacancy it's
 
04:10:38.469 --> 04:10:38.479 align:start position:0%
basically deadlock two to two there's a
 
04:10:40.469 --> 04:10:40.479 align:start position:0%
meeting tonight to appoint
 
04:10:43.590 --> 04:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
a person to fill that vacancy
 
04:10:46.149 --> 04:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
but right as it stands now the existing
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
legislation gun stock
 
04:10:51.510 --> 04:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
with this huge amount of expenditures
 
04:10:53.750 --> 04:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
sets its own budget in its own way and
 
04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
makes its own expenditures in its own
 
04:10:55.680 --> 04:10:56.469 align:start position:0%
makes its own expenditures in its own
way

04:10:56.469 --> 04:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:10:57.830 --> 04:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
without any
 
04:11:00.149 --> 04:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
input from the delegation
 
04:11:01.830 --> 04:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
and without any approval by the
 
04:11:03.110 --> 04:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
delegation or any review by the
 
04:11:03.120 --> 04:11:04.790 align:start position:0%
delegation or any review by the
delegation

04:11:04.790 --> 04:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
04:11:07.670 --> 04:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
so we get we get some anomalies
 
04:11:10.389 --> 04:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
now you're going to hear from
 
04:11:11.670 --> 04:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
some folks
 
04:11:13.349 --> 04:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
in opposition
 
04:11:15.590 --> 04:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
and what's been interesting is in this
 
04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
particular issue
 
04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
between this legislation and the feeling
 
04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
of this vacancy
 
04:11:24.550 --> 04:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
several members of the executive
 
04:11:26.630 --> 04:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
committee of the delegation
 
04:11:30.790 --> 04:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
have been subjected to a well-financed
 
04:11:30.800 --> 04:11:32.630 align:start position:0%
have been subjected to a well-financed
vituprative

04:11:32.630 --> 04:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
vituprative
 
04:11:34.469 --> 04:11:34.479 align:start position:0%
campaign of public
 
04:11:37.110 --> 04:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
public letters public advertisements
 
04:11:39.670 --> 04:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
personal attacks and lies
 
04:11:41.429 --> 04:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
all in an effort to
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
leave gun stock alone and let them do
 
04:11:46.389 --> 04:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
their thing because they had a good year
 
04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
this past year
 
04:11:50.070 --> 04:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
and they would like to think that the
 
04:11:51.750 --> 04:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
reason they had a good year was because
 
04:11:54.149 --> 04:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
of their managerial expertise
 
04:11:55.750 --> 04:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
when in reality the reason they had a
 
04:11:57.990 --> 04:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
good year was because of covet limiting
 
04:12:00.469 --> 04:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
people from going to more distant places
 
04:12:02.790 --> 04:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
for skiing and because the ski weather
 
04:12:04.070 --> 04:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
was good
 
04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
and when one of those things doesn't
 
04:12:07.670 --> 04:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
occur when the ski weather when the snow
 
04:12:09.910 --> 04:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
weather is bad as it has been in the
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
past sometimes
 
04:12:13.590 --> 04:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
they don't do as well and a few years
 
04:12:13.600 --> 04:12:14.870 align:start position:0%
they don't do as well and a few years
ago

04:12:14.870 --> 04:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
ago
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
after having a season or two of bad snow
 
04:12:19.910 --> 04:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
they actually couldn't pay their bills
 
04:12:22.630 --> 04:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
and had to turn over some of their bonds
 
04:12:24.469 --> 04:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
that they were paying directly
 
04:12:27.030 --> 04:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
to the delegation to pay out of county
 
04:12:27.040 --> 04:12:28.389 align:start position:0%
to the delegation to pay out of county
funds

04:12:28.389 --> 04:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:12:31.510 --> 04:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
gun stock is a county-owned property
 
04:12:34.389 --> 04:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
the money in the gun stock treasury is
 
04:12:36.469 --> 04:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money
 
04:12:38.790 --> 04:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
there is in my view and the view of my
 
04:12:41.590 --> 04:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors and other other supporters
 
04:12:44.149 --> 04:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
no reason why
 
04:12:46.630 --> 04:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
this their budget process
 
04:12:48.550 --> 04:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
should not be subject to the same review
 
04:12:51.349 --> 04:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
and approval of all other areas of the
 
04:12:53.670 --> 04:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
county especially considering
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
the size of the dollars involved
 
04:12:58.560 --> 04:13:01.670 align:start position:0%
the size of the dollars involved
so

04:13:01.670 --> 04:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:03.590 --> 04:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
they basically have had no public
 
04:13:03.600 --> 04:13:04.630 align:start position:0%
they basically have had no public
budgeting

04:13:04.630 --> 04:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
budgeting
 
04:13:07.030 --> 04:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
no oversight or transparency with the
 
04:13:07.040 --> 04:13:08.389 align:start position:0%
no oversight or transparency with the
delegation

04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
04:13:10.469 --> 04:13:10.479 align:start position:0%
if you carefully read this
 
04:13:10.479 --> 04:13:11.750 align:start position:0%
if you carefully read this
obscure

04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
obscure
 
04:13:14.630 --> 04:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
enabling statute as amended
 
04:13:16.389 --> 04:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
they don't have any borrowing power
 
04:13:18.389 --> 04:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
themselves the gun stock area commission
 
04:13:20.790 --> 04:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
has to get borrowing authority from the
 
04:13:20.800 --> 04:13:22.149 align:start position:0%
has to get borrowing authority from the
delegation

04:13:22.149 --> 04:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
and that whether it's a
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
revenue anticipation note
 
04:13:29.429 --> 04:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
or a bond it has to be approved by a
 
04:13:31.750 --> 04:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
super majority of the delegation
 
04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
so there are bonds that are shown as
 
04:13:35.269 --> 04:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
outstanding on the financial statement
 
04:13:37.110 --> 04:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
of gun stock but they really are
 
04:13:39.590 --> 04:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
obligations full faith and credit of the
 
04:13:42.469 --> 04:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of belknap county
 
04:13:42.479 --> 04:13:45.750 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of belknap county
so

04:13:45.750 --> 04:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:48.790 --> 04:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
why would we why do people oppose this
 
04:13:50.149 --> 04:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:13:52.950 --> 04:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
the only reason that i can fathom is
 
04:13:54.950 --> 04:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
they say we've had a good year
 
04:13:57.030 --> 04:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
the management is great just leave us
 
04:13:59.110 --> 04:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
alone and let us do our things
 
04:14:00.950 --> 04:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
but what happens when it's not such a
 
04:14:02.070 --> 04:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
good year
 
04:14:04.070 --> 04:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
and if you look at you know their
 
04:14:06.630 --> 04:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
questions for example if their budget
 
04:14:09.189 --> 04:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
had been subject to review by the
 
04:14:12.630 --> 04:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
delegation if you look in the footnotes
 
04:14:14.710 --> 04:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
to the financial statements
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
you will see that there are three bond
 
04:14:18.870 --> 04:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
issues outstanding
 
04:14:21.110 --> 04:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
at various
 
04:14:21.120 --> 04:14:21.750 align:start position:0%
at various
two interest rates

04:14:21.750 --> 04:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
two interest rates
 
04:14:23.590 --> 04:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
four five percent two point seven eight
 
04:14:23.600 --> 04:14:24.550 align:start position:0%
four five percent two point seven eight
percent

04:14:24.550 --> 04:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:14:26.070 --> 04:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
three point five to four point three
 
04:14:28.550 --> 04:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
percent but then if you look at the next
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
page which is page ten of the financials
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
you will see their capital leases and
 
04:14:35.830 --> 04:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
capital leases are nothing more than a
 
04:14:38.070 --> 04:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
substitute a way of borrowing
 
04:14:39.750 --> 04:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
so you see that they have a bunch of
 
04:14:42.469 --> 04:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
capital leases at varying interest rates
 
04:14:42.479 --> 04:14:43.590 align:start position:0%
capital leases at varying interest rates
including

04:14:43.590 --> 04:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
including
 
04:14:45.349 --> 04:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
a 402
 
04:14:47.830 --> 04:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
300 equipment lease
 
04:14:50.790 --> 04:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
with interest at 11.8
 
04:14:50.800 --> 04:14:52.950 align:start position:0%
with interest at 11.8
percent

04:14:52.950 --> 04:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:14:54.870 --> 04:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
why a capital lease
 
04:14:57.269 --> 04:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
and why not a bond
 
04:14:59.189 --> 04:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
my answer is very simple if they had
 
04:15:01.110 --> 04:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
asked for a bond for this they would
 
04:15:02.469 --> 04:15:02.479 align:start position:0%
have had to make their presentation to
 
04:15:04.149 --> 04:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
the delegation and they would have had
 
04:15:05.510 --> 04:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
to have gotten approval from the
 
04:15:07.670 --> 04:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
delegation so instead they went around
 
04:15:09.030 --> 04:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
the delegation
 
04:15:11.670 --> 04:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
signed a capital lease at almost 12
 
04:15:15.030 --> 04:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:17.429 --> 04:15:17.439 align:start position:0%
another example of
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
what we consider to be
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
just outrageous problems with the
 
04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
finances at gun stock
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
is at the end of june or i'm sorry april
 
04:15:29.110 --> 04:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
30th they had over six million dollars
 
04:15:32.070 --> 04:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
in cash and current assets on hand after
 
04:15:32.080 --> 04:15:33.110 align:start position:0%
in cash and current assets on hand after
the

04:15:33.110 --> 04:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:15:35.349 --> 04:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
ski season
 
04:15:36.710 --> 04:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
in august
 
04:15:39.269 --> 04:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
without a public hearing to discuss
 
04:15:39.279 --> 04:15:41.189 align:start position:0%
without a public hearing to discuss
bonuses

04:15:41.189 --> 04:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
bonuses
 
04:15:43.510 --> 04:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
they paid bonuses over a hundred
 
04:15:45.030 --> 04:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:15:47.110 --> 04:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
in cash bonuses
 
04:15:49.110 --> 04:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
to some favored top people not the
 
04:15:51.110 --> 04:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
people that are on the ski lifts
 
04:15:52.389 --> 04:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
not the people that do the ski
 
04:15:55.030 --> 04:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
instruction but top management
 
04:15:57.030 --> 04:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
so we have a situation in which we have
 
04:15:58.630 --> 04:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
a general manager
 
04:16:01.269 --> 04:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
under contract with an annual base of a
 
04:16:02.790 --> 04:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
hundred eighty four thousand dollars
 
04:16:04.469 --> 04:16:04.479 align:start position:0%
plus benefits
 
04:16:06.550 --> 04:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
and he got a forty thousand dollar cash
 
04:16:06.560 --> 04:16:07.910 align:start position:0%
and he got a forty thousand dollar cash
bonus

04:16:07.910 --> 04:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
bonus
 
04:16:10.070 --> 04:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
even without the cash bonus
 
04:16:13.750 --> 04:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
he makes more than governor sununu
 
04:16:16.389 --> 04:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
this is for running a ski resort in the
 
04:16:19.110 --> 04:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
little town of guilford
 
04:16:19.120 --> 04:16:19.830 align:start position:0%
little town of guilford
so

04:16:19.830 --> 04:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:16:22.389 --> 04:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
what we're asking what my bill is asking
 
04:16:24.149 --> 04:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
for and the sponsors
 
04:16:26.070 --> 04:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
who are basically all from belknap
 
04:16:26.080 --> 04:16:27.670 align:start position:0%
who are basically all from belknap
county

04:16:27.670 --> 04:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
county
 
04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
is that we
 
04:16:32.389 --> 04:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
bring the gun stock budgeting process
 
04:16:33.750 --> 04:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
into the same
 
04:16:37.269 --> 04:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
controls and transparency that all other
 
04:16:40.149 --> 04:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
aspects of county budgeting
 
04:16:40.159 --> 04:16:41.590 align:start position:0%
aspects of county budgeting
experience

04:16:41.590 --> 04:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
experience
 
04:16:44.309 --> 04:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
representative howard who is the chair
 
04:16:45.590 --> 04:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
of the executive committee is here to
 
04:16:45.600 --> 04:16:46.790 align:start position:0%
of the executive committee is here to
testify

04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
testify
 
04:16:49.030 --> 04:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
he was the principal author of the last
 
04:16:52.469 --> 04:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
amendment to the enabling legislation
 
04:16:55.510 --> 04:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
he and i have discussed the bill and we
 
04:16:57.349 --> 04:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
will probably be submitting an amendment
 
04:16:59.269 --> 04:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
in a few days as soon as we can get
 
04:17:01.349 --> 04:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
something out of ols
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
making a few minor technical corrections
 
04:17:06.630 --> 04:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
but as it stands the bill the basic guts
 
04:17:09.670 --> 04:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
of the bill will be the same which is
 
04:17:13.110 --> 04:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
we want oversight by the delegation
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
there's an 18-member delegation elected
 
04:17:18.149 --> 04:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
by the people the five-member
 
04:17:20.309 --> 04:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
gun stock area commission is not elected
 
04:17:22.309 --> 04:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
by the people they have terms longer
 
04:17:24.550 --> 04:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
than two years they have five year terms
 
04:17:27.189 --> 04:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
there is no accountability at present
 
04:17:40.070 --> 04:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:41.590 --> 04:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:17:43.590 --> 04:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:17:46.309 --> 04:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
how are the gun stock commissioners um
 
04:17:49.269 --> 04:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
appointed five-year terms oh but house
 
04:17:50.630 --> 04:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
they're staggered they're appointed by
 
04:17:53.429 --> 04:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
the delegation okay by a majority vote
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
of the delegation the the enabling
 
04:17:57.990 --> 04:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
statute says that the members are
 
04:18:00.070 --> 04:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
appointed are subject to removal for
 
04:18:01.990 --> 04:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
cause by the delegation
 
04:18:05.030 --> 04:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you follow-up okay
 
04:18:06.389 --> 04:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
although this is kind of a separate
 
04:18:08.389 --> 04:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
question but um
 
04:18:10.950 --> 04:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
in the financial report you cited all of
 
04:18:13.590 --> 04:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
the expenditures but i'm assuming gun
 
04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
stock gets revenue as well right oh yes
 
04:18:16.319 --> 04:18:17.189 align:start position:0%
stock gets revenue as well right oh yes
so

04:18:17.189 --> 04:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:19.110 --> 04:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
except for a bad skier they're running
 
04:18:21.189 --> 04:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
in the they run in the black this year
 
04:18:22.870 --> 04:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
they this past year they ran yes
 
04:18:24.790 --> 04:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
substantially in the black okay all
 
04:18:29.349 --> 04:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:30.710 --> 04:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:18:33.269 --> 04:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question so my understanding
 
04:18:36.309 --> 04:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
that with under the
 
04:18:38.389 --> 04:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
governance of the
 
04:18:38.399 --> 04:18:39.429 align:start position:0%
governance of the
any

04:18:39.429 --> 04:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:18:42.229 --> 04:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
county government you have governmental
 
04:18:45.030 --> 04:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
activities and component units so my
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is that gun stock
 
04:18:51.030 --> 04:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
ski area is a component unit are there
 
04:18:53.670 --> 04:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
any other component units in beltmap
 
04:18:53.680 --> 04:18:55.670 align:start position:0%
any other component units in beltmap
county

04:18:55.670 --> 04:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
county
 
04:18:57.510 --> 04:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that other than
 
04:18:58.950 --> 04:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
the 16
 
04:19:00.550 --> 04:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
departments and functional areas i
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
listed on the one pager
 
04:19:05.590 --> 04:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
and gun stock there are no other
 
04:19:05.600 --> 04:19:06.550 align:start position:0%
and gun stock there are no other
county

04:19:06.550 --> 04:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
county
 
04:19:09.910 --> 04:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
um county operations that where the
 
04:19:11.189 --> 04:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
county where the budget is either
 
04:19:13.510 --> 04:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
determined by the gun stock delegate or
 
04:19:16.389 --> 04:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
the belknap delegation or by some other
 
04:19:18.149 --> 04:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
process like in this case by the gun
 
04:19:19.750 --> 04:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
security commission i'm not i don't i'm
 
04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
not aware of any other areas
 
04:19:24.550 --> 04:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's the only area out of 16 areas that
 
04:19:27.269 --> 04:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
is not under uh review by the lab
 
04:19:27.279 --> 04:19:34.550 align:start position:0%
is not under uh review by the lab
delegation

04:19:34.550 --> 04:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:36.790 --> 04:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative silver for your
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh testimony um
 
04:19:43.830 --> 04:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
the are there other ski areas that are
 
04:19:45.910 --> 04:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
similar to gun stock
 
04:19:48.469 --> 04:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
04:19:50.950 --> 04:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
for instance cannon mountain
 
04:19:54.870 --> 04:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
is i believe a state ski area
 
04:19:56.830 --> 04:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
how does gun stock
 
04:19:59.510 --> 04:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
compare to
 
04:20:01.590 --> 04:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
cannon mountain and what is the
 
04:20:01.600 --> 04:20:03.750 align:start position:0%
cannon mountain and what is the
governance

04:20:03.750 --> 04:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
governance
 
04:20:06.389 --> 04:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
the government how is cannon mountain
 
04:20:06.399 --> 04:20:07.510 align:start position:0%
the government how is cannon mountain
governed

04:20:07.510 --> 04:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
governed
 
04:20:10.229 --> 04:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
as compared to gun stock
 
04:20:11.189 --> 04:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
04:20:12.870 --> 04:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
question i don't have an answer for you
 
04:20:15.189 --> 04:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
because i don't have any statistics or
 
04:20:17.429 --> 04:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
any research on those other areas the
 
04:20:20.229 --> 04:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
only other ski area about which i have
 
04:20:21.670 --> 04:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
some information
 
04:20:24.550 --> 04:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
is like is the sunapee ski area which is
 
04:20:26.710 --> 04:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
state-owned a state-owned property and
 
04:20:28.389 --> 04:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
was operated by the state for a number
 
04:20:31.910 --> 04:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
of years and ultimately was leased
 
04:20:33.830 --> 04:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
and when it was leased
 
04:20:36.070 --> 04:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
the operators then had to pay full real
 
04:20:38.710 --> 04:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
estate taxes as opposed to being exempt
 
04:20:41.510 --> 04:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
if you look carefully in the
 
04:20:43.830 --> 04:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
in the enabling statute
 
04:20:46.070 --> 04:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
it provides that
 
04:20:46.080 --> 04:20:46.870 align:start position:0%
it provides that
the

04:20:46.870 --> 04:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:49.349 --> 04:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
gun stock ski area pays real estate
 
04:20:49.359 --> 04:20:50.550 align:start position:0%
gun stock ski area pays real estate
taxes

04:20:50.550 --> 04:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
04:20:52.550 --> 04:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
of slightly less than seven thousand
 
04:20:55.349 --> 04:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
dollars a year on a property that the
 
04:20:57.429 --> 04:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
town of guilford's assessor says is
 
04:21:01.030 --> 04:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
worth in excess of 15 million dollars
 
04:21:04.309 --> 04:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
but if this were leased as sunapee is

under the i think it's like basically
 
04:22:23.189 --> 04:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
your first page it talks about

04:22:34.070 --> 04:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
dollars and did not go to commission
 
04:22:35.429 --> 04:22:35.439 align:start position:0%

correct i apologize for not asking for
 
04:22:50.630 --> 04:22:50.640 align:start position:0%

appreciate you offering all this
 
04:23:10.309 --> 04:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
information i'm curious
 
04:23:13.349 --> 04:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
does the does the belknap
 
04:23:15.590 --> 04:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
county commissioners review the audit
 
04:23:17.910 --> 04:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
every year and follow up to that would
 
04:23:17.920 --> 04:23:18.790 align:start position:0%
every year and follow up to that would
be

04:23:18.790 --> 04:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:23:21.030 --> 04:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
have there been um have there been
 
04:23:23.189 --> 04:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
deficiencies noted in the management
 
04:23:25.510 --> 04:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
letters for that for any of those audits
 
04:23:27.110 --> 04:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
i have no idea whether the county
 
04:23:29.269 --> 04:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
commission reviews the audit or not or
 
04:23:31.349 --> 04:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
whether they do any follow-up it's not
 
04:23:33.830 --> 04:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
under what i do know is it is does not
 
04:23:36.229 --> 04:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
report to the to the delegation the
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
delegation does not is not asked to
 
04:23:40.630 --> 04:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
review or comment or ask questions or
 
04:23:42.550 --> 04:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
anything about it
 
04:23:45.030 --> 04:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to emphasize you i don't
 
04:23:45.910 --> 04:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
want to
 
04:23:46.710 --> 04:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:23:48.790 --> 04:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
go beyond your question except
 
04:23:50.870 --> 04:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
this is not a partisan issue
 
04:23:52.469 --> 04:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
this is not a democrat issue or a
 
04:23:54.710 --> 04:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
republican issue this is a taxpayer
 
04:23:54.720 --> 04:23:55.510 align:start position:0%
republican issue this is a taxpayer
issue

04:23:55.510 --> 04:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:23:56.469 --> 04:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
the money
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
in the coffers at gun stock belong to
 
04:24:02.229 --> 04:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers of belmont county and if
 
04:24:04.630 --> 04:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
if they don't if they accumulate money
 
04:24:06.710 --> 04:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
and spend it on things that are not in
 
04:24:08.950 --> 04:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
the best interests of the county
 
04:24:11.910 --> 04:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that needs to stop
 
04:24:13.110 --> 04:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
they need to
 
04:24:15.590 --> 04:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps pay off the bonds early they
 
04:24:17.590 --> 04:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
need to not try to circumvent the
 
04:24:20.070 --> 04:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
bonding process by using capital leases
 
04:24:22.550 --> 04:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
if this was under the control of the
 
04:24:25.590 --> 04:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
delegation i can almost guarantee you
 
04:24:26.950 --> 04:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
that the delegation would not have
 
04:24:32.309 --> 04:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:34.710 --> 04:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any oh yes
 
04:24:34.720 --> 04:24:36.469 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any oh yes
representative

04:24:36.469 --> 04:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:24:37.830 --> 04:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question you said earlier that
 
04:24:41.990 --> 04:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
the members of the commission were
 
04:24:44.389 --> 04:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
appointed by the delegation correct is
 
04:24:46.149 --> 04:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
that correct yes and that they could be
 
04:24:48.229 --> 04:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
removed for cause yes is that correct
 
04:24:50.389 --> 04:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
correct and that implies some level of
 
04:24:52.389 --> 04:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
review by the delegation is that not
 
04:24:55.110 --> 04:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
correct that that it does
 
04:24:57.189 --> 04:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
for the delegation the authority to
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
remove for cause yes so
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
then follow up mr chair so
 
04:25:04.389 --> 04:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
if you're removing someone for cause
 
04:25:06.389 --> 04:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
then you must be reviewing that person's
 
04:25:08.229 --> 04:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
performance to determine that there's
 
04:25:09.910 --> 04:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
cause to remove them if there was a
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
preceding pending to remove someone that
 
04:25:14.790 --> 04:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
would imply yes a review of their
 
04:25:17.590 --> 04:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
performance a specification of charges
 
04:25:20.309 --> 04:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
and due process
 
04:25:23.030 --> 04:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
but you earlier said that the delegation
 
04:25:25.269 --> 04:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
does not review the commissioner's
 
04:25:28.149 --> 04:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
performance it has not yet reviewed the
 
04:25:29.910 --> 04:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
specific performance of individual
 
04:25:29.920 --> 04:25:33.830 align:start position:0%
specific performance of individual
commissioners

04:25:33.830 --> 04:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:33.840 --> 04:25:34.630 align:start position:0%
 
i

04:25:34.630 --> 04:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:25:36.790 --> 04:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
like to add one more thing and that is
 
04:25:39.349 --> 04:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
that the gunstock area commission
 
04:25:41.429 --> 04:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
several months ago actually filed a
 
04:25:41.439 --> 04:25:42.550 align:start position:0%
several months ago actually filed a
lawsuit

04:25:42.550 --> 04:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
04:25:46.070 --> 04:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
in superior court against the delegation
 
04:25:48.389 --> 04:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
seeking to enjoin the delegation
 
04:25:51.110 --> 04:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
from exercising its removal power
 
04:25:53.349 --> 04:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
set forth in the statute
 
04:25:55.670 --> 04:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
and so far there have been two
 
04:25:57.269 --> 04:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
proceedings one for a temporary
 
04:25:59.830 --> 04:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
restraining order which was denied
 
04:26:01.910 --> 04:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
one for a preliminary injunction which
 
04:26:03.510 --> 04:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
was denied
 
04:26:05.189 --> 04:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
and about an hour and a half ago the
 
04:26:06.950 --> 04:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
motion for reconsideration by the
 
04:26:09.269 --> 04:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
attorney for the gun security commission
 
04:26:11.590 --> 04:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
to reconsider the denial of the
 
04:26:13.269 --> 04:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
preliminary injunction
 
04:26:13.279 --> 04:26:14.830 align:start position:0%
preliminary injunction
was

04:26:14.830 --> 04:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:26:17.670 --> 04:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
denied and the the last order judge
 
04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%

04:27:03.670 --> 04:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
when they
 
04:27:05.429 --> 04:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
my understanding is when they have been
 
04:27:07.830 --> 04:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
in the red in the past and it has been
 
04:27:09.269 --> 04:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
sufficient that they couldn't pay their
 
04:27:11.590 --> 04:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
bills as they fall do they'll do
 
04:27:13.670 --> 04:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
that they actually
 
04:27:16.469 --> 04:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
called on the delegation and the county
 
04:27:18.790 --> 04:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
to pay their bond payments that were
 
04:27:20.229 --> 04:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
required to be paid
 
04:27:22.790 --> 04:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
when they have excess money like this
 
04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
like this past year because it was a
 
04:27:27.189 --> 04:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
good snow season and the covid
 
04:27:29.349 --> 04:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
drove up the attendance they're they're
 
04:27:31.510 --> 04:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
sitting on a lot of cash they have a lot
 
04:27:34.389 --> 04:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
of cash they actually have proposed to
 
04:27:34.399 --> 04:27:35.110 align:start position:0%
of cash they actually have proposed to
to

04:27:35.110 --> 04:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:27:37.110 --> 04:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
seek authorization for a revenue
 
04:27:39.189 --> 04:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
anticipation loan while they're sitting
 
04:27:41.269 --> 04:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
on millions of dollars of cash and i
 
04:27:42.870 --> 04:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
think they saw that the handwriting was
 
04:27:44.309 --> 04:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
on the wall they went through their
 
04:27:44.319 --> 04:27:45.590 align:start position:0%
on the wall they went through their
request

04:27:45.590 --> 04:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
request
 
04:27:47.990 --> 04:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
what they do with it is up to them
 
04:27:50.550 --> 04:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
the statute says they give a percentage
 
04:27:52.790 --> 04:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
of the gross to the county and what they
 
04:27:55.830 --> 04:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
do with the rest is strictly up to them
 
04:27:59.349 --> 04:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:01.590 --> 04:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:28:04.070 --> 04:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair just have a
 
04:28:05.670 --> 04:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
different question
 
04:28:08.070 --> 04:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my uh question
 
04:28:08.080 --> 04:28:10.229 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my uh question
representative

04:28:10.229 --> 04:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:28:10.239 --> 04:28:11.429 align:start position:0%
representative
so

04:28:11.429 --> 04:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
from your uh testimony i understand the
 
04:28:17.269 --> 04:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
delegation still has
 
04:28:17.279 --> 04:28:18.070 align:start position:0%
delegation still has
the

04:28:18.070 --> 04:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:20.710 --> 04:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
ability to appoint or remove the
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
commissioners and the delegation is
 
04:28:26.870 --> 04:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
elected by the voters correct correct so
 
04:28:29.590 --> 04:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
the delegation could change based on the
 
04:28:29.600 --> 04:28:30.790 align:start position:0%
the delegation could change based on the
elections

04:28:30.790 --> 04:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
elections
 
04:28:30.800 --> 04:28:31.590 align:start position:0%
elections
so

04:28:31.590 --> 04:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:35.110 --> 04:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
you delegation still has the ability to
 
04:28:37.670 --> 04:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
hold the commissioners
 
04:28:37.680 --> 04:28:39.830 align:start position:0%
hold the commissioners
accountable

04:28:39.830 --> 04:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
04:28:39.840 --> 04:28:40.870 align:start position:0%
accountable
for

04:28:40.870 --> 04:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:28:44.149 --> 04:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
the performance of the gun stocker
 
04:28:46.149 --> 04:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
isn't that indirectly done
 
04:28:48.229 --> 04:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
indirectly yes representative that
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
indirectly that is the case however
 
04:28:52.870 --> 04:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
every year
 
04:28:55.030 --> 04:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
the county commission submits budget
 
04:28:57.429 --> 04:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
proposals and are reviewed all these 16
 
04:28:59.429 --> 04:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
areas every year
 
04:29:03.110 --> 04:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
and we don't look to seek to remove any
 
04:29:04.790 --> 04:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
individual head of a department or
 
04:29:07.030 --> 04:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
anything like that for for overspending
 
04:29:09.670 --> 04:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
or anything like that we we do hold the
 
04:29:11.830 --> 04:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
county commissioners libel the county
 
04:29:14.389 --> 04:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
commissioners we have a transfer policy
 
04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
where the county commissioners must come
 
04:29:19.269 --> 04:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
to the delegation for authority to
 
04:29:21.429 --> 04:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
transfer between line items over a
 
04:29:23.510 --> 04:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
certain amount and that was the subject
 
04:29:26.550 --> 04:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
where the delegation actually in 2014
 
04:29:27.830 --> 04:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
had to sue
 
04:29:29.990 --> 04:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
the county commissioners and get an
 
04:29:31.429 --> 04:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
injunction against the county
 
04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
commissioners for violation
 
04:29:36.469 --> 04:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
of the transfer policy
 
04:29:38.469 --> 04:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
we have just discovered in our hearings
 
04:29:40.950 --> 04:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
in the past week or 10 days
 
04:29:42.950 --> 04:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
that they have ignored the provisions of
 
04:29:44.630 --> 04:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
that injunction
 
04:29:46.790 --> 04:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
and have overspent a line item without
 
04:29:48.389 --> 04:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
an appropriation
 
04:29:49.830 --> 04:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
which is
 
04:29:51.670 --> 04:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
in our view which is going to probably
 
04:29:53.110 --> 04:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
be referred to the attorney general's
 
04:29:55.990 --> 04:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
office and perhaps the superior court
 
04:29:58.229 --> 04:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
just to follow up to clarify i sit on
 
04:30:00.389 --> 04:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
the hillsborough county executive
 
04:30:02.630 --> 04:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
committee right as a and i'm also a
 
04:30:05.269 --> 04:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
delegate from hillsborough county so i
 
04:30:08.469 --> 04:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
understand the process of reviewing the
 
04:30:11.030 --> 04:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
budget for the different departments and
 
04:30:13.510 --> 04:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
my i'm trying to understand the
 
04:30:15.750 --> 04:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
workings of the gun stock
 
04:30:16.950 --> 04:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
and how its
 
04:30:20.070 --> 04:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
commissioners are reviewing or they are
 
04:30:22.790 --> 04:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
overseeing and the delegation has
 
04:30:24.630 --> 04:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
the authority to
 
04:30:26.790 --> 04:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
hold commissioners accountable so
 
04:30:28.870 --> 04:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
indirectly through the commissioners the
 
04:30:31.189 --> 04:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
delegation has the control over gun
 
04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
stock am i correct
 
04:30:35.429 --> 04:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
only the only control
 
04:30:36.389 --> 04:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
is the
 
04:30:38.870 --> 04:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
is the possibility of removal for cause
 
04:30:41.429 --> 04:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
that is the only control it's not any
 
04:30:42.950 --> 04:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
04:30:44.389 --> 04:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
the gun stock area commission doesn't
 
04:30:46.630 --> 04:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
report their budget to the delegation
 
04:30:48.790 --> 04:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't ask for approval doesn't answer
 
04:30:50.790 --> 04:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
questions about it it's
 
04:30:53.349 --> 04:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
it's whatever its budget is and and the
 
04:30:56.710 --> 04:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
process of removing a commissioner
 
04:30:56.720 --> 04:30:59.030 align:start position:0%
process of removing a commissioner
is

04:30:59.030 --> 04:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:31:01.750 --> 04:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
extreme it is not something it's not as
 
04:31:04.070 --> 04:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
bad it's not as difficult as impeachment
 
04:31:05.590 --> 04:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
of a state official
 
04:31:07.349 --> 04:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
but it is
 
04:31:09.110 --> 04:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's pretty it's pretty a pretty drastic
 
04:31:11.429 --> 04:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
remedy it's a pretty drastic remedy that
 
04:31:13.590 --> 04:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
is yes so in yes the answer to your
 
04:31:15.910 --> 04:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
question is yes indirectly there is some
 
04:31:17.750 --> 04:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
control by virtue of its ability to
 
04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
remove thank you
 
04:31:22.229 --> 04:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:31:25.110 --> 04:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you mr chairman
 
04:31:27.110 --> 04:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for taking my question
 
04:31:27.120 --> 04:31:28.149 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for taking my question
representative

04:31:28.149 --> 04:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:31:29.990 --> 04:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
i i just had a chance to kind of look
 
04:31:31.590 --> 04:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
this over i just got this before the
 
04:31:33.590 --> 04:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
hearing began and
 
04:31:35.349 --> 04:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
04:31:37.670 --> 04:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering about is has there been
 
04:31:40.070 --> 04:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
any market analysis
 
04:31:42.790 --> 04:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
done of gun stock to its competitors
 
04:31:44.710 --> 04:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
obviously it's competing with other ski
 
04:31:44.720 --> 04:31:45.670 align:start position:0%
obviously it's competing with other ski
areas

04:31:45.670 --> 04:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
areas
 
04:31:47.910 --> 04:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
um you know when you say it's you know
 
04:31:51.030 --> 04:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
there's 16 departments in the in the uh
 
04:31:52.790 --> 04:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
in the county but
 
04:31:55.030 --> 04:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
i think operating a ski area is going to
 
04:31:56.710 --> 04:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
be very different than operating a
 
04:31:58.229 --> 04:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
nursing home there's a lot of
 
04:31:58.239 --> 04:31:59.670 align:start position:0%
nursing home there's a lot of
competition

04:31:59.670 --> 04:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
competition
 
04:32:01.030 --> 04:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
and so i was wondering if there's ever
 
04:32:03.110 --> 04:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
been a market analysis to see if the
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
financial practices of gun stock are
 
04:32:08.710 --> 04:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
misaligned with what we might see among
 
04:32:10.710 --> 04:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
their competitors particularly when you
 
04:32:13.269 --> 04:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
mention the salary and bonuses
 
04:32:15.269 --> 04:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
is that practice consistent with other
 
04:32:17.510 --> 04:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
ski areas that gun stock is competing
 
04:32:17.520 --> 04:32:18.229 align:start position:0%
ski areas that gun stock is competing
with

04:32:18.229 --> 04:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:32:19.590 --> 04:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
i have not and i don't believe the
 
04:32:21.590 --> 04:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
delegation is currently comprised has
 
04:32:24.389 --> 04:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
seen any kind of market analysis or
 
04:32:25.750 --> 04:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
market study
 
04:32:25.760 --> 04:32:27.030 align:start position:0%
market study
however

04:32:27.030 --> 04:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:32:29.750 --> 04:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
when belnap county issues bonds it has
 
04:32:31.670 --> 04:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
to go to a rating service called moody's
 
04:32:34.070 --> 04:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
to get a rating to sell their bonds the
 
04:32:35.990 --> 04:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
last two times that
 
04:32:37.429 --> 04:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
moody's then
 
04:32:40.229 --> 04:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
issues a financial report to justify
 
04:32:42.149 --> 04:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
supposedly their ratings
 
04:32:43.910 --> 04:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
the last two
 
04:32:45.910 --> 04:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
moody's reports which are online
 
04:32:49.110 --> 04:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
available in the belknap county website
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
indicated the two major areas of
 
04:32:53.750 --> 04:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
financial concern for the health of the
 
04:32:55.349 --> 04:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
county finances
 
04:32:56.870 --> 04:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
according to moody's
 
04:32:58.950 --> 04:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
was the nursing home
 
04:33:00.630 --> 04:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
and gun stock
 
04:33:02.710 --> 04:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
but i have not seen
 
04:33:05.029 --> 04:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
gunstock has for the commissioners have
 
04:33:07.510 --> 04:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
proposed the rough outlines of a
 
04:33:09.830 --> 04:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
so-called master plan for future
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
development without any numbers without
 
04:33:14.310 --> 04:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
any you know
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
analysis or any detailed discussion
 
04:33:19.349 --> 04:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
provided to the delegation because in
 
04:33:21.510 --> 04:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
order to do any kind of master plan
 
04:33:23.109 --> 04:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
they're going to almost certainly have
 
04:33:25.109 --> 04:33:25.119 align:start position:0%
to issue bonds and they need to come to
 
04:33:26.949 --> 04:33:26.959 align:start position:0%
the delegation for that we have not seen
 
04:33:28.709 --> 04:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
any numbers we have not seen any kind of
 
04:33:30.869 --> 04:33:30.879 align:start position:0%
market study anything like that the
 
04:33:33.670 --> 04:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
answer is no all right thank you
 
04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:41.109 --> 04:33:41.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry it's davis representative
 
04:33:41.119 --> 04:33:44.470 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry it's davis representative
davis

04:33:44.470 --> 04:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:47.269 --> 04:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:33:50.070 --> 04:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh does the county delegation oversee
 
04:33:52.789 --> 04:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
the nursing home expenditures yes and
 
04:33:54.551 --> 04:33:54.561 align:start position:0%
yet they are a concern to moody's as
 
04:33:56.789 --> 04:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
well yes
 
04:33:58.470 --> 04:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
is there a reason why they are a concern
 
04:34:00.789 --> 04:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
to moody's yes because
 
04:34:01.990 --> 04:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
the cause
 
04:34:04.390 --> 04:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
of difficulty in staffing and the
 
04:34:06.150 --> 04:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
staffing difficulty
 
04:34:08.551 --> 04:34:08.561 align:start position:0%
predate covet
 
04:34:10.949 --> 04:34:10.959 align:start position:0%
they the nursing home has 90-something
 
04:34:14.230 --> 04:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
beds there's 60-something beds presently
 
04:34:16.150 --> 04:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
occupied because they can't get enough
 
04:34:17.830 --> 04:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
staff and they've got a waiting list of
 
04:34:19.510 --> 04:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
people if they had the staff
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
and if the cms the federal cms
 
04:34:24.949 --> 04:34:24.959 align:start position:0%
rules go into effect requiring the
 
04:34:27.670 --> 04:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
nurses and all the staff on the site to
 
04:34:29.990 --> 04:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
be fully vaccinated
 
04:34:30.000 --> 04:34:31.029 align:start position:0%
be fully vaccinated
there

04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:34:32.310 --> 04:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
according to the nursing home
 
04:34:34.629 --> 04:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
administrator testifying last week to
 
04:34:36.230 --> 04:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
the delegation
 
04:34:38.551 --> 04:34:38.561 align:start position:0%
they would have enough people to staff
 
04:34:40.869 --> 04:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
16 beds
 
04:34:43.590 --> 04:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
out of a 90 plus follow up mr chair yes
 
04:34:47.510 --> 04:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:49.510 --> 04:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
why has the delegation allowed the
 
04:34:51.029 --> 04:34:51.039 align:start position:0%
nursing home to come
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
to be continuing cause of concern for
 
04:34:53.760 --> 04:34:56.629 align:start position:0%
to be continuing cause of concern for
moody's

04:34:56.629 --> 04:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:56.639 --> 04:34:57.510 align:start position:0%
 
we

04:34:57.510 --> 04:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:34:59.510 --> 04:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
keep asking questions of the nursing
 
04:35:01.429 --> 04:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
home administrator
 
04:35:04.150 --> 04:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:07.590 --> 04:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
and basically everything we're told is
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
we've got mandates from the federal
 
04:35:10.949 --> 04:35:10.959 align:start position:0%
government we've got mandates from the
 
04:35:13.109 --> 04:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
state government we've got this mandate
 
04:35:15.349 --> 04:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
and this regulation and that regulation
 
04:35:18.869 --> 04:35:18.879 align:start position:0%
and we simply do not get enough money to
 
04:35:20.789 --> 04:35:20.799 align:start position:0%
run the nursing home when i was on the
 
04:35:23.269 --> 04:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
delegation in 2017
 
04:35:25.429 --> 04:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
and going through the budget process i
 
04:35:26.869 --> 04:35:26.879 align:start position:0%
asked the nursing uh the nursing
 
04:35:28.789 --> 04:35:28.799 align:start position:0%
administrator how much and the county
 
04:35:30.869 --> 04:35:30.879 align:start position:0%
administrator how much out of pocket
 
04:35:33.109 --> 04:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
does belknap county taxpayers go
 
04:35:35.590 --> 04:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
after you pull in the medicare medicaid
 
04:35:37.429 --> 04:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
private pay and all that stuff what's
 
04:35:39.910 --> 04:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
the net out of pocket to
 
04:35:39.920 --> 04:35:40.629 align:start position:0%
the net out of pocket to
that

04:35:40.629 --> 04:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
belknap county taxpayers have to pay in
 
04:35:46.551 --> 04:35:46.561 align:start position:0%
2017 it was 500 000
 
04:35:50.629 --> 04:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
this year it's over a million dollars
 
04:35:52.709 --> 04:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates change
 
04:35:52.719 --> 04:35:55.109 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates change
um

04:35:55.109 --> 04:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:56.470 --> 04:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know all
 
04:35:57.510 --> 04:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
there have been there have been all
 
04:36:00.070 --> 04:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
sorts of answers proposals things like
 
04:36:00.080 --> 04:36:00.869 align:start position:0%
sorts of answers proposals things like
that

04:36:00.869 --> 04:36:00.879 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:36:02.470 --> 04:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
i don't have the easy answer to the
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
nursing home problem
 
04:36:06.949 --> 04:36:06.959 align:start position:0%
i don't know that anybody does okay i'm
 
04:36:09.269 --> 04:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
going to go now oh representative
 
04:36:11.429 --> 04:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
right after you uh
 
04:36:13.510 --> 04:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
jim i'm going to go to the audience for
 
04:36:15.029 --> 04:36:15.039 align:start position:0%
some input
 
04:36:16.709 --> 04:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:36:17.910 --> 04:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
taking another question i'll go as
 
04:36:19.910 --> 04:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
quickly as i can i'm reading through
 
04:36:22.230 --> 04:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
this quickly and i see in your bill
 
04:36:26.789 --> 04:36:26.799 align:start position:0%
the the attempt to uh amend 399.14 and i
 
04:36:28.869 --> 04:36:28.879 align:start position:0%
looked real quickly at the other bills
 
04:36:32.390 --> 04:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
which went to 399.14 and 399.15
 
04:36:35.590 --> 04:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
but i'm looking at 399.17
 
04:36:37.830 --> 04:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
and i'll read real quickly it says i'm
 
04:36:40.470 --> 04:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
summarizing the billnap cap belknap
 
04:36:42.230 --> 04:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
county commissioner shall be relieved of
 
04:36:44.150 --> 04:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
all duties and responsibilities with
 
04:36:45.910 --> 04:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
respect to the operation and maintenance
 
04:36:48.470 --> 04:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
of this area i'm just curious why that
 
04:36:50.070 --> 04:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
piece wasn't
 
04:36:52.390 --> 04:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
considered to be struck or amended
 
04:36:54.310 --> 04:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me that with that
 
04:36:57.670 --> 04:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
remaining that this would be in conflict
 
04:36:59.830 --> 04:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
am i missing something i don't believe
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
that the county commissioners since we
 
04:37:03.269 --> 04:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
basically if we put the county
 
04:37:05.109 --> 04:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
commissioners take that out put the
 
04:37:07.109 --> 04:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
county commissioners over
 
04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
the gun stock area delegation or the gun
 
04:37:10.551 --> 04:37:10.561 align:start position:0%
security commission
 
04:37:12.709 --> 04:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
you basically have duplicated two
 
04:37:15.510 --> 04:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
supervisory jurisdictions where all
 
04:37:17.510 --> 04:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
we're seeking to do here
 
04:37:19.990 --> 04:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
is to bring the budgetary process we're
 
04:37:22.070 --> 04:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
not looking to micromanage the
 
04:37:23.830 --> 04:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
day-to-day operation we don't want to
 
04:37:26.390 --> 04:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
say you do this and you do that what
 
04:37:28.789 --> 04:37:28.799 align:start position:0%
we're saying is bring us the proposed
 
04:37:28.799 --> 04:37:30.150 align:start position:0%
we're saying is bring us the proposed
budget

04:37:30.150 --> 04:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:37:32.629 --> 04:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
let us ask the questions and we don't
 
04:37:35.029 --> 04:37:35.039 align:start position:0%
have to be experts we're not experts in
 
04:37:36.150 --> 04:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's department we're not
 
04:37:37.189 --> 04:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
experts in the nursing and we're not
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
experts in all these different
 
04:37:40.070 --> 04:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
departments we get educated by the
 
04:37:42.789 --> 04:37:42.799 align:start position:0%
department heads and we make adjustments
 
04:37:43.990 --> 04:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
that we think are appropriate for the
 
04:37:44.000 --> 04:37:45.189 align:start position:0%
that we think are appropriate for the
taxpayers

04:37:45.189 --> 04:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
04:37:46.949 --> 04:37:46.959 align:start position:0%
we didn't didn't focus on that quite
 
04:37:48.390 --> 04:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
frankly on that issue all we're
 
04:37:49.910 --> 04:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
interested in is the finances and
 
04:37:49.920 --> 04:37:51.510 align:start position:0%
interested in is the finances and
transparency

04:37:51.510 --> 04:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
04:37:53.750 --> 04:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and as i indicated we're going
 
04:37:55.670 --> 04:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
to ray howard and i are going to be
 
04:37:57.189 --> 04:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
probably submitting a
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
technical corrections amendment there's
 
04:38:01.510 --> 04:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
some some little tweaks to some of the
 
04:38:04.070 --> 04:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
technical aspects of of the bill which
 
04:38:05.109 --> 04:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
we'll probably be submitting to the
 
04:38:06.869 --> 04:38:06.879 align:start position:0%
committee later this week but not the
 
04:38:08.390 --> 04:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
bot the body of the bill is this is
 
04:38:10.070 --> 04:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
essentially the same fyi we'll be
 
04:38:11.830 --> 04:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
exacting this bill probably about a week
 
04:38:13.109 --> 04:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
04:38:14.789 --> 04:38:14.799 align:start position:0%
we'll have it before then
 
04:38:17.590 --> 04:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
okay at this point i'm going to go to
 
04:38:19.750 --> 04:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
those of you in the audience
 
04:38:23.670 --> 04:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:27.109 --> 04:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to call by the way
 
04:38:30.390 --> 04:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
we have indications of five people who
 
04:38:32.310 --> 04:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
indicated they support this bill and we
 
04:38:32.320 --> 04:38:33.429 align:start position:0%
indicated they support this bill and we
have

04:38:33.429 --> 04:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:38:35.349 --> 04:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh additional indication that somewhere
 
04:38:38.470 --> 04:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
north of 1200 oppose the bill that have
 
04:38:41.429 --> 04:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
provided input to us as i said

extensive
 
04:41:51.750 --> 04:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
gary has done a stellar job of bringing
 
04:41:54.788 --> 04:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
in quality management i didn't notice
 
04:41:57.110 --> 04:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
who was actually here
 
04:41:58.550 --> 04:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
there he is
 
04:42:00.470 --> 04:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
tom day
 
04:42:03.270 --> 04:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
who ran waterville valley for
 
04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
30 years i've known him for that 30
 
04:42:10.390 --> 04:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:10.400 --> 04:42:11.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:42:13.350 --> 04:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
gary has done a stellar job of bringing
 
04:42:15.030 --> 04:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
quality management
 
04:42:16.230 --> 04:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
04:42:19.030 --> 04:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
executing their plan exceptionally well
 
04:42:22.070 --> 04:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
gun stock is now on a terrific path it
 
04:42:25.190 --> 04:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
hasn't always been i there was
 
04:42:27.590 --> 04:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
some statements about you know it's been
 
04:42:30.310 --> 04:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:32.230 --> 04:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
it has never
 
04:42:35.830 --> 04:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
been as good as it is now never been as
 
04:42:37.910 --> 04:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
good as it was last year
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
this year is better than last year last
 
04:42:44.628 --> 04:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
year was a record year
 
04:42:47.030 --> 04:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
gunstock is now in a terrific
 
04:42:50.070 --> 04:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
path we don't want to let them ruin it
 
04:42:52.150 --> 04:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
and frankly i think they are trying to
 
04:42:53.110 --> 04:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
ruin it
 
04:42:57.190 --> 04:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
one of them wants to in reality he wants
 
04:43:00.310 --> 04:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
to lease this the area he's made those
 
04:43:02.230 --> 04:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
statements he's made them in public so
 
04:43:03.750 --> 04:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
they're in the press
 
04:43:06.390 --> 04:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
he simply wants to get rid of the ski
 
04:43:06.400 --> 04:43:07.350 align:start position:0%
he simply wants to get rid of the ski
area

04:43:07.350 --> 04:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
area
 
04:43:10.150 --> 04:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
that's not what most of us in the area
 
04:43:10.160 --> 04:43:11.110 align:start position:0%
that's not what most of us in the area
want

04:43:11.110 --> 04:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
want
 
04:43:13.990 --> 04:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
we like having our own ski area there
 
04:43:17.350 --> 04:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
it's profitable when it's run well
 
04:43:17.360 --> 04:43:18.868 align:start position:0%
it's profitable when it's run well
it's

04:43:18.868 --> 04:43:18.878 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:43:21.830 --> 04:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
frankly it can be very profitable and we
 
04:43:24.788 --> 04:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
have a plan to make it very profitable
 
04:43:27.350 --> 04:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
and i have built a number of
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
properties that are or were very
 
04:43:30.480 --> 04:43:31.990 align:start position:0%
properties that are or were very
profitable

04:43:31.990 --> 04:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
profitable
 
04:43:34.310 --> 04:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
gary has done the same thing
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
we can do it again here
 
04:43:39.990 --> 04:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions for the uh
 
04:43:40.000 --> 04:43:41.350 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions for the uh
yes

04:43:41.350 --> 04:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:43:41.360 --> 04:43:43.190 align:start position:0%
yes
representative

04:43:43.190 --> 04:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:43:45.910 --> 04:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr mcclear
 
04:43:47.830 --> 04:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
04:43:49.590 --> 04:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
04:43:49.600 --> 04:43:51.510 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
um

04:43:51.510 --> 04:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:54.230 --> 04:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
you have done a great job yes and my
 
04:43:56.230 --> 04:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
question to you is
 
04:43:58.788 --> 04:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
you are looking at gun stock commission
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
as doing a private entity that's
 
04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
or independently operated entity that's
 
04:44:07.270 --> 04:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to do what it's supposed to do
 
04:44:09.190 --> 04:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
for our state correct
 
04:44:09.200 --> 04:44:10.788 align:start position:0%
for our state correct
and

04:44:10.788 --> 04:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:44:13.110 --> 04:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
you being in the business are saying
 
04:44:16.070 --> 04:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
this is run well done well
 
04:44:18.788 --> 04:44:18.798 align:start position:0%
let that happen so that
 
04:44:22.070 --> 04:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
our state can shine as a destination
 
04:44:23.190 --> 04:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:44:28.070 --> 04:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
true to a degree i i believe
 
04:44:30.550 --> 04:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
because i had 300 employees at the hotel
 
04:44:33.510 --> 04:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
i had 300 employers at uh
 
04:44:37.910 --> 04:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
at 93 i'll have 400 employees at 95.
 
04:44:39.830 --> 04:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know we'll have 2 000 employees
 
04:44:42.150 --> 04:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
probably the time we get done i believe
 
04:44:44.788 --> 04:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
that there has to be oversight
 
04:44:47.190 --> 04:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
but the management does the oversight
 
04:44:49.350 --> 04:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
and the management knows what to look
 
04:44:52.310 --> 04:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
for and they know what to do
 
04:44:55.350 --> 04:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
follow one follow up
 
04:44:57.270 --> 04:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
so in your
 
04:45:00.070 --> 04:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
testimony you're alluding to that it's a
 
04:45:01.270 --> 04:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
well run
 
04:45:02.948 --> 04:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
and with the supervision you're not
 
04:45:06.230 --> 04:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
saying to not have the supervision but
 
04:45:07.830 --> 04:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
let the
 
04:45:10.628 --> 04:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
management take its course that they're
 
04:45:13.030 --> 04:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
doing that are doing something well let
 
04:45:15.670 --> 04:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
the people who know what they're doing
 
04:45:17.190 --> 04:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
and what to do
 
04:45:21.350 --> 04:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's really all we're looking for and
 
04:45:26.708 --> 04:45:26.718 align:start position:0%
some of the things that have been said
 
04:45:29.830 --> 04:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
about the nursing home
 
04:45:31.510 --> 04:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons we don't want
 
04:45:33.110 --> 04:45:33.120 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:46:17.590 --> 04:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
so um you mentioned in your testimony
 
04:46:22.708 --> 04:46:22.718 align:start position:0%
um the idea that
 
04:46:25.110 --> 04:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
someone or a group of people are
 
04:46:27.670 --> 04:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
interested in either privatizing gun
 
04:46:30.230 --> 04:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
stock or leasing it could you explain
 
04:46:34.150 --> 04:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
what that process would be in order to
 
04:46:35.430 --> 04:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
enact that
 
04:46:38.150 --> 04:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
what would that process look like my
 
04:46:39.990 --> 04:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
understanding and i have never my
 
04:46:42.030 --> 04:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
understanding and i've never read the
 
04:46:46.470 --> 04:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
1959 document i believe gary has
 
04:46:48.708 --> 04:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
and maybe tom has
 
04:46:51.190 --> 04:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
i believe that's open
 
04:46:54.550 --> 04:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
to allow the gun stock commissioners
 
04:46:57.270 --> 04:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
to lease and or sell
 
04:47:01.110 --> 04:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:05.270 --> 04:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
right now nobody on the commission
 
04:47:09.190 --> 04:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
in gun stock or as far as the thousands
 
04:47:10.948 --> 04:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
of people who have
 
04:47:15.270 --> 04:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
joined this effort and it is thousands
 
04:47:20.310 --> 04:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh want to see at least or sold
 
04:47:20.320 --> 04:47:21.990 align:start position:0%
uh want to see at least or sold
and

04:47:21.990 --> 04:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
the gentleman who is sitting here prior
 
04:47:27.990 --> 04:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
to this does want to see at least
 
04:47:31.190 --> 04:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
we believe we have we believe we have
 
04:47:33.590 --> 04:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
very good management
 
04:47:35.750 --> 04:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
and have
 
04:47:38.390 --> 04:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
senior management who can look towards
 
04:47:40.948 --> 04:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
the future and say this is what should
 
04:47:43.110 --> 04:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
be done with us
 
04:47:46.070 --> 04:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair okay so to be clear
 
04:47:48.628 --> 04:47:48.638 align:start position:0%
that your answer to my question um who
 
04:47:48.638 --> 04:47:49.350 align:start position:0%
that your answer to my question um who
would

04:47:49.350 --> 04:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:47:51.510 --> 04:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately make that decision your
 
04:47:53.590 --> 04:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
answer is that
 
04:47:56.390 --> 04:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
the gun stock commissioners
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
would make the decision whether or not
 
04:48:01.510 --> 04:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
to lease or privatize gun stock
 
04:48:03.430 --> 04:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
the gun stock commissioners will be the
 
04:48:05.190 --> 04:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
ones who will put the plan together
 
04:48:10.550 --> 04:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:14.150 --> 04:48:14.160 align:start position:0%

04:48:45.110 --> 04:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
the best year ever out of whatever it is
 
04:48:48.230 --> 04:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
65 years or something like that so it's
 
04:48:49.670 --> 04:48:49.680 align:start position:0%

like political game playing
 
04:51:38.868 --> 04:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
last fall
 
04:51:40.708 --> 04:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
someone showed me this bill
 
04:51:43.030 --> 04:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
and at the time i was not aware of the
 
04:51:44.788 --> 04:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
let's call it the interesting dynamic
 
04:51:46.470 --> 04:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
between the commission and the
 
04:51:46.480 --> 04:51:47.990 align:start position:0%
between the commission and the
delegation

04:51:47.990 --> 04:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
04:51:49.590 --> 04:51:49.600 align:start position:0%

04:51:52.230 --> 04:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
heck is this this makes no sense at all
 
04:51:53.750 --> 04:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
no sense
 
04:51:55.670 --> 04:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
there are many theories about running
 
04:51:55.680 --> 04:51:57.110 align:start position:0%
there are many theories about running
businesses

04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
04:51:59.270 --> 04:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
new ones come along every year you could
 
04:52:01.830 --> 04:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
cover all of these tables with the books
 
04:52:03.910 --> 04:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
that come out citing new theories new
 
04:52:06.070 --> 04:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
gimmicks new miracle cures for the
 
04:52:08.310 --> 04:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
world's business problems you probably
 
04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
all have some of them on your coffee
 
04:52:12.788 --> 04:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
tables let me tell you not a single one
 
04:52:14.948 --> 04:52:14.958 align:start position:0%
of them advocates taking financial
 
04:52:17.270 --> 04:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
control away from the board of directors
 
04:52:19.430 --> 04:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
and of course the area commission
 
04:52:20.948 --> 04:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
is the board
 
04:52:23.430 --> 04:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
taking financial control away from the
 
04:52:27.270 --> 04:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:28.708 --> 04:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
boards of directors are typically
 
04:52:31.110 --> 04:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
empowered to take full responsibility
 
04:52:32.708 --> 04:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
for running a business
 
04:52:34.628 --> 04:52:34.638 align:start position:0%
and they're measured by results
 
04:52:36.628 --> 04:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
that works
 
04:52:38.868 --> 04:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
as mr silber correctly said they set
 
04:52:40.868 --> 04:52:40.878 align:start position:0%
their budget in their own way
 
04:52:42.868 --> 04:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
with no public budgeting they're
 
04:52:45.670 --> 04:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
accountable for their results
 
04:52:47.670 --> 04:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
imagine this conversation
 
04:52:51.830 --> 04:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
between robert kraft and bill
 
04:52:51.840 --> 04:52:52.708 align:start position:0%
between robert kraft and bill
bill

04:52:52.708 --> 04:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:52:54.070 --> 04:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to talk to you about your
 
04:52:54.080 --> 04:52:55.590 align:start position:0%
i'd like to talk to you about your
playbook

04:52:55.590 --> 04:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
playbook
 
04:52:58.470 --> 04:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
from now on it will need my approval
 
04:53:00.628 --> 04:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
not just upfront but all the changes
 
04:53:01.990 --> 04:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
along the way
 
04:53:03.910 --> 04:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
even during games
 
04:53:07.030 --> 04:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
how do you think that would go over
 
04:53:09.030 --> 04:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
it would be seismic
 
04:53:10.708 --> 04:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
so much for business theory let's take a
 
04:53:12.628 --> 04:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
look at gunstock
 
04:53:14.470 --> 04:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
when i first skied here there were a
 
04:53:16.948 --> 04:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
bunch of t-bars and even that cute
 
04:53:18.390 --> 04:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
single chair that some of you may
 
04:53:20.788 --> 04:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
remember from 1938
 
04:53:22.708 --> 04:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
today look at the place
 
04:53:25.910 --> 04:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's a competitive four season resort
 
04:53:28.550 --> 04:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
and that evolution did not just happen
 
04:53:31.590 --> 04:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
it was brought about by 60 plus years of
 
04:53:34.230 --> 04:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
good management and
 
04:53:36.230 --> 04:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
decades of commissioners
 
04:53:37.910 --> 04:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's fiscally stable
 
04:53:40.708 --> 04:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
it's profitable it's popular and it's
 
04:53:42.788 --> 04:53:42.798 align:start position:0%
having its best years in history as as
 
04:53:44.708 --> 04:53:44.718 align:start position:0%
you have already heard this morning
 
04:53:48.070 --> 04:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
that business model is working
 
04:53:49.510 --> 04:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
so you might ask
 
04:53:51.430 --> 04:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
what really is the agenda of the bill's
 
04:53:51.440 --> 04:53:53.110 align:start position:0%
what really is the agenda of the bill's
sponsors

04:53:53.110 --> 04:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
sponsors
 
04:53:55.030 --> 04:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
do they have a formula to make gun stock
 
04:53:56.550 --> 04:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
work even better
 
04:53:58.470 --> 04:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
i doubt that very much
 
04:54:00.390 --> 04:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
do they want to take over because they
 
04:54:03.590 --> 04:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
know so much about ski area management
 
04:54:03.600 --> 04:54:05.190 align:start position:0%
know so much about ski area management
hardly

04:54:05.190 --> 04:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
hardly
 
04:54:07.030 --> 04:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
are they worried that gun stock is a
 
04:54:09.190 --> 04:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
drain on the taxpayer
 
04:54:11.910 --> 04:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
not exactly it does not cause belknap's
 
04:54:14.230 --> 04:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers a dime and as you've heard
 
04:54:16.868 --> 04:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
last year they had a record profits and
 
04:54:18.708 --> 04:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
passed a quarter of a million dollars
 
04:54:21.270 --> 04:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
over to the county
 
04:54:23.270 --> 04:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative silver says gun stock
 
04:54:25.750 --> 04:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
should be accountable to the taxpayers
 
04:54:27.510 --> 04:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
in the same way as other county
 
04:54:27.520 --> 04:54:28.868 align:start position:0%
in the same way as other county
operations

04:54:28.868 --> 04:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
operations
 
04:54:28.878 --> 04:54:30.230 align:start position:0%
operations
that

04:54:30.230 --> 04:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:32.070 --> 04:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
i ask you to
 
04:54:35.190 --> 04:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh in your continued testimony to
 
04:54:37.990 --> 04:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
be careful about calling out individuals
 
04:54:38.000 --> 04:54:39.190 align:start position:0%
be careful about calling out individuals
and

04:54:39.190 --> 04:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:54:39.200 --> 04:54:41.270 align:start position:0%
and
rendering

04:54:41.270 --> 04:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
rendering
 
04:54:43.350 --> 04:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
disparaging information about them i i
 
04:54:44.788 --> 04:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
think you can make your point without
 
04:54:46.708 --> 04:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
that okay i was actually quoting
 
04:54:48.070 --> 04:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
something i read in the paper but that
 
04:54:51.190 --> 04:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's fine so it's it's been emphasized
 
04:54:53.430 --> 04:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of the bill
 
04:54:56.470 --> 04:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
really want uh gunstock to be a de facto
 
04:54:58.628 --> 04:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
department of the county they want to
 
04:55:00.948 --> 04:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
control it like the nursing home where
 
04:55:03.270 --> 04:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
the oxygen budget was cut they won't
 
04:55:05.190 --> 04:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
approve competitive wages and as a
 
04:55:07.910 --> 04:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
result the nursing home is short staffed
 
04:55:09.990 --> 04:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
where quality of service is not part of
 
04:55:12.230 --> 04:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
the equation it's all about cutting
 
04:55:12.240 --> 04:55:14.230 align:start position:0%
the equation it's all about cutting
taxes

04:55:14.230 --> 04:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
04:55:17.030 --> 04:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
the 1959 enabling act was designed
 
04:55:20.070 --> 04:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
expressly to keep gunstock's operation
 
04:55:23.030 --> 04:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
independent of government and politics
 
04:55:24.788 --> 04:55:24.798 align:start position:0%
so it could be professionally managed
 
04:55:27.190 --> 04:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
like any business enterprise
 
04:55:29.270 --> 04:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
and that's worked pretty well for 62
 
04:55:29.280 --> 04:55:30.390 align:start position:0%
and that's worked pretty well for 62
years

04:55:30.390 --> 04:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:55:32.550 --> 04:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
in my view this is nothing but a
 
04:55:34.948 --> 04:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
transparent effort to the
 
04:55:37.190 --> 04:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
enabling act so that gunstock will
 
04:55:40.150 --> 04:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
become a de facto county department so
 
04:55:42.390 --> 04:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
why not just be honest and sponsor a
 
04:55:46.550 --> 04:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the interests of good government good
 
04:55:50.470 --> 04:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
business and plain old yankee common
 
04:55:52.948 --> 04:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
sense i urge you to vote no on this
 
04:55:54.628 --> 04:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
reckless bill
 
04:55:56.310 --> 04:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any
 
04:55:56.320 --> 04:55:57.670 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any
questions

04:55:57.670 --> 04:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:56:00.948 --> 04:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:03.110 --> 04:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:56:04.470 --> 04:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
in your
 
04:56:09.110 --> 04:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
is it
 
04:56:11.110 --> 04:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to phrase it in a form of
 
04:56:11.120 --> 04:56:12.150 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to phrase it in a form of
question

04:56:12.150 --> 04:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:56:15.430 --> 04:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
would you believe that this is a
 
04:56:18.868 --> 04:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
well-run private enterprise with a
 
04:56:21.190 --> 04:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
partnership with the public which is it
 
04:56:23.430 --> 04:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
pays back to the ratepayers of belknap
 
04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
county absolutely and so
 
04:56:29.110 --> 04:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
well it's making the positive
 
04:56:31.590 --> 04:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
impact or in the right direction
 
04:56:35.990 --> 04:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
as a taxpayer or as a businessman you
 
04:56:38.948 --> 04:56:38.958 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that you oppose this
 
04:56:40.550 --> 04:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
because it's going to disrupt the
 
04:56:40.560 --> 04:56:41.830 align:start position:0%
because it's going to disrupt the
progress

04:56:41.830 --> 04:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
progress
 
04:56:43.670 --> 04:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely i think there's a point where
 
04:56:46.470 --> 04:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
you have to let managers manage
 
04:56:50.150 --> 04:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:52.550 --> 04:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
so would you consider this as a good
 
04:56:54.470 --> 04:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
public private partnership that's
 
04:56:56.788 --> 04:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
working well for our state extremely
 
04:56:58.868 --> 04:56:58.878 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
04:56:58.878 --> 04:57:00.150 align:start position:0%
well thank you

okay i would uh
 
04:57:04.948 --> 04:57:04.958 align:start position:0%

at this point like the carrot call on uh
gary

04:57:07.910 --> 04:57:07.920 align:start position:0%

04:57:29.910 --> 04:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak i i actually was
 
04:57:31.590 --> 04:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
hoping to ask for some extra time to
 
04:57:34.868 --> 04:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
respond to some testimony given by
 
04:57:34.878 --> 04:57:35.990 align:start position:0%
respond to some testimony given by
uh

04:57:35.990 --> 04:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:57:36.000 --> 04:57:37.670 align:start position:0%
uh
the

04:57:37.670 --> 04:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:57:39.190 --> 04:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
by i guess i'm not supposed to mention
 
04:57:40.708 --> 04:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
his name but
 
04:57:43.030 --> 04:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of this bill
 
04:57:45.110 --> 04:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
and perhaps to correct some of the
 
04:57:47.430 --> 04:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
points that i believe he's misleading
 
04:57:49.590 --> 04:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
this group and would like to do that
 
04:57:51.990 --> 04:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
but let me let me quickly go through my
 
04:57:54.150 --> 04:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
my prepared comments and then hopefully
 
04:57:56.150 --> 04:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
have time to address that or we can have
 
04:57:58.788 --> 04:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
that come through during the questions
 
04:58:01.270 --> 04:58:01.280 align:start position:0%

chairman for the last 18 months and
 
04:58:08.470 --> 04:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
transitioned through the
 
04:58:11.590 --> 04:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
for the rolling process of chairman
 
04:58:15.030 --> 04:58:15.040 align:start position:0%

leader that gathers talent around a

04:59:55.990 --> 04:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
belmont county delegation appointed me

to the gac three plus years ago by a
 
05:00:01.510 --> 05:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
vote of fourteen to one
 
05:00:03.830 --> 05:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
because i assured the delegation it
 
05:00:05.830 --> 05:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
could be run as a su as a
 
05:00:08.948 --> 05:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
self-sustaining business
 
05:00:11.590 --> 05:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
for the past two years gun stock has
 
05:00:14.310 --> 05:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
done just that it's operated one hundred
 
05:00:17.350 --> 05:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
percent independently not needing a
 
05:00:19.990 --> 05:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
seasonal bridge loan known as a revenue
 
05:00:22.070 --> 05:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
anticipation note which has to be
 
05:00:24.550 --> 05:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
required by by the county
 
05:00:27.110 --> 05:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's because we generated enough
 
05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
income to pay for the expenses which was
 
05:00:32.390 --> 05:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
previously represented to equally
 
05:00:34.788 --> 05:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
slightly above the nursing home
 
05:00:37.430 --> 05:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's quite a miscarriage the nursing
 
05:00:39.110 --> 05:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
home doesn't have income the nursing
 
05:00:42.390 --> 05:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
home gets gets funded by taxes gunstock
 
05:00:44.708 --> 05:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
mountain resort has no
 
05:00:47.110 --> 05:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism or resources coming from
 
05:00:49.270 --> 05:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers it is a hundred percent
 
05:00:52.150 --> 05:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
independent it generates its income from
 
05:00:54.310 --> 05:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
paying customers who are willing to come
 
05:00:56.070 --> 05:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
and pay for their goods goods and
 
05:00:56.080 --> 05:00:57.510 align:start position:0%
and pay for their goods goods and
services

05:00:57.510 --> 05:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:00:59.910 --> 05:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to defer to
 
05:01:02.150 --> 05:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
our cfo kathy white who will report
 
05:01:04.550 --> 05:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
today and testify to take you through
 
05:01:06.708 --> 05:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
gun stock's strong financial performance
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:13.670 --> 05:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
and relative to a comment earlier there
 
05:01:16.230 --> 05:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
are multiple petitions circulating with
 
05:01:19.110 --> 05:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
over three thousand signatures opposing
 
05:01:22.628 --> 05:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
actions to include house bill 1078 it's
 
05:01:25.590 --> 05:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
not just a well-organized
 
05:01:28.628 --> 05:01:28.638 align:start position:0%
mechanism it's the public speaking it's
 
05:01:31.030 --> 05:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
a public saying what they want
 
05:01:33.910 --> 05:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
and the delegation is not listening and
 
05:01:35.990 --> 05:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
that is terrifying to think that they
 
05:01:38.230 --> 05:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
could gain control of the operations
 
05:01:39.990 --> 05:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
through the budget control if you
 
05:01:42.150 --> 05:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
contain the control the budget you
 
05:01:43.590 --> 05:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
control the business
 
05:01:45.590 --> 05:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
there's no other way to do it
 
05:01:47.510 --> 05:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
gun stock mountain resort is a treasured
 
05:01:47.520 --> 05:01:48.310 align:start position:0%
gun stock mountain resort is a treasured
gem

05:01:48.310 --> 05:01:48.320 align:start position:0%

05:01:50.628 --> 05:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
it was developed in the 1930s by the u.s
 
05:01:52.868 --> 05:01:52.878 align:start position:0%
government works works progress
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%

was stole so vermont cannon mountain and
 
05:02:00.150 --> 05:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
others around the country
 
05:02:01.830 --> 05:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
the first ski lift in new hampshire was
 
05:02:04.628 --> 05:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
built by the wpa on today's gun stock
 
05:02:07.670 --> 05:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
mountain in 1936 and 30 37 and
 
05:02:09.830 --> 05:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
recreation has been offered there
 
05:02:13.430 --> 05:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
successfully every year was since with
 
05:02:15.510 --> 05:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
multiple olympic champions representing
 
05:02:17.430 --> 05:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire coming from our slopes and
 
05:02:20.708 --> 05:02:20.718 align:start position:0%
ski jumps this is a big sense of pride
 
05:02:23.350 --> 05:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
this is something we should all protect
 
05:02:24.708 --> 05:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
like a child
 
05:02:27.910 --> 05:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
in 1959 the state of new hampshire gave
 
05:02:30.310 --> 05:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
gunstock mountain resort to the citizens
 
05:02:33.110 --> 05:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
of belknap county and legislated into
 
05:02:35.910 --> 05:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
law the 1959 enabling act which
 
05:02:37.590 --> 05:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
established the gun stock area

commission
 
05:02:40.708 --> 05:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
the law gave responsibility and
 
05:02:43.510 --> 05:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
authority to the gac to operate gunstock
 
05:02:46.868 --> 05:02:46.878 align:start position:0%
as an enterprise of belknap county
 
05:02:49.510 --> 05:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
the gac consists of five rotating
 
05:02:52.390 --> 05:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
experienced business county leaders like
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
myself and rusty mcclear who functioned
 
05:02:57.350 --> 05:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
as a board of directors and was given
 
05:03:00.390 --> 05:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
broad powers to operate develop and
 
05:03:00.400 --> 05:03:01.270 align:start position:0%
broad powers to operate develop and
and

05:03:01.270 --> 05:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:03:03.110 --> 05:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
to operate and develop the recreation
 
05:03:05.590 --> 05:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
area and has been doing so successfully
 
05:03:07.990 --> 05:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
since 1959
 
05:03:11.270 --> 05:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
gac was established with a clear purpose
 
05:03:13.270 --> 05:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
at that time and if you go back in the
 
05:03:15.670 --> 05:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
history you'll see this in writings to
 
05:03:18.948 --> 05:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
get politics out of gun stock
 
05:03:20.868 --> 05:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
i have with me a letter headlined
 
05:03:22.550 --> 05:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
budgetary control
 
05:03:23.990 --> 05:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
must remain
 
05:03:26.310 --> 05:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
must remain with gun stock commission
 
05:03:29.030 --> 05:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's from 16 former gac commissioners
 
05:03:32.470 --> 05:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
representing collectively 150 years of
 
05:03:34.708 --> 05:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
service to gun stock mountain mountain
 
05:03:37.350 --> 05:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
resort the letter represents strong
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 1078 and should
 
05:03:42.150 --> 05:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
be noted by this committee and i will
 
05:03:44.070 --> 05:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
leave you with with copies of it i
 
05:03:45.990 --> 05:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate you considering
 
05:03:46.000 --> 05:03:47.830 align:start position:0%
appreciate you considering
those

05:03:47.830 --> 05:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:03:50.070 --> 05:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
prior commissioners while there is a
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
dispute between the key sponsors of
 
05:03:55.750 --> 05:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 1078 and the gac as to what
 
05:03:58.390 --> 05:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
gun stock is
 
05:04:00.470 --> 05:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
and how it should be run i can assure
 
05:04:02.948 --> 05:04:02.958 align:start position:0%
you gun stock is a business in every
 
05:04:04.948 --> 05:04:04.958 align:start position:0%
definition and must be managed
 
05:04:07.190 --> 05:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
accordingly not like a government
 
05:04:07.200 --> 05:04:08.310 align:start position:0%
accordingly not like a government
department

05:04:08.310 --> 05:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:04:11.430 --> 05:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
gmr and i'm repeating gmr genera
 
05:04:13.350 --> 05:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
generates gunshot wound resorts or
 
05:04:14.708 --> 05:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
generates a hundred percent of its
 
05:04:17.510 --> 05:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
revenue from customers who freely choose
 
05:04:19.830 --> 05:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
to buy gun stocks goods and services
 
05:04:21.830 --> 05:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
unlike the nursing home there are no
 
05:04:24.070 --> 05:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
federal local or taxpayer funds that go
 
05:04:26.470 --> 05:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
to support gun stock
 
05:04:28.670 --> 05:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
conversely gun stock pays belknap county
 
05:04:31.470 --> 05:04:31.480 align:start position:0%
1.75 percent of its gross revenue
 
05:04:34.948 --> 05:04:34.958 align:start position:0%
247 thousand dollars in 2021 and with
 
05:04:36.948 --> 05:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
all other funds going to pay for goods
 
05:04:39.110 --> 05:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
and services care and maintenance and
 
05:04:41.430 --> 05:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
the very important practice of
 
05:04:43.830 --> 05:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
establishing reserves to pay for future
 
05:04:46.550 --> 05:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
capital improvements in order to sustain
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
and maintain the property
 
05:04:51.270 --> 05:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
because gun stock is a business it must
 
05:04:52.868 --> 05:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
operate like a business to compete and
 
05:04:54.868 --> 05:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
thrive you asked a question earlier
 
05:04:56.150 --> 05:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
about how does it compare to weather
 
05:04:58.470 --> 05:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
survive time i'd be happy to share that
 
05:05:00.070 --> 05:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
with you because i have a lot of
 
05:05:02.230 --> 05:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge about that we work with a
 
05:05:04.868 --> 05:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
long-range plan and an annual operating
 
05:05:07.110 --> 05:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
plan from which a yearly budget and
 
05:05:09.510 --> 05:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
capital plan is established
 
05:05:11.750 --> 05:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
management prepares the budget and after
 
05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
careful consideration by the gac
 
05:05:16.788 --> 05:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
approves and monitors it
 
05:05:18.868 --> 05:05:18.878 align:start position:0%
because there are many uncontrollable
 
05:05:20.708 --> 05:05:20.718 align:start position:0%
variables that present themselves during
 
05:05:20.718 --> 05:05:21.990 align:start position:0%

05:05:24.628 --> 05:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
during business years such as weather
 
05:05:26.948 --> 05:05:26.958 align:start position:0%
equipment failures the area needs to be
 
05:05:28.628 --> 05:05:28.638 align:start position:0%
able to adjust and move funds from
 
05:05:30.708 --> 05:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
various departments while keeping within
 
05:05:32.628 --> 05:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
the guardrails of the budget in order to
 
05:05:34.390 --> 05:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
keep the business running
 
05:05:34.400 --> 05:05:35.590 align:start position:0%
keep the business running
imagine

05:05:35.590 --> 05:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
05:05:38.628 --> 05:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
a breakdown of a lift on christmas week
 
05:05:40.830 --> 05:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
martin luther king weekend february
 
05:05:43.670 --> 05:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
vacation we make money in 16 weeks of
 
05:05:45.590 --> 05:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
the year and we have to go to the
 
05:05:47.670 --> 05:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
delegation and ask them for approval to
 
05:05:49.030 --> 05:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
move 300
 
05:05:51.270 --> 05:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
from snow making to a lift
 
05:05:53.510 --> 05:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
that is what that is what's being asked
 
05:05:55.430 --> 05:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
and if you approve this bill that is
 
05:05:58.150 --> 05:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
what will be will be subjected to and i
 
05:06:00.470 --> 05:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
as an experienced business manager an
 
05:06:02.788 --> 05:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
executive and ski area operator can
 
05:06:05.590 --> 05:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
assure you that will put gun suck
 
05:06:11.270 --> 05:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:13.510 --> 05:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
the county delegation and chair of
 
05:06:13.520 --> 05:06:14.708 align:start position:0%
the county delegation and chair of
observe

05:06:14.708 --> 05:06:14.718 align:start position:0%
observe
 
05:06:16.788 --> 05:06:16.798 align:start position:0%
gun stock meetings
 
05:06:19.030 --> 05:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
and there's only one meeting that i know
 
05:06:21.270 --> 05:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
of in the last three years that i've
 
05:06:22.708 --> 05:06:22.718 align:start position:0%
been on the commission
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
that either the chair or the vice chair
 
05:06:27.990 --> 05:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
of the belknap county commission did not
 
05:06:29.830 --> 05:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
sit in and monitor
 
05:06:32.070 --> 05:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
we ask them to sit at our table
 
05:06:33.990 --> 05:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
they they refuse
 
05:06:35.670 --> 05:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
we ask them if they have any questions
 
05:06:39.990 --> 05:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:41.750 --> 05:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know why they don't ask maybe
 
05:06:43.750 --> 05:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
they don't understand them
 
05:06:46.230 --> 05:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
but they don't ask there are multiple
 
05:06:47.750 --> 05:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities for them to have this
 
05:06:47.760 --> 05:06:48.868 align:start position:0%
opportunities for them to have this
review

05:06:48.868 --> 05:06:48.878 align:start position:0%
review
 
05:06:50.550 --> 05:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
every single month and you're going to
 
05:06:53.430 --> 05:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
hear from our cfo
 
05:06:55.350 --> 05:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
and you're going to see the level of
 
05:06:57.430 --> 05:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
departmental breakdown and financial
 
05:06:59.670 --> 05:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
controls that we have
 
05:07:01.750 --> 05:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
they get to look at that that is an
 
05:07:03.910 --> 05:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
oversight that is more than i've ever
 
05:07:05.670 --> 05:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
seen in any of the companies that i'm on
 
05:07:09.830 --> 05:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:11.190 --> 05:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
i'm going to skip here a little bit
 
05:07:11.200 --> 05:07:12.150 align:start position:0%
i'm going to skip here a little bit
about

05:07:12.150 --> 05:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:07:13.990 --> 05:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
i had to say about the nursing nursing
 
05:07:15.190 --> 05:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
home but
 
05:07:17.510 --> 05:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
i want to call your attention

employees i have a copy of that several
 
05:07:32.550 --> 05:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
copies of them here i would encourage
 
05:07:34.550 --> 05:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
you to read that article you may have
 
05:07:37.430 --> 05:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
already seen it it really frames
 
05:07:41.030 --> 05:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
in an unbiased way what is going on
 
05:07:43.030 --> 05:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
and what the employees of gun stock
 
05:07:44.948 --> 05:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
mountain resort are dealing with and
 
05:07:47.350 --> 05:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
what what the
 
05:07:47.750 --> 05:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
if you gac
 
05:07:49.270 --> 05:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
copies of that could you provide it to
 
05:07:49.280 --> 05:07:50.070 align:start position:0%
copies of that could you provide it to
us

05:07:50.070 --> 05:07:50.080 align:start position:0%

i will provide them i have copies i
 
05:07:52.948 --> 05:07:52.958 align:start position:0%
don't think i have enough for all of you
 
05:07:55.990 --> 05:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
but just give one to the clerk okay
 
05:07:59.110 --> 05:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
um i will also provide copies of um the
 
05:08:01.830 --> 05:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
letter from the gac
 
05:08:04.310 --> 05:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
for former uh commissioners
 
05:08:05.830 --> 05:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
with my professional experience and
 
05:08:08.470 --> 05:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
opinion if house bill 1078 is voted into
 
05:08:10.708 --> 05:08:10.718 align:start position:0%
law it will have long lasting undue
 
05:08:13.270 --> 05:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
consequences and hobbled
 
05:08:15.270 --> 05:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
the continued successful operation of
 
05:08:17.510 --> 05:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
gunstock mountain resort and i will tell
 
05:08:19.110 --> 05:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
you it is
 
05:08:19.120 --> 05:08:20.788 align:start position:0%
you it is
incredibly

05:08:20.788 --> 05:08:20.798 align:start position:0%
incredibly
 
05:08:24.070 --> 05:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
disingenuous for anybody to say that the
 
05:08:25.670 --> 05:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
only reason gun stock was successful
 
05:08:27.590 --> 05:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
last year was because of covet
 
05:08:27.600 --> 05:08:29.030 align:start position:0%
last year was because of covet
please

05:08:29.030 --> 05:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:08:30.868 --> 05:08:30.878 align:start position:0%
think about what it took to run that
 
05:08:33.110 --> 05:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
operation and keep the employees safe
 
05:08:34.628 --> 05:08:34.638 align:start position:0%
and our customers safe and the
 
05:08:36.628 --> 05:08:36.638 align:start position:0%
incremental expense of cleaning that
 
05:08:38.788 --> 05:08:38.798 align:start position:0%
those buildings and the loss of our food
 
05:08:40.470 --> 05:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
and beverage revenue and still be able
 
05:08:41.590 --> 05:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
05:08:43.750 --> 05:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
that is the most insulting thing i have
 
05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
ever seen and that's what the headaches
 
05:08:48.470 --> 05:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
come from you can't turn the turn this
 
05:08:55.830 --> 05:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:56.830 --> 05:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
if that
 
05:09:00.310 --> 05:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
happens it will be relegated relocating
 
05:09:01.510 --> 05:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
gun stock to a position of
 
05:09:04.470 --> 05:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
non-competitiveness possible failure
 
05:09:06.070 --> 05:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
like the missteps of many former new
 
05:09:08.470 --> 05:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire ski areas we need to get
 
05:09:10.550 --> 05:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
politics out of gun stock mountain
 
05:09:14.150 --> 05:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
resort it was taken out in 1959 and that
 
05:09:17.910 --> 05:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
was the intent of the 1959 uh enabling
 
05:09:17.920 --> 05:09:18.868 align:start position:0%
was the intent of the 1959 uh enabling

after

05:09:25.030 --> 05:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
after
 
05:09:28.628 --> 05:09:28.638 align:start position:0%
november 17 2001 meeting to oppose house
 
05:09:31.830 --> 05:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
bill 1078 and i asked the committee here
 
05:09:33.910 --> 05:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
to do likewise and a vote against this
 
05:09:33.920 --> 05:09:34.868 align:start position:0%

now i scribbled some quick notes um
 
05:09:39.270 --> 05:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
and i heard
 
05:09:43.670 --> 05:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony that a few years ago
 
05:09:46.310 --> 05:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
the county had to make up for
 
05:09:49.190 --> 05:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
a failed financial matter and payout
 
05:09:52.230 --> 05:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
paid off that was 20 years ago
 
05:09:54.310 --> 05:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
it was the only time we know of that it
 
05:09:54.320 --> 05:09:55.350 align:start position:0%
it was the only time we know of that it
happened

05:09:55.350 --> 05:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
happened
 
05:09:56.788 --> 05:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
and the county
 
05:09:58.470 --> 05:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
and gun stock
 
05:10:01.190 --> 05:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
put together a plan to pay it off and
 
05:10:03.510 --> 05:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
we've been willing way at it
 
05:10:03.520 --> 05:10:07.030 align:start position:0%
we've been willing way at it
um

05:10:07.030 --> 05:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:09.110 --> 05:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
we're not a taxpayer
 
05:10:11.590 --> 05:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
we pay 247 thousand dollars to the
 
05:10:11.600 --> 05:10:12.708 align:start position:0%
we pay 247 thousand dollars to the
county

05:10:12.708 --> 05:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
county
 
05:10:14.628 --> 05:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
take a look at what waterville valley
 
05:10:17.110 --> 05:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
pays to waterville take a look at what
 
05:10:19.830 --> 05:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
loon ski area plays to
 
05:10:21.350 --> 05:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
the town of lincoln
 
05:10:25.110 --> 05:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
they do not pay 247 000 so don't paint
 
05:10:28.550 --> 05:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
us as a group that do not uh pay taxes
 
05:10:30.390 --> 05:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
and as for bonuses
 
05:10:33.190 --> 05:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
we got to be very clear here
 
05:10:35.590 --> 05:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
i sit as i mentioned earlier i sit on on

identify tom day
 
05:11:09.190 --> 05:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
their analysis of compensation
 
05:11:11.510 --> 05:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the industry in new hampshire
 
05:11:13.830 --> 05:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
in new england in the midwest and the
 
05:11:16.628 --> 05:11:16.638 align:start position:0%
west coast it was very comprehensive and
 
05:11:18.470 --> 05:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
tom day's compensation i shouldn't be
 
05:11:19.910 --> 05:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
saying this in front of him
 
05:11:22.708 --> 05:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
his base of 180 is below market
 
05:11:25.270 --> 05:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
we knew that and we put in his contract
 
05:11:27.430 --> 05:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
that we would establish a long-term
 
05:11:29.110 --> 05:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
incentive plan
 
05:11:31.910 --> 05:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
but when they turned the business so
 
05:11:34.788 --> 05:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
successful last year and worked so hard
 
05:11:37.670 --> 05:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
at it and we had money way over what the
 
05:11:40.470 --> 05:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
budget was supposed to be
 
05:11:43.350 --> 05:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
brian gallagher and myself as vice chair
 
05:11:46.390 --> 05:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
went to ray howard and mike sylvia
 
05:11:48.230 --> 05:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
privately and said
 
05:11:49.990 --> 05:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
we think we're thinking about paying
 
05:11:52.310 --> 05:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
bonuses what do you think
 
05:11:54.628 --> 05:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
nobody set off red lights nobody sent
 
05:11:56.948 --> 05:11:56.958 align:start position:0%
yellow lights nobody jumped up and down
 
05:11:58.310 --> 05:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
and said nothing
 
05:12:01.510 --> 05:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
just sort of said okay
 
05:12:02.708 --> 05:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:12:05.190 --> 05:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
as we finish the year and as the audit
 
05:12:07.990 --> 05:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
added audit produced evidence that we
 
05:12:10.550 --> 05:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
could pay the bonuses and the bonuses
 
05:12:12.868 --> 05:12:12.878 align:start position:0%
are not out of taxpayers money it would
 
05:12:16.070 --> 05:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
is paid in excess money that they made
 
05:12:18.310 --> 05:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
over and above this year's annual budget
 
05:12:20.230 --> 05:12:20.240 align:start position:0%

05:16:40.550 --> 05:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
which is a major insurer of the ski
 
05:16:42.788 --> 05:16:42.798 align:start position:0%
business and i worked for them for five
 
05:16:45.510 --> 05:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
years and i in the process of that time
 
05:16:47.190 --> 05:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
i traveled throughout the country
 
05:16:48.948 --> 05:16:48.958 align:start position:0%
inspecting ski areas and talking with
 
05:16:51.030 --> 05:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
the management at ski areas i did about
 
05:16:53.430 --> 05:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
40 skiers at that time i'm also on the
 
05:16:55.510 --> 05:16:55.520 align:start position:0%

05:17:00.708 --> 05:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
leadership in the ski business that ski
 
05:17:01.990 --> 05:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:17:04.150 --> 05:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
gives out so all the gm's a lot of the
 
05:17:05.750 --> 05:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
gm's in the ski business are on the ski
 
05:17:07.190 --> 05:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire board
 
05:17:08.470 --> 05:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:17:11.430 --> 05:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
i started working in january 15th 2020
 
05:17:14.150 --> 05:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
at gunstock and uh it's been an
 
05:17:16.550 --> 05:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
exceptionally good experience for me
 
05:17:19.430 --> 05:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
the ski area is of gem as they said in
 
05:17:22.150 --> 05:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
belknap county there's a lot of great
 
05:17:23.510 --> 05:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
people that work there that have helped
 
05:17:26.470 --> 05:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
us get to the spot that we needed to be
 
05:17:28.070 --> 05:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that i think is
 
05:17:30.470 --> 05:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
important to understand is that the gun
 
05:17:32.310 --> 05:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
stock area commission doing businesses
 
05:17:33.910 --> 05:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
gun stock mountain resort is a business
 
05:17:36.628 --> 05:17:36.638 align:start position:0%
owned by belknap county we generate all
 
05:17:39.110 --> 05:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
the cash to sustain the operation we
 
05:17:41.510 --> 05:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
receive no money from the county or any
 
05:17:44.070 --> 05:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
of the taxpayers of belknap county
 
05:17:45.830 --> 05:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's extremely important to the success
 
05:17:47.670 --> 05:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
of gun stock that is allowed to continue
 
05:17:49.830 --> 05:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
operating as a business managed by a
 
05:17:52.070 --> 05:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
senior team of professionals with
 
05:17:53.910 --> 05:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
guidance provided by the gunstock area
 
05:17:55.990 --> 05:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
commission and one of the things i know
 
05:17:57.510 --> 05:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of comparisons to the
 
05:17:59.350 --> 05:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
nursing home and this and that and you
 
05:18:01.590 --> 05:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
know the whole politics of what what
 
05:18:03.270 --> 05:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
what goes on is is something that i'm
 
05:18:03.280 --> 05:18:04.948 align:start position:0%
what goes on is is something that i'm
i'm

05:18:04.948 --> 05:18:04.958 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
05:18:07.110 --> 05:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
becoming exposed to or was never aware
 
05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
of before i'm here i came here because
 
05:18:12.070 --> 05:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
they the former gm retired and they
 
05:18:13.670 --> 05:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
wanted someone to come in here and run
 
05:18:16.390 --> 05:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
the business run it as a business and be
 
05:18:18.868 --> 05:18:18.878 align:start position:0%
able to get us some good um
 
05:18:20.788 --> 05:18:20.798 align:start position:0%
financial achievements which which we've
 
05:18:24.550 --> 05:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
done i do as we echo gary's um sentiment
 
05:18:26.310 --> 05:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the fact that the
 
05:18:27.990 --> 05:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
reason that we did well was because of
 
05:18:29.990 --> 05:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
covin that's just
 
05:18:32.390 --> 05:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's sp spoken by someone that doesn't
 
05:18:34.788 --> 05:18:34.798 align:start position:0%
understand running a ski business at all
 
05:18:36.708 --> 05:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
so that's that was ridiculous it was a
 
05:18:38.788 --> 05:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
very difficult year we did well we did a
 
05:18:40.550 --> 05:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
lot of adjusting and that's the thing
 
05:18:42.390 --> 05:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
that is concerns me most about this
 
05:18:44.788 --> 05:18:44.798 align:start position:0%
house bill you really have to adjust in
 
05:18:46.470 --> 05:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
the ski business as gary said you have
 
05:18:48.628 --> 05:18:48.638 align:start position:0%
16 weeks to make money you have to
 
05:18:51.190 --> 05:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
adjust everything you do we've got five
 
05:18:54.868 --> 05:18:54.878 align:start position:0%
lifts we've got 13 compressor 13 pumps
 
05:18:56.390 --> 05:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
in our snow making building with three
 
05:18:59.590 --> 05:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
compressors we have five cats that groom
 
05:19:02.390 --> 05:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
225 acres and no matter how much you
 
05:19:02.400 --> 05:19:03.510 align:start position:0%
225 acres and no matter how much you
plan

05:19:03.510 --> 05:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
plan
 
05:19:05.510 --> 05:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the summers no matter what your plan
 
05:19:07.750 --> 05:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
is in the winters things go wrong and
 
05:19:09.270 --> 05:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
when something goes wrong with one of
 
05:19:11.670 --> 05:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
these pieces of equipment you have to
 
05:19:14.230 --> 05:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
respond immediately i'll get a call at
 
05:19:16.470 --> 05:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
2am and say we just lost a pump in the
 
05:19:18.230 --> 05:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
compressor house which means that our
 
05:19:19.830 --> 05:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
snowmaking capacity is going to be down
 
05:19:23.430 --> 05:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
by 25 or 50 percent my question is do
 
05:19:25.430 --> 05:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
you have it out yet and is it on a truck
 
05:19:27.910 --> 05:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
going somewhere to get repaired because
 
05:19:30.948 --> 05:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
you have no time to be able to make a
 
05:19:32.788 --> 05:19:32.798 align:start position:0%
decision that you have to go talk to
 
05:19:34.310 --> 05:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
somebody i would call the commit
 
05:19:35.670 --> 05:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
chairman of the commission the gun stock
 
05:19:37.590 --> 05:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
area commission and say hey look we lost
 
05:19:39.830 --> 05:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
a pump or we lost a gearbox and a lift
 
05:19:41.750 --> 05:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's out and it's on its way and they
 
05:19:44.390 --> 05:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
say great let us know how it's going
 
05:19:46.868 --> 05:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
we don't sometimes even have it we have
 
05:19:48.550 --> 05:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
a general idea what that's going to cost
 
05:19:50.868 --> 05:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
but we don't have time to be able to go
 
05:19:53.910 --> 05:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
and ask a delegation uh that
 
05:19:55.270 --> 05:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
i don't understand the process i
 
05:19:56.788 --> 05:19:56.798 align:start position:0%
understand it could be seven days before
 
05:19:58.470 --> 05:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
they could call a meeting to have that
 
05:20:00.788 --> 05:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
type of answer we can't afford to have
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
something like that happen we got we're
 
05:20:05.430 --> 05:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
moving we're moving machine we have 51
 
05:20:07.110 --> 05:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
pieces of rolling stock those are things
 
05:20:09.110 --> 05:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
with motors in them that keep things
 
05:20:11.990 --> 05:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
rolling here we have a campsite with 300
 
05:20:13.510 --> 05:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
spots in it so
 
05:20:13.520 --> 05:20:14.628 align:start position:0%
spots in it so
there's

05:20:14.628 --> 05:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:20:16.390 --> 05:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
there's so many things that we have to
 
05:20:18.550 --> 05:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
do quickly and you know what
 
05:20:20.310 --> 05:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
i'm really good at it i was an
 
05:20:22.550 --> 05:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
operations manager at waterville before
 
05:20:24.150 --> 05:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
i became the general manager i know
 
05:20:26.310 --> 05:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
about all the operations at the resort i
 
05:20:27.910 --> 05:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
understand how we do it we've got a
 
05:20:30.150 --> 05:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
great staff for people that do it but
 
05:20:31.750 --> 05:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know equipment failures is part of
 
05:20:33.430 --> 05:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
running the ski area and you got to be
 
05:20:34.868 --> 05:20:34.878 align:start position:0%
able to work fast and you've got to be
 
05:20:36.230 --> 05:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
able to get it done because you don't
 
05:20:38.948 --> 05:20:38.958 align:start position:0%
have time to wait because if you get
 
05:20:41.430 --> 05:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
into a situation where you're out with a
 
05:20:43.430 --> 05:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
pump and your snowmaking system is down
 
05:20:45.190 --> 05:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
or you have a lift that's down for a
 
05:20:47.030 --> 05:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
number of days
 
05:20:49.750 --> 05:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
people notice that it's especially now
 
05:20:52.230 --> 05:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
in in the world of social media you can
 
05:20:54.788 --> 05:20:54.798 align:start position:0%
get vilified and crucified in that
 
05:20:56.868 --> 05:20:56.878 align:start position:0%
situation like that because you're not
 
05:20:58.708 --> 05:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
doing what you need to do we have a lift
 
05:21:00.868 --> 05:21:00.878 align:start position:0%
that goes down we had we lost an
 
05:21:02.868 --> 05:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
emergency brake in one of our main lifts
 
05:21:05.510 --> 05:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
at the top we had to go get it rebuilt
 
05:21:07.110 --> 05:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
in littleton we stayed all night to pull
 
05:21:08.868 --> 05:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
it out we brought it up in littleton we
 
05:21:10.150 --> 05:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
put it back in we got it running the
 
05:21:11.430 --> 05:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
next day
 
05:21:13.110 --> 05:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
people were very annoyed that it was
 
05:21:14.868 --> 05:21:14.878 align:start position:0%
down a day
 
05:21:17.190 --> 05:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
so we need to be able to take a look at
 
05:21:19.990 --> 05:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
this operation and understand that the
 
05:21:22.150 --> 05:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
18 delegates
 
05:21:24.310 --> 05:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
don't know what it takes to run a skier
 
05:21:27.430 --> 05:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
and we can't take time to be able to go
 
05:21:29.110 --> 05:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
and go to them and say
 
05:21:31.830 --> 05:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
um you know by the way we have a problem
 
05:21:33.910 --> 05:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
and we need to get it fixed or i've
 
05:21:36.390 --> 05:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
already taken it there and we budget for
 
05:21:38.708 --> 05:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
repairs but we don't budget for major
 
05:21:38.718 --> 05:21:39.830 align:start position:0%
repairs but we don't budget for major
repairs

05:21:39.830 --> 05:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
repairs
 
05:21:41.990 --> 05:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
and we've done an incredible job great
 
05:21:43.990 --> 05:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
job running this business myself our
 
05:21:45.910 --> 05:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
senior staff
 
05:21:47.830 --> 05:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
all the other managers that are there
 
05:21:49.590 --> 05:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
and one other thing to mention that
 
05:21:51.590 --> 05:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't brought up was we did incentivize
 
05:21:53.990 --> 05:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
our managers the 16 managers they also
 
05:21:56.470 --> 05:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
got uh compensated at the uh at the
 
05:21:58.070 --> 05:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
beginning in fact we
 
05:22:00.390 --> 05:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
we accrued money for them we didn't
 
05:22:01.910 --> 05:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
accrue money for ourselves because we
 
05:22:03.910 --> 05:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
only get rewarded if we beat budget and
 
05:22:05.670 --> 05:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
we beat it by a million dollars last
 
05:22:07.430 --> 05:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
year so
 
05:22:09.750 --> 05:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
i you know i can close this with with
 
05:22:12.070 --> 05:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
this thing it's it's a time sensitive
 
05:22:14.070 --> 05:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
business we can't have 18 people that
 
05:22:15.750 --> 05:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
don't know anything about the business
 
05:22:17.670 --> 05:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
trying to tell us how we have to work it
 
05:22:19.590 --> 05:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
so you know the old saying is it ain't
 
05:22:22.548 --> 05:22:22.558 align:start position:0%
broke don't fix it well my saying is
 
05:22:23.670 --> 05:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:22:25.510 --> 05:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
if it if it
 
05:22:27.270 --> 05:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
if it's running well it's demonstrated
 
05:22:28.948 --> 05:22:28.958 align:start position:0%
by our revenues you guys can look at the
 
05:22:31.750 --> 05:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
financials don't try to change it
 
05:22:33.270 --> 05:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
because that's going to be a problem for
 
05:22:35.830 --> 05:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
us and and we can run this business we
 
05:22:38.310 --> 05:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
can run it successfully there was a
 
05:22:40.310 --> 05:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
point brought up about like i said money
 
05:22:42.310 --> 05:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
that was owed it was 20 years ago i'm
 
05:22:44.150 --> 05:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
not that familiar with it but we've
 
05:22:45.990 --> 05:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
since paid down a lot of bonds we're
 
05:22:47.830 --> 05:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
doing a great job we've put a master
 
05:22:49.830 --> 05:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
plan together to be able to continue to
 
05:22:52.070 --> 05:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
to develop the resort and be able to be
 
05:22:54.788 --> 05:22:54.798 align:start position:0%
competitive in the marketplace um it's a
 
05:22:56.470 --> 05:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
great spot it's a beautiful place if
 
05:22:58.548 --> 05:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
you've never been there it's exceptional
 
05:23:00.948 --> 05:23:00.958 align:start position:0%
and uh we've got a lot of loyal skiers
 
05:23:03.430 --> 05:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
and riders that have written and
 
05:23:05.350 --> 05:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
participated in their displeasure with
 
05:23:07.590 --> 05:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
what potentially could happen so i would
 
05:23:10.708 --> 05:23:10.718 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose uh house bill 1078.
 
05:23:13.750 --> 05:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative
 
05:23:14.948 --> 05:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
05:23:16.628 --> 05:23:16.638 align:start position:0%
thank you well
 
05:23:18.868 --> 05:23:18.878 align:start position:0%
mr dave for taking my question
 
05:23:21.670 --> 05:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going back to your best year
 
05:23:23.910 --> 05:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
that you did it was under a global
 
05:23:23.920 --> 05:23:25.270 align:start position:0%
that you did it was under a global
pandemic

05:23:25.270 --> 05:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
05:23:27.830 --> 05:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
so what was your key to success in terms
 
05:23:27.840 --> 05:23:28.708 align:start position:0%
so what was your key to success in terms
of

05:23:28.708 --> 05:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:23:30.548 --> 05:23:30.558 align:start position:0%
best practices in business and
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
especially in a ski
 
05:23:33.750 --> 05:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
would you say that
 
05:23:35.510 --> 05:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
you put all your
 
05:23:38.310 --> 05:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
talent and your team together
 
05:23:40.390 --> 05:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
and that was your key to success
 
05:23:43.030 --> 05:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
and was that any duplications yes i mean
 
05:23:45.510 --> 05:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
we were in november when we realized
 
05:23:47.430 --> 05:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
well first off i started working january
 
05:23:51.270 --> 05:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
15th of 2020 and march 15th of 2020
 
05:23:53.350 --> 05:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
everything shut down because of covin
 
05:23:55.750 --> 05:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
we had to make a decision to furlough 35
 
05:23:59.270 --> 05:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
of our 65 full-time employees um and and
 
05:24:00.948 --> 05:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
cut back all our summer operations
 
05:24:02.548 --> 05:24:02.558 align:start position:0%
because we knew we couldn't generate the
 
05:24:03.750 --> 05:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
revenue that we needed to and we
 
05:24:07.350 --> 05:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't safely operate with the um best
 
05:24:09.590 --> 05:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
safe of our safety of our staff and of
 
05:24:10.628 --> 05:24:10.638 align:start position:0%
of our
 
05:24:12.548 --> 05:24:12.558 align:start position:0%
of the guests so then when we rolled
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
into november we were like oh my gosh
 
05:24:16.548 --> 05:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
you can't load a quad lift with four
 
05:24:18.548 --> 05:24:18.558 align:start position:0%
people you can't have people that aren't
 
05:24:20.708 --> 05:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
riding in the same party coming together
 
05:24:22.948 --> 05:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
you can't you can have 50 less people in
 
05:24:24.708 --> 05:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
the base lodge for food and reference
 
05:24:27.190 --> 05:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
revenue so we were like
 
05:24:29.270 --> 05:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
we've got to make a bunch of changes so
 
05:24:31.910 --> 05:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
we did we took we got two food trucks in
 
05:24:34.390 --> 05:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
the parking lot and that that took we
 
05:24:35.830 --> 05:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
lost two five hundred thousand dollars
 
05:24:37.510 --> 05:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
in food and beverage we made two hundred
 
05:24:39.270 --> 05:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars on that by doing that
 
05:24:41.030 --> 05:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
we adjusted the way that we loaded the
 
05:24:43.110 --> 05:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
list we adjusted the way we ran our bus
 
05:24:45.110 --> 05:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
systems we stopped taking people to
 
05:24:47.350 --> 05:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
remote lots we made people reserve
 
05:24:49.350 --> 05:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
tickets online which made us understand
 
05:24:51.110 --> 05:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
what our controls were
 
05:24:54.708 --> 05:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
we we had to spend we spent over 150 000
 
05:24:56.548 --> 05:24:56.558 align:start position:0%
and just setting up the way to clean and
 
05:24:58.628 --> 05:24:58.638 align:start position:0%
safely sanitize everything to make sure
 
05:25:00.868 --> 05:25:00.878 align:start position:0%
our staff and guests were safe we
 
05:25:03.190 --> 05:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
constantly ran around trying to adjust
 
05:25:05.510 --> 05:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
every day i was also on the
 
05:25:07.030 --> 05:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
committee for the reopening of the ski
 
05:25:08.470 --> 05:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
areas with the state of new hampshire i
 
05:25:10.150 --> 05:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
was the chair of that so that we could
 
05:25:11.590 --> 05:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
go and speak with the governor and the
 
05:25:13.910 --> 05:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
opening committees and talk about how we
 
05:25:16.708 --> 05:25:16.718 align:start position:0%
can make it work for us so we
 
05:25:18.868 --> 05:25:18.878 align:start position:0%
we that's the thing with this business
 
05:25:20.868 --> 05:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
you don't you don't make a plan and you
 
05:25:22.230 --> 05:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
start at the beginning of the winter you
 
05:25:24.708 --> 05:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
make a plan and every day
 
05:25:26.390 --> 05:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
you have to figure out something else
 
05:25:27.910 --> 05:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
because something's going wrong that
 
05:25:30.390 --> 05:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
year we absolutely adjusted everything
 
05:25:32.628 --> 05:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
we did every day to make it work and we
 
05:25:34.628 --> 05:25:34.638 align:start position:0%
ended up having a successful season and
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
yes people were skiing mid-week because
 
05:25:38.150 --> 05:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
they were able to work remotely from
 
05:25:40.548 --> 05:25:40.558 align:start position:0%
home but then again we found out that we
 
05:25:43.110 --> 05:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
converted so many people that seem to
 
05:25:45.270 --> 05:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
enjoy what gun stock was that our season
 
05:25:47.670 --> 05:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
pass sales are up 30 this year and we
 
05:25:51.030 --> 05:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
are going to have in a non-covered year
 
05:25:58.070 --> 05:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:59.430 --> 05:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:26:01.110 --> 05:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
05:26:04.470 --> 05:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
question kind of commenty um
 
05:26:05.990 --> 05:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
you you said that you have you had to do
 
05:26:08.390 --> 05:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
all these adjustments because of covid
 
05:26:10.230 --> 05:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
um would it be fair to say that you're
 
05:26:12.230 --> 05:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
doing adjustments constantly because you
 
05:26:13.670 --> 05:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
really don't know what level of snow
 
05:26:14.708 --> 05:26:14.718 align:start position:0%
we're going to get and how much you're
 
05:26:16.390 --> 05:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
going to be able to make and when the
 
05:26:17.750 --> 05:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
warm weather is going to come the cold
 
05:26:20.868 --> 05:26:20.878 align:start position:0%
weather or so on so aren't you kind of
 
05:26:21.750 --> 05:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
at the
 
05:26:23.510 --> 05:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
every year making adjustments maybe
 
05:26:26.788 --> 05:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
covered with more extreme but
 
05:26:29.590 --> 05:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
yes i mean it's it's a it's
 
05:26:30.948 --> 05:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
you know it's a tough business when
 
05:26:33.110 --> 05:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
mother nature's your boss but you have
 
05:26:35.430 --> 05:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to adjust every way you can
 
05:26:37.670 --> 05:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
we have we have colored days red blue
 
05:26:39.990 --> 05:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
yellow and green so green blue yellow
 
05:26:42.230 --> 05:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
red that we adjust our staff levels
 
05:26:44.070 --> 05:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
prior on a thursday we have a meeting we
 
05:26:45.990 --> 05:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
look at what we think our budgeted
 
05:26:48.390 --> 05:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
numbers will be if for some reason the
 
05:26:50.548 --> 05:26:50.558 align:start position:0%
weatherman said it's going to be
 
05:26:52.948 --> 05:26:52.958 align:start position:0%
10 below zero or snowing on a saturday
 
05:26:53.990 --> 05:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
we know we're not going to get the
 
05:26:56.070 --> 05:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
people we should we adjust our staffing
 
05:26:59.190 --> 05:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
levels accordingly so it's a like like
 
05:27:01.190 --> 05:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
gary said it's 16 weeks to make money
 
05:27:04.470 --> 05:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
you can't miss a day we have a daily
 
05:27:06.948 --> 05:27:06.958 align:start position:0%
sales and labor report every day
 
05:27:08.628 --> 05:27:08.638 align:start position:0%
they get we get a report that all of our
 
05:27:10.788 --> 05:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
staff managers and senior managers get
 
05:27:12.708 --> 05:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
that shows you what the revenue was from
 
05:27:14.070 --> 05:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
the day before and what the expenses
 
05:27:16.070 --> 05:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
were from the day before by department
 
05:27:17.670 --> 05:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
because you can't wait till the end of
 
05:27:19.110 --> 05:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
the week
 
05:27:20.708 --> 05:27:20.718 align:start position:0%
to take a look at what happened because
 
05:27:22.868 --> 05:27:22.878 align:start position:0%
it's too late
 
05:27:26.470 --> 05:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative power
 
05:27:27.830 --> 05:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:27:30.948 --> 05:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question with regard to the
 
05:27:32.868 --> 05:27:32.878 align:start position:0%
language the the
 
05:27:34.708 --> 05:27:34.718 align:start position:0%
added language in the bill
 
05:27:38.230 --> 05:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
referencing a supplemental appropriation
 
05:27:40.628 --> 05:27:40.638 align:start position:0%
needing to be approved by the county
 
05:27:43.350 --> 05:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
convention do you have any sense as to
 
05:27:45.510 --> 05:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
what the timeline or how long that would
 
05:27:45.520 --> 05:27:46.310 align:start position:0%
what the timeline or how long that would
take

05:27:46.310 --> 05:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
take
 
05:27:49.350 --> 05:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
if you had a supplemental
 
05:27:51.910 --> 05:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation that needed to be approved
 
05:27:51.920 --> 05:27:53.110 align:start position:0%
appropriation that needed to be approved
beyond

05:27:53.110 --> 05:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
05:27:56.070 --> 05:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
the budget that was approved
 
05:27:59.190 --> 05:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
have you gotten any spoken to anybody
 
05:28:01.110 --> 05:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
to get a sense and an understanding as
 
05:28:05.350 --> 05:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:06.548 --> 05:28:06.558 align:start position:0%
well i've
 
05:28:07.910 --> 05:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
it seems like there's a little bit of a
 
05:28:09.670 --> 05:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
moving target on that so i can't answer
 
05:28:11.910 --> 05:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
that totally it doesn't seem like
 
05:28:13.590 --> 05:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
anything could be
 
05:28:15.670 --> 05:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
the way it is now where
 
05:28:18.390 --> 05:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
if we have to move
 
05:28:21.030 --> 05:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
if um if we have to go and like i said
 
05:28:22.548 --> 05:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
have a catastrophic failure where we're
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
going to spend 30 50 000 on something we
 
05:28:27.510 --> 05:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
can go do it i don't think we could with
 
05:28:29.990 --> 05:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
that but i don't know because once again
 
05:28:32.070 --> 05:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of discussion
 
05:28:34.868 --> 05:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
about it i'm not sure i understand
 
05:28:37.190 --> 05:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
it all other than it seems like there is
 
05:28:37.200 --> 05:28:39.270 align:start position:0%
it all other than it seems like there is
more

05:28:39.270 --> 05:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:28:41.110 --> 05:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
unneeded oversight
 
05:28:44.230 --> 05:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
to to delay the opportunities that we
 
05:28:45.910 --> 05:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
have to be able to make adjustments to
 
05:28:48.548 --> 05:28:48.558 align:start position:0%
our business that is really makes a
 
05:28:50.230 --> 05:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
difference because if you start getting
 
05:28:52.310 --> 05:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
a bad rap and social media about lifts
 
05:28:53.990 --> 05:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
not running and snow making not being
 
05:28:55.830 --> 05:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
done because we've got a breakdown that
 
05:28:58.070 --> 05:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
we can't repair you lose customers and
 
05:29:00.948 --> 05:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
after a while you lose them permanently
 
05:29:05.430 --> 05:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:08.628 --> 05:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr day from uh
 
05:29:08.638 --> 05:29:10.070 align:start position:0%

it derives its cash from revenue not
 
05:30:14.948 --> 05:30:14.958 align:start position:0%
from an allocation of tax monies
 
05:30:17.990 --> 05:30:18.000 align:start position:0%

county
 
05:30:21.830 --> 05:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
it is imperative to the success of gun
 
05:30:23.750 --> 05:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
stock that is allowed to continue
 
05:30:26.868 --> 05:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
operating as a business managed by a
 
05:30:29.510 --> 05:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
senior team of professionals with

commission

05:30:34.390 --> 05:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:30:37.430 --> 05:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
gun stock is a complex business we have
 
05:30:41.350 --> 05:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
19 departments and we manage over 500
 
05:30:44.310 --> 05:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
general ledger accounts
 
05:30:46.628 --> 05:30:46.638 align:start position:0%
unlike any government agency these
 
05:30:46.638 --> 05:30:48.070 align:start position:0%
unlike any government agency these
expenses

05:30:48.070 --> 05:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
05:30:50.470 --> 05:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
a majority of the expenses are variable
 
05:30:52.150 --> 05:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
not fixed
 
05:30:54.788 --> 05:30:54.798 align:start position:0%
in addition these expenses have a direct
 
05:30:57.590 --> 05:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
correlation to revenue so
 
05:31:00.150 --> 05:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
to just explain that as our revenue
 
05:31:04.070 --> 05:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
increases we have to spend more money
 
05:31:05.990 --> 05:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
that was not in the budget we have
 
05:31:07.430 --> 05:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
increased labor
 
05:31:10.230 --> 05:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
increase cost of goods so delaying those
 
05:31:10.240 --> 05:31:11.510 align:start position:0%
increase cost of goods so delaying those
decisions

05:31:11.510 --> 05:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
05:31:14.628 --> 05:31:14.638 align:start position:0%
when revenue is growing today and we
 
05:31:17.750 --> 05:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
need to spend cost of goods and labor to
 
05:31:20.548 --> 05:31:20.558 align:start position:0%
capture those revenues
 
05:31:23.430 --> 05:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
we are a business and we need to make
 
05:31:25.910 --> 05:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
those decisions daily
 
05:31:28.708 --> 05:31:28.718 align:start position:0%
uh frequently frequently expenses need
 
05:31:31.910 --> 05:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
to be flexed in response to those daily
 
05:31:34.830 --> 05:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
changes in revenue and unforeseen
 
05:31:37.110 --> 05:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances any delay in those
 
05:31:39.030 --> 05:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
decisions will have immediate and
 
05:31:41.590 --> 05:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
long-term negative financial
 
05:31:41.600 --> 05:31:43.110 align:start position:0%
long-term negative financial
ramifications

05:31:43.110 --> 05:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
ramifications
 
05:31:46.230 --> 05:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
as tom day had stated we look at daily
 
05:31:46.240 --> 05:31:47.350 align:start position:0%
as tom day had stated we look at daily
sales

05:31:47.350 --> 05:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
sales
 
05:31:48.868 --> 05:31:48.878 align:start position:0%
daily labor
 
05:31:51.350 --> 05:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
daily so we can flex
 
05:31:53.350 --> 05:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
every expenditure that we need to make
 
05:31:54.548 --> 05:31:54.558 align:start position:0%
to ensure
 
05:31:57.190 --> 05:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
we're capturing revenue
 
05:31:59.670 --> 05:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
the senior management team presents the
 
05:32:01.910 --> 05:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
operating plan and budget to the gun
 
05:32:04.948 --> 05:32:04.958 align:start position:0%

05:32:12.150 --> 05:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
debt ratios and cash flow and again
 
05:32:12.160 --> 05:32:13.830 align:start position:0%
debt ratios and cash flow and again
unlike

05:32:13.830 --> 05:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
unlike
 
05:32:16.310 --> 05:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
the shares department we operate
 
05:32:18.628 --> 05:32:18.638 align:start position:0%
strictly on cash flow
 
05:32:21.270 --> 05:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
we do not operate our business on
 
05:32:21.280 --> 05:32:22.628 align:start position:0%
we do not operate our business on
approved

05:32:22.628 --> 05:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
approved
 
05:32:26.470 --> 05:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
budget expenditures our business is run
 
05:32:28.948 --> 05:32:28.958 align:start position:0%
on cash flow that means
 
05:32:30.310 --> 05:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
in a year
 
05:32:32.470 --> 05:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
off our budget we know what we're going
 
05:32:35.910 --> 05:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
to have available for cash and based on
 
05:32:37.430 --> 05:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
that cash
 
05:32:39.830 --> 05:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
we make decisions so we flex those
 
05:32:41.590 --> 05:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
decisions to either
 
05:32:44.628 --> 05:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
increase business decrease business
 
05:32:47.510 --> 05:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
close summer operations because of covid
 
05:32:50.310 --> 05:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
where we afraid we we ran the numbers
 
05:32:52.948 --> 05:32:52.958 align:start position:0%
that we would lose more money than
 
05:32:56.868 --> 05:32:56.878 align:start position:0%
making so this is not a static operation
 
05:32:58.788 --> 05:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
that your budget set
 
05:33:02.390 --> 05:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
we move on we're changing daily we run
 
05:33:06.628 --> 05:33:06.638 align:start position:0%
off of cash flow so we don't get any ppa
 
05:33:09.190 --> 05:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
money we don't get any government money
 
05:33:11.510 --> 05:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
we don't get anything from the county
 
05:33:16.150 --> 05:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
we did in fact in 22 years ago we did
 
05:33:18.548 --> 05:33:18.558 align:start position:0%
have the county step in and take over
 
05:33:21.350 --> 05:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
some of our bonds but again that was 22
 
05:33:22.628 --> 05:33:22.638 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
05:33:24.788 --> 05:33:24.798 align:start position:0%
since then we have gone to the
 
05:33:27.350 --> 05:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
delegation and received approval for
 
05:33:29.990 --> 05:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
over 10 million dollars in additional
 
05:33:33.750 --> 05:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
bonds since that 2000 that was money
 
05:33:36.868 --> 05:33:36.878 align:start position:0%
spent to generate revenue
 
05:33:39.910 --> 05:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
summer attractions repairs maintenance
 
05:33:41.670 --> 05:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
on a few various things
 
05:33:45.110 --> 05:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
we paid those bonds back we have made
 
05:33:47.430 --> 05:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
payments to those bonds
 
05:33:50.230 --> 05:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
out of business reasons
 
05:33:52.310 --> 05:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
the budget is proved by the commission
 
05:33:55.270 --> 05:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
and truly serves as a blueprint
 
05:33:57.590 --> 05:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
for operations the senior team must
 
05:33:59.670 --> 05:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
continue to have authority to adjust
 
05:34:03.350 --> 05:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
expenses to keep the business running
 
05:34:06.948 --> 05:34:06.958 align:start position:0%
while keeping overall ebitda cash flow
 
05:34:09.430 --> 05:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
in the forefront so everything we do
 
05:34:11.750 --> 05:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
every decision we made
 
05:34:14.628 --> 05:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
every decision we make is always focused
 
05:34:17.590 --> 05:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
on cash flow how much cash do we have
 
05:34:19.590 --> 05:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
how much cash we're going to have for
 
05:34:21.190 --> 05:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
our expenses how much are we going to
 
05:34:23.510 --> 05:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
have for capital expenditures where do
 
05:34:26.150 --> 05:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
we get bonds where do we do cap leasing
 
05:34:29.190 --> 05:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
all those decisions are done daily
 
05:34:31.990 --> 05:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
gun stock relies on the industry experts
 
05:34:34.948 --> 05:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
and business professionals it employs
 
05:34:40.708 --> 05:34:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:43.110 --> 05:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
over 25 000
 
05:34:45.270 --> 05:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
are discussed and presented to the
 
05:34:47.750 --> 05:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner and chairman depending on
 
05:34:47.760 --> 05:34:48.788 align:start position:0%
commissioner and chairman depending on
timing

05:34:48.788 --> 05:34:48.798 align:start position:0%
timing
 
05:34:50.948 --> 05:34:50.958 align:start position:0%
turning budgetary control over to an
 
05:34:54.150 --> 05:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
18-person delegation who do not actively
 
05:34:56.150 --> 05:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
oversee complex
 
05:34:58.868 --> 05:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
revenue driven businesses would be
 
05:35:01.030 --> 05:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
devastating to gun stock
 
05:35:02.470 --> 05:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
the current structure allows for
 
05:35:04.628 --> 05:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
financial flexibility
 
05:35:06.948 --> 05:35:06.958 align:start position:0%
that flexibility is a key component to a
 
05:35:08.868 --> 05:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
successful business
 
05:35:11.350 --> 05:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
delayed decision making and politically
 
05:35:14.270 --> 05:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
driven agendas do not provide financial
 
05:35:17.270 --> 05:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility and accountability to the
 
05:35:20.548 --> 05:35:20.558 align:start position:0%

05:35:34.390 --> 05:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis to the commissioners
 
05:35:37.110 --> 05:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
and these are also available online and
 
05:35:40.708 --> 05:35:40.718 align:start position:0%
these are also sent to the delegation so
 
05:35:42.470 --> 05:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
this breaks down
 
05:35:45.510 --> 05:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
all 19 departments what our cash flow is
 
05:35:47.670 --> 05:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
what we've spent money on and then we
 
05:35:50.150 --> 05:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
also discuss what's our plan each and
 
05:35:52.230 --> 05:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
coming month of the future of the
 
05:35:53.590 --> 05:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
business could you give those to
 
05:35:55.030 --> 05:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative power and she'll pass
 
05:35:58.070 --> 05:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:00.230 --> 05:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
and catherine did you say your title was
 
05:36:01.910 --> 05:36:01.920 align:start position:0%

correct

05:36:03.030 --> 05:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:36:07.990 --> 05:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:09.670 --> 05:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
other questions for
 
05:36:11.030 --> 05:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
the chief financial officer yes
 
05:36:11.040 --> 05:36:12.868 align:start position:0%
the chief financial officer yes
representative

05:36:12.868 --> 05:36:12.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:36:14.390 --> 05:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:36:18.310 --> 05:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:20.070 --> 05:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
i'd uh i'd like to ask what the
 
05:36:22.628 --> 05:36:22.638 align:start position:0%
rationale behind getting a capital lease
 
05:36:24.310 --> 05:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
be versus uh
 
05:36:27.030 --> 05:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
getting a uh a bond other than uh
 
05:36:29.990 --> 05:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh having the bond approved by the
 
05:36:31.750 --> 05:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
county convention would be
 
05:36:34.390 --> 05:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
actually in business capital leases are
 
05:36:36.470 --> 05:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
usually for assets that are less than
 
05:36:39.510 --> 05:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
five years where bonds are usually that
 
05:36:42.948 --> 05:36:42.958 align:start position:0%
exceed 10 15 and 20 years so in in
 
05:36:42.958 --> 05:36:44.788 align:start position:0%
exceed 10 15 and 20 years so in in
accounting

05:36:44.788 --> 05:36:44.798 align:start position:0%
accounting
 
05:36:46.470 --> 05:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
you'll usually take a cap
 
05:36:49.190 --> 05:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
cap lease for a short term asset less
 
05:36:51.670 --> 05:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
than five years and then we would bond
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
something that's 10 15 20 years
 
05:36:58.470 --> 05:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:37:01.110 --> 05:37:01.120 align:start position:0%

05:37:06.708 --> 05:37:06.718 align:start position:0%
believe that your business the
 
05:37:08.868 --> 05:37:08.878 align:start position:0%
gun stock ski area
 
05:37:11.830 --> 05:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
is one of the prime businesses for new
 
05:37:13.910 --> 05:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire which is tourism and
 
05:37:17.030 --> 05:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
entertainment is that uh outdoor would
 
05:37:19.510 --> 05:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
you believe that yes i would
 
05:37:22.310 --> 05:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay and what is your follow-up just a
 
05:37:24.310 --> 05:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
 
05:37:29.190 --> 05:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh what is your you know how many uh
 
05:37:31.990 --> 05:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
ski areas and what percentage of that is
 
05:37:34.628 --> 05:37:34.638 align:start position:0%
a big gun stock can you repeat that i
 
05:37:36.788 --> 05:37:36.798 align:start position:0%
said in new hampshire we have several
 
05:37:39.830 --> 05:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's our crown jewel in terms of ski
 
05:37:42.470 --> 05:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
areas and outdoor activities and so
 
05:37:44.708 --> 05:37:44.718 align:start position:0%
would you say it's one of the top ten or
 
05:37:47.110 --> 05:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
one of the top five in the state
 
05:37:48.868 --> 05:37:48.878 align:start position:0%
i'd like to believe it's one of the best
 
05:37:48.878 --> 05:37:49.830 align:start position:0%
i'd like to believe it's one of the best
yes

05:37:49.830 --> 05:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:37:52.788 --> 05:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:56.628 --> 05:37:56.638 align:start position:0%

help me with that
buzzword

05:38:10.548 --> 05:38:10.558 align:start position:0%
buzzword
 
05:38:12.390 --> 05:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
mr chair committee i'm going to make it
 
05:38:13.830 --> 05:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
real brief because a lot has been said
 
05:38:15.350 --> 05:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to cover
 
05:38:18.150 --> 05:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
okay first of all i am a taxpayer of
 
05:38:19.750 --> 05:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
belknap county i'm one of the ones
 
05:38:22.310 --> 05:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's of the 3 000 signatures that were
 
05:38:25.190 --> 05:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
put on the petition there to stop this
 
05:38:25.200 --> 05:38:26.390 align:start position:0%
put on the petition there to stop this
nonsense

05:38:26.390 --> 05:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
nonsense
 
05:38:29.030 --> 05:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
i'm really disturbed by it and i wonder
 
05:38:31.190 --> 05:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
if uh the people who are on the
 
05:38:34.150 --> 05:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
delegation had ran on the platform of
 
05:38:36.788 --> 05:38:36.798 align:start position:0%
taking over the finances of gun stock if
 
05:38:38.868 --> 05:38:38.878 align:start position:0%
they'd be sitting here today
 
05:38:40.868 --> 05:38:40.878 align:start position:0%
now unlike well let's say i'm not in the
 
05:38:42.788 --> 05:38:42.798 align:start position:0%
class of rusty
 
05:38:44.868 --> 05:38:44.878 align:start position:0%
or mr condition in terms of
 
05:38:47.270 --> 05:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
business but i actually
 
05:38:49.670 --> 05:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
was a two environmental consulting
 
05:38:51.830 --> 05:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
companies in new hampshire i was chief
 
05:38:54.070 --> 05:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
operations officer and chief executive
 
05:38:57.190 --> 05:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
officer for over 25 years our
 
05:38:59.670 --> 05:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
gross revenue was on the same level as
 
05:39:00.948 --> 05:39:00.958 align:start position:0%
gun stock
 
05:39:03.110 --> 05:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
number of employees about the same
 
05:39:05.030 --> 05:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
we had a great board of directors that
 
05:39:07.270 --> 05:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
helped us making make strategic
 
05:39:09.590 --> 05:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
decisions on things
 
05:39:11.910 --> 05:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
strangely we did not have an 18 member
 
05:39:13.670 --> 05:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
committee that second guessed everything
 
05:39:16.708 --> 05:39:16.718 align:start position:0%
we'd decided we wanted to do and i think
 
05:39:18.948 --> 05:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
this is what we're getting to here
 
05:39:18.958 --> 05:39:19.830 align:start position:0%
this is what we're getting to here
now

05:39:19.830 --> 05:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:39:21.750 --> 05:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things i want to mention that
 
05:39:23.670 --> 05:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
sort of illustrates what i would
 
05:39:26.470 --> 05:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
consider the naivety of the delegation
 
05:39:28.868 --> 05:39:28.878 align:start position:0%
they've met made such a point of the
 
05:39:30.868 --> 05:39:30.878 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand hundred thousand
 
05:39:33.190 --> 05:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
dollars in bonuses
 
05:39:35.110 --> 05:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
as someone testified to earlier this is
 
05:39:37.110 --> 05:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
the way business operates that's how you
 
05:39:39.270 --> 05:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
keep people on board that's how you
 
05:39:41.590 --> 05:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
incentivize it in our business we gave
 
05:39:43.590 --> 05:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
over two hundred thousand dollars a year
 
05:39:47.030 --> 05:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
we had merit plans for achieving certain
 
05:39:48.708 --> 05:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
profits in their business sectors and
 
05:39:50.150 --> 05:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
05:39:50.160 --> 05:39:52.150 align:start position:0%
things like that
so

05:39:52.150 --> 05:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:39:54.708 --> 05:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
i'm going to conclude by saying
 
05:39:54.718 --> 05:39:56.150 align:start position:0%
i'm going to conclude by saying
please

05:39:56.150 --> 05:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:39:58.868 --> 05:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
vote on this as inexpedient to legislate
 
05:40:01.110 --> 05:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i have copies
 
05:40:02.948 --> 05:40:02.958 align:start position:0%

it thank you if you give them to
 
05:40:06.628 --> 05:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
representative power on the end
 
05:40:09.110 --> 05:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
she'll pass them around
 
05:40:10.788 --> 05:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
next we have
 
05:40:17.190 --> 05:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:19.990 --> 05:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
welcome brian i just asked you to
 
05:40:21.590 --> 05:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
please be aware of the clock that we're
 
05:40:25.510 --> 05:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
trying to manage somewhat unsuccessfully
 
05:40:28.150 --> 05:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
i shall mr chair and thank you very much
 
05:40:29.910 --> 05:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
chairman dolan and the committee for the
 
05:40:31.750 --> 05:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share a few words with
 
05:40:33.270 --> 05:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
you today
 
05:40:36.788 --> 05:40:36.798 align:start position:0%
i come before you to strongly oppose
 
05:40:40.628 --> 05:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
house bill 1078 and i ask this committee
 
05:40:42.948 --> 05:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
to vote this bill in expedia to
 
05:40:42.958 --> 05:40:44.868 align:start position:0%
to vote this bill in expedia to
legislate

05:40:44.868 --> 05:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
05:40:49.030 --> 05:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
as you have done in 2018
 
05:40:51.910 --> 05:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
when house bill 1702
 
05:40:54.868 --> 05:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
which was probably the cousin of this
 
05:40:56.548 --> 05:40:56.558 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
05:40:58.310 --> 05:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
was voted out of this committee in
 
05:41:01.190 --> 05:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate unanimously on a
 
05:41:04.788 --> 05:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
vote of 13 to zero i went back to the
 
05:41:07.990 --> 05:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
house record in 2018 and i'd like to
 
05:41:10.230 --> 05:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
read the blurb that your representative
 
05:41:10.240 --> 05:41:11.270 align:start position:0%
read the blurb that your representative
wrote

05:41:11.270 --> 05:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
wrote
 
05:41:13.590 --> 05:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
for that particular house bill
 
05:41:15.430 --> 05:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
and she said this bill
 
05:41:18.070 --> 05:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 1702 was drafted would
 
05:41:20.708 --> 05:41:20.718 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the future of gun stock and
 
05:41:23.110 --> 05:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
would give the belknap county convention
 
05:41:24.868 --> 05:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
authority to control gun stock's
 
05:41:24.878 --> 05:41:26.230 align:start position:0%
authority to control gun stock's
finances

05:41:26.230 --> 05:41:26.240 align:start position:0%

05:42:09.830 --> 05:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
waste of your time
 
05:42:11.830 --> 05:42:11.840 align:start position:0%

05:42:16.868 --> 05:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
what you need to know
 
05:42:17.910 --> 05:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:42:20.470 --> 05:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor and co-sponsors of
 
05:42:22.070 --> 05:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
05:42:23.750 --> 05:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
are a group of folks
 
05:42:25.270 --> 05:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
that never
 
05:42:27.110 --> 05:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
came before the gun stock area
 
05:42:29.190 --> 05:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
commissioners to let them know that they
 
05:42:31.190 --> 05:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
were filing legislation
 
05:42:33.750 --> 05:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
and since that has occurred they have
 
05:42:35.910 --> 05:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
not had the common courtesy to come
 
05:42:38.230 --> 05:42:38.240 align:start position:0%

05:42:47.830 --> 05:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
from previous legislation two years ago
 
05:42:50.150 --> 05:42:50.160 align:start position:0%

better clients in in seeking

hidden

05:44:38.948 --> 05:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
hidden
 
05:44:42.070 --> 05:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
and what i have found difficult to
 
05:44:44.150 --> 05:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
understand is the
 
05:44:46.230 --> 05:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
folks that represent
 
05:44:48.788 --> 05:44:48.798 align:start position:0%

05:44:51.430 --> 05:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
behind the word transparency
 
05:44:54.948 --> 05:44:54.958 align:start position:0%

another level of bureaucracy in

gunstock mountain resort in in just
 
05:47:07.190 --> 05:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
mr chair as a a side note
 
05:47:09.430 --> 05:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
having had the opportunity to serve as
 
05:47:11.590 --> 05:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
as you folks in the legislature when i
 
05:47:13.190 --> 05:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
was assigned to the ways and means
 
05:47:15.030 --> 05:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
committee under
 
05:47:17.030 --> 05:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
chairman major and vice chairman of
 
05:47:17.040 --> 05:47:18.150 align:start position:0%
chairman major and vice chairman of
romney

05:47:18.150 --> 05:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
romney
 
05:47:20.628 --> 05:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
i learned very quickly what
 
05:47:22.470 --> 05:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
good legislation is
 
05:47:25.350 --> 05:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
and what poor legislation is
 
05:47:27.430 --> 05:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
i submit to you today
 
05:47:29.270 --> 05:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
this does not fall in the category of
 
05:47:32.548 --> 05:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
good legislation in the best remedy for
 
05:47:35.190 --> 05:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
this committee would be to simply uh
 
05:47:37.910 --> 05:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
avoid it and expedient to legislate and
 
05:47:40.070 --> 05:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh everyone can sort of go home
 
05:47:41.670 --> 05:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your service as a
 
05:47:45.430 --> 05:47:45.440 align:start position:0%

05:47:45.440 --> 05:47:46.310 align:start position:0%
legislator are there any questions

and thank you for taking my question you
 
05:47:54.230 --> 05:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
had referenced a house bill you said two
 
05:47:56.150 --> 05:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
years ago so i assume that might be
 
05:47:58.230 --> 05:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
2020. do you have the house bill number
 
05:48:00.310 --> 05:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
for reference uh yes it's house bill
 
05:48:00.320 --> 05:48:02.390 align:start position:0%
for reference uh yes it's house bill
1702

05:48:02.390 --> 05:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
1702
 
05:48:05.670 --> 05:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
and i can leave with you the copy of the
 
05:48:08.230 --> 05:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
house record on the disposition of that
 
05:48:08.240 --> 05:48:09.190 align:start position:0%
house record on the disposition of that
bill

05:48:09.190 --> 05:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:48:09.200 --> 05:48:10.070 align:start position:0%
bill
up

05:48:10.070 --> 05:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:48:12.310 --> 05:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you yeah i i did note
 
05:48:14.230 --> 05:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
that but i thought in your testimony you
 
05:48:17.670 --> 05:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
referenced a bill two years ago which i
 
05:48:19.670 --> 05:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
would be 2020 am i
 
05:48:22.310 --> 05:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding no i i think i may have
 
05:48:24.070 --> 05:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
spoken too quickly the
 
05:48:26.310 --> 05:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
the the bill two years ago was house
 
05:48:28.230 --> 05:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
bill 1442
 
05:48:29.910 --> 05:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
and in that bill
 
05:48:32.230 --> 05:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
the gun stock commissioners and four of
 
05:48:33.830 --> 05:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
the representatives which are different
 
05:48:35.910 --> 05:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
than the representatives here today
 
05:48:38.470 --> 05:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh sat down and cooperatively made some
 
05:48:38.480 --> 05:48:39.830 align:start position:0%
uh sat down and cooperatively made some
changes

05:48:39.830 --> 05:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
changes
 
05:48:41.750 --> 05:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of gunstock mountain
 
05:48:45.030 --> 05:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
resort and for belknap county residents
 
05:48:46.548 --> 05:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
thank you and could you repeat your name
 
05:48:49.590 --> 05:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
i didn't get that brian gallagher
 
05:48:51.750 --> 05:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
and i noticed representative gallagher
 
05:48:53.190 --> 05:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
whose name is
 
05:48:56.390 --> 05:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
eric happens to be uh the same name as
 
05:48:59.110 --> 05:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
my son but not the same family
 
05:49:00.230 --> 05:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
05:49:03.030 --> 05:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
i i'd just like to point out that um we
 
05:49:05.430 --> 05:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
spell our last names differently his has
 
05:49:08.070 --> 05:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
the h and mine doesn't so that's how you
 
05:49:09.990 --> 05:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
can tell the difference difference
 
05:49:11.590 --> 05:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
between them
 
05:49:13.430 --> 05:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
05:49:15.750 --> 05:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
05:49:17.270 --> 05:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:49:19.270 --> 05:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:49:21.190 --> 05:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
i believe it's been uh mentioned a
 
05:49:23.910 --> 05:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
couple times that there are other uh
 
05:49:26.548 --> 05:49:26.558 align:start position:0%
ski areas in this state that are in the
 
05:49:26.558 --> 05:49:27.510 align:start position:0%
ski areas in this state that are in the
same

05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
same
 
05:49:29.510 --> 05:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
in that are state-owned but uh
 
05:49:32.868 --> 05:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:34.548 --> 05:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
the bill that you're suggesting that we
 
05:49:34.558 --> 05:49:35.910 align:start position:0%
the bill that you're suggesting that we
uh

05:49:35.910 --> 05:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:49:35.920 --> 05:49:37.270 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

05:49:37.270 --> 05:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:49:40.788 --> 05:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
pursue to separate the uh
 
05:49:43.190 --> 05:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
the gun stock from the the county would
 
05:49:44.708 --> 05:49:44.718 align:start position:0%
it be something that's similar to what
 
05:49:46.390 --> 05:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
already exists
 
05:49:48.390 --> 05:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative tripp for
 
05:49:51.510 --> 05:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
the uh for the question um it's it's an
 
05:49:53.590 --> 05:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
idea to begin with
 
05:49:56.948 --> 05:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
um those other ski areas possibly could
 
05:49:59.670 --> 05:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
be used as a model to create some
 
05:50:01.190 --> 05:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
language but
 
05:50:04.310 --> 05:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
the thought here is to allow gunstock
 
05:50:07.670 --> 05:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
which is a successful business operation
 
05:50:10.150 --> 05:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
to be separated from
 
05:50:12.788 --> 05:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
the attempted
 
05:50:15.750 --> 05:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
overtaking and the attempted budget
 
05:50:17.830 --> 05:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
control from the belknap county
 
05:50:20.230 --> 05:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
delegation so the thought would be in a
 
05:50:23.190 --> 05:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
future session that possibly a friendly
 
05:50:25.830 --> 05:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
legislator would come forward and say
 
05:50:27.910 --> 05:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
well let's look at the history of this
 
05:50:27.920 --> 05:50:29.110 align:start position:0%
well let's look at the history of this
operation

05:50:29.110 --> 05:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
operation
 
05:50:31.990 --> 05:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
let's look at who the owners are
 
05:50:34.628 --> 05:50:34.638 align:start position:0%
and let's get the politics out of it
 
05:50:36.948 --> 05:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
once and for all
 
05:50:39.590 --> 05:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:50:41.750 --> 05:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you mr gallagher for
 
05:50:45.830 --> 05:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question so would you
 
05:50:48.470 --> 05:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
05:50:50.310 --> 05:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
working cooperatively with the
 
05:50:52.628 --> 05:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
legislation and keeping the business
 
05:50:55.750 --> 05:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
independent would be a win-win
 
05:50:57.590 --> 05:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
that has a very good opportunity
 
05:50:59.750 --> 05:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
represented to be a win-win
 
05:51:02.390 --> 05:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
the the difficulty with
 
05:51:02.400 --> 05:51:03.990 align:start position:0%
the the difficulty with
the

05:51:03.990 --> 05:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:51:06.948 --> 05:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
legislators trying to become part of the
 
05:51:09.788 --> 05:51:09.798 align:start position:0%
business especially without the
 
05:51:12.470 --> 05:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
understanding of what it takes as miss
 
05:51:16.310 --> 05:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
white has as outlined is a is a recipe
 
05:51:19.030 --> 05:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
for failure and it's a recipe to
 
05:51:21.590 --> 05:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
to harm the business and to harm the
 
05:51:23.510 --> 05:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and the residents of belknap
 
05:51:23.520 --> 05:51:24.390 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and the residents of belknap
county

05:51:24.390 --> 05:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
county
 
05:51:24.400 --> 05:51:26.390 align:start position:0%
county
one

05:51:26.390 --> 05:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:51:30.548 --> 05:51:30.558 align:start position:0%
um having served as a rep representative
 
05:51:32.470 --> 05:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
in your earlier days
 
05:51:36.548 --> 05:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
uh would it be an opportunity to
 
05:51:38.948 --> 05:51:38.958 align:start position:0%
turn this into an amendment which would
 
05:51:41.110 --> 05:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
make just do that
 
05:51:44.230 --> 05:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
or is the time is not the right time i i
 
05:51:45.910 --> 05:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
think the latter part of his statement
 
05:51:48.868 --> 05:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
is best i think it's best for this
 
05:51:48.878 --> 05:51:49.990 align:start position:0%
is best i think it's best for this
committee

05:51:49.990 --> 05:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:51:52.150 --> 05:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
to first make a decision on this bill
 
05:51:54.390 --> 05:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
and i would hope that you would
 
05:51:57.110 --> 05:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
consider making it go away
 
05:51:59.030 --> 05:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
and i think then it would be important
 
05:52:01.430 --> 05:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
for the gun stock commissioners to spend
 
05:52:03.590 --> 05:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
some time and
 
05:52:06.150 --> 05:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
do a business plan to methodically come
 
05:52:08.548 --> 05:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
05:52:12.548 --> 05:52:12.558 align:start position:0%
responsible legislation say next fall
 
05:52:15.350 --> 05:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
and when we enter into the new session
 
05:52:17.030 --> 05:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
have a bill that they could come back
 
05:52:19.270 --> 05:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
here having done research
 
05:52:19.280 --> 05:52:20.150 align:start position:0%
here having done research
and

05:52:20.150 --> 05:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:52:22.390 --> 05:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
show the committee the results of
 
05:52:24.310 --> 05:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
another year and also
 
05:52:26.470 --> 05:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
show them the work of methodically
 
05:52:27.670 --> 05:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
05:52:30.470 --> 05:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
accomplish the best for the ski resort
 
05:52:33.510 --> 05:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
versus uh doing something too quickly
 
05:52:37.110 --> 05:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
and making mistakes thank you very much
 
05:52:38.948 --> 05:52:38.958 align:start position:0%

the patience
 
05:52:51.030 --> 05:52:51.040 align:start position:0%

over time things change
 
05:54:50.230 --> 05:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
and like all good legislation
 
05:54:52.548 --> 05:54:52.558 align:start position:0%

and that the objectives
 
05:55:02.628 --> 05:55:02.638 align:start position:0%

over its history gun stock has had some
 
05:55:06.390 --> 05:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
challenging times
 
05:55:09.190 --> 05:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
in 1963 chapter
 
05:55:11.270 --> 05:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
44 6
 
05:55:14.788 --> 05:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
was enacted to address real estate taxes
 
05:55:18.230 --> 05:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
in 1990 chapter 144 was
 
05:55:20.788 --> 05:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
enacted to address water extraction for
 
05:55:23.030 --> 05:55:23.040 align:start position:0%

05:55:25.910 --> 05:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
amendments to the 399 statute over the

amendments to the 399 statute over the
years

05:55:27.190 --> 05:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:55:31.110 --> 05:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
in 2001 a memorandum of agreement was
 
05:55:32.788 --> 05:55:32.798 align:start position:0%
created between the
 
05:55:34.708 --> 05:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
gun stock area commission
 
05:55:35.750 --> 05:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:55:37.670 --> 05:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
county delegation
 
05:55:40.070 --> 05:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
this was unique to gun stock and was put
 
05:55:43.590 --> 05:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
in place to facilitate gun stock from
 
05:55:47.110 --> 05:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:49.270 --> 05:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
this was based on two study committee
 
05:55:54.628 --> 05:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
findings and recommendations one in 1991
 
05:55:57.590 --> 05:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:57.600 --> 05:55:59.670 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:55:59.670 --> 05:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:56:03.670 --> 05:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry by the rkg group
 
05:56:06.628 --> 05:56:06.638 align:start position:0%
and the second was in 1999
 
05:56:10.070 --> 05:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
by the gun stock area task force
 
05:56:13.190 --> 05:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
in the moa section 3
 
05:56:15.830 --> 05:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
added a requirement that gun stock
 
05:56:15.840 --> 05:56:17.350 align:start position:0%
added a requirement that gun stock
budget

05:56:17.350 --> 05:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
budget
 
05:56:19.430 --> 05:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
and reporter financial status be
 
05:56:21.190 --> 05:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
presented annually
 
05:56:24.548 --> 05:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:28.470 --> 05:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
in 2017 the moa was not renewed in
 
05:56:28.480 --> 05:56:30.070 align:start position:0%
in 2017 the moa was not renewed in
negotiations

05:56:30.070 --> 05:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
05:56:32.830 --> 05:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
as a result of that failure house bill
 
05:56:32.840 --> 05:56:34.390 align:start position:0%
as a result of that failure house bill
1442

05:56:34.390 --> 05:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
1442
 
05:56:36.628 --> 05:56:36.638 align:start position:0%
that you heard about recently
 
05:56:39.910 --> 05:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
was introduced in january of 2020
 
05:56:41.750 --> 05:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
and was signed into law
 
05:56:43.310 --> 05:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
house bill 40
 
05:56:43.320 --> 05:56:44.948 align:start position:0%
house bill 40
1442

05:56:44.948 --> 05:56:44.958 align:start position:0%
1442
 
05:56:47.990 --> 05:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
made some changes to chapter 399 that
 
05:56:51.750 --> 05:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
eliminated the need for a future moa
 
05:56:55.110 --> 05:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
one thing that was not addressed in 1442
 
05:56:57.270 --> 05:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
was making the requirement of having an
 
05:57:00.070 --> 05:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
annual budget presentation
 
05:57:02.470 --> 05:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
at the same time as the annual report as
 
05:57:06.150 --> 05:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
required in 399 semicolon 14
 
05:57:10.150 --> 05:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
appropriations and revenues part f
 
05:57:12.470 --> 05:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
during the time of the written budget
 
05:57:14.868 --> 05:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
was in place under the moa
 
05:57:17.430 --> 05:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
it created no issues
 
05:57:19.510 --> 05:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
i believe a
 
05:57:21.750 --> 05:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
presented and approved budget by the
 
05:57:24.788 --> 05:57:24.798 align:start position:0%
county gun stock area commission
 
05:57:27.270 --> 05:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
is essential to the transparency of good
 
05:57:27.280 --> 05:57:29.030 align:start position:0%
is essential to the transparency of good
government

05:57:29.030 --> 05:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:57:31.110 --> 05:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
and before i conclude i would like to
 
05:57:32.788 --> 05:57:32.798 align:start position:0%
address a couple of statements that were
 
05:57:34.708 --> 05:57:34.718 align:start position:0%
made today
 
05:57:34.718 --> 05:57:37.590 align:start position:0%
made today
um

05:57:37.590 --> 05:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:40.390 --> 05:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
is fire is selling or leasing if you
 
05:57:42.310 --> 05:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
look in 399
 
05:57:45.670 --> 05:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
semicolon 10 f
 
05:57:48.150 --> 05:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
it's very specific that only that can
 
05:57:50.150 --> 05:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
only happen
 
05:57:50.160 --> 05:57:51.510 align:start position:0%
only happen
under

05:57:51.510 --> 05:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
under
 
05:57:54.868 --> 05:57:54.878 align:start position:0%
a unanimous or a majority vote of both
 
05:57:56.788 --> 05:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
the county commissioners
 
05:57:59.750 --> 05:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
the county delegation
 
05:58:03.190 --> 05:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
and the gun stock area commissioners
 
05:58:05.110 --> 05:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
and also there was uh
 
05:58:07.670 --> 05:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
a mention about who owned gun stock to
 
05:58:09.110 --> 05:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
begin with well
 
05:58:11.910 --> 05:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's always been owned by gun stock i
 
05:58:14.868 --> 05:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
mean by the county of belknap
 
05:58:17.750 --> 05:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
and if you look in the enabling statute
 
05:58:21.190 --> 05:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
of 399 semicolon 18
 
05:58:23.350 --> 05:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's it specifies that when the
 
05:58:26.070 --> 05:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
commission is created all the funds that
 
05:58:27.830 --> 05:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
the county holds
 
05:58:31.030 --> 05:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
will be turned over to the commission
 
05:58:33.590 --> 05:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion i support fort
 
05:58:34.788 --> 05:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
05:58:34.798 --> 05:58:36.628 align:start position:0%
house bill
1078

05:58:36.628 --> 05:58:36.638 align:start position:0%
1078
 
05:58:39.510 --> 05:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
or an amended
 
05:58:41.030 --> 05:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
version of the bill
 
05:58:43.670 --> 05:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
that will require the gac to
 
05:58:43.680 --> 05:58:45.190 align:start position:0%
that will require the gac to
present

05:58:45.190 --> 05:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
present
 
05:58:47.910 --> 05:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
a complete budget of expenditures
 
05:58:47.920 --> 05:58:49.510 align:start position:0%
a complete budget of expenditures
receipts

05:58:49.510 --> 05:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
receipts
 
05:58:49.520 --> 05:58:51.350 align:start position:0%
receipts
and

05:58:51.350 --> 05:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:58:53.830 --> 05:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
in the in the current fiscal year as
 
05:58:56.070 --> 05:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
required in 399
 
05:58:59.110 --> 05:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
semicolon 14
 
05:59:03.270 --> 05:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:04.788 --> 05:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:59:06.948 --> 05:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
you know this is something that i really
 
05:59:09.430 --> 05:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
believe that needs to be
 
05:59:12.548 --> 05:59:12.558 align:start position:0%
brought forward because
 
05:59:16.390 --> 05:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
in the past where there was no oversight
 
05:59:18.470 --> 05:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
gun stock ran into trouble
 
05:59:20.868 --> 05:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
and it was the taxpayers that had to
 
05:59:23.510 --> 05:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
foot the bill to eliminate
 
05:59:26.390 --> 05:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
that default of gun stock and we don't
 
05:59:28.150 --> 05:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
want to see that happening again in the
 
05:59:28.160 --> 05:59:29.350 align:start position:0%
want to see that happening again in the
future

05:59:29.350 --> 05:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:59:32.390 --> 05:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
and the best way to keep an eye on the
 
05:59:34.868 --> 05:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
prize so to speak and it is a prize we
 
05:59:37.830 --> 05:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
love gun stock there's no no one that
 
05:59:40.230 --> 05:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
really wants to sell or well we can't
 
05:59:43.270 --> 05:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
sell it two study committees has shown
 
05:59:45.670 --> 05:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
that but we don't want to lease it we
 
05:59:47.510 --> 05:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
just want to know
 
05:59:49.990 --> 05:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
what is their budget what are they
 
05:59:52.310 --> 05:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
planning on doing with all this money
 
05:59:55.190 --> 05:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
that they take in in revenues
 
05:59:56.868 --> 05:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it's an unreasonable
 
05:59:56.878 --> 05:59:58.470 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it's an unreasonable
request

05:59:58.470 --> 05:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
request
 
06:00:00.390 --> 06:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
so i thank you and i'll answer any
 
06:00:01.270 --> 06:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
06:00:04.230 --> 06:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
representative you had a question uh two
 
06:00:06.390 --> 06:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
actually uh thank you i will ask for
 
06:00:08.230 --> 06:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
permission before the second one though
 
06:00:10.150 --> 06:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
um my first question to you is you
 
06:00:11.430 --> 06:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
referenced some
 
06:00:15.430 --> 06:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
um 399 um colon 10 f and i didn't have a
 
06:00:17.030 --> 06:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
chance to kind of look it up but you
 
06:00:18.310 --> 06:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
said that it can only be sold with the
 
06:00:20.230 --> 06:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
majority of those two bodies is it a
 
06:00:22.230 --> 06:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
simple majority or is it a super
 
06:00:25.510 --> 06:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
majority uh i believe it's
 
06:00:27.590 --> 06:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
two out of the three commissioners the
 
06:00:29.110 --> 06:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
county commissioners
 
06:00:31.190 --> 06:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh four out of the five
 
06:00:32.948 --> 06:00:32.958 align:start position:0%
gun stock commissioners
 
06:00:35.430 --> 06:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
and two-thirds of the county delegation
 
06:00:36.948 --> 06:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
okay so it looks like a super majority
 
06:00:39.270 --> 06:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you yes and may i ask a second
 
06:00:40.150 --> 06:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:00:40.160 --> 06:00:41.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

06:00:41.030 --> 06:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:42.948 --> 06:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
they've they've been talking about um
 
06:00:44.868 --> 06:00:44.878 align:start position:0%
the default that gunstock did for
 
06:00:46.230 --> 06:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
whatever the reasons why i'm not going
 
06:00:48.230 --> 06:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
to judge anybody but that that was 20
 
06:00:52.070 --> 06:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
years ago why are we waiting to now to
 
06:00:52.080 --> 06:00:53.030 align:start position:0%
years ago why are we waiting to now to
um

06:00:53.030 --> 06:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:55.110 --> 06:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
to suddenly decide that we need to kind
 
06:00:56.788 --> 06:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
of take control and make sure i mean
 
06:00:58.628 --> 06:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
haven't they over the 20 years kind of
 
06:00:59.990 --> 06:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
shown that they are doing the right
 
06:01:03.190 --> 06:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
thing well it was 20 years ago
 
06:01:04.788 --> 06:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
under the recommendation of the study
 
06:01:04.798 --> 06:01:06.070 align:start position:0%
under the recommendation of the study
committees

06:01:06.070 --> 06:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
committees
 
06:01:06.080 --> 06:01:07.030 align:start position:0%
committees
that

06:01:07.030 --> 06:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:01:09.350 --> 06:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
the county
 
06:01:12.310 --> 06:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
bail gun stock out by assuming
 
06:01:13.830 --> 06:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
about six and a half million dollars
 
06:01:15.750 --> 06:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
worth of their debt
 
06:01:17.990 --> 06:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh the committee also recommended that
 
06:01:20.948 --> 06:01:20.958 align:start position:0%
gun stock repay those loans over time
 
06:01:22.788 --> 06:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
when they could
 
06:01:25.670 --> 06:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
and also in that original moa was the
 
06:01:27.590 --> 06:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
requirement that gun stock came before
 
06:01:27.600 --> 06:01:28.470 align:start position:0%
requirement that gun stock came before
the

06:01:28.470 --> 06:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:01:28.480 --> 06:01:29.830 align:start position:0%
the
delegation

06:01:29.830 --> 06:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
06:01:31.910 --> 06:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
to show
 
06:01:33.590 --> 06:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
what they were doing you know present a
 
06:01:33.600 --> 06:01:34.868 align:start position:0%
what they were doing you know present a
budget

06:01:34.868 --> 06:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
budget
 
06:01:37.910 --> 06:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
and they've done that up until the last
 
06:01:40.390 --> 06:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago 2017
 
06:01:42.628 --> 06:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
i think they still presented it even
 
06:01:44.868 --> 06:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
though we didn't have the moa in place
 
06:01:47.030 --> 06:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
but the last couple of years we've just
 
06:01:48.470 --> 06:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
seen no budget
 
06:01:51.110 --> 06:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
and uh one of the things i was
 
06:01:53.590 --> 06:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
um sort of accused of is
 
06:01:54.470 --> 06:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
when the
 
06:01:56.548 --> 06:01:56.558 align:start position:0%
bonuses were brought up in a
 
06:01:56.558 --> 06:01:59.110 align:start position:0%
bonuses were brought up in a
conversation

06:01:59.110 --> 06:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
06:01:59.120 --> 06:02:00.390 align:start position:0%
conversation
we

06:02:00.390 --> 06:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:02:01.830 --> 06:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:02:03.190 --> 06:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
we've always
 
06:02:05.750 --> 06:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
let the commissioners reward the
 
06:02:08.470 --> 06:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
employees with some kind of compensation
 
06:02:10.150 --> 06:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
they've always had some kind of revenue
 
06:02:12.150 --> 06:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
sharing in place
 
06:02:15.910 --> 06:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh not being told what these bonuses
 
06:02:18.470 --> 06:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
were going to be
 
06:02:18.480 --> 06:02:19.270 align:start position:0%
were going to be
uh

06:02:19.270 --> 06:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:02:21.670 --> 06:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
so you know we didn't realize that they
 
06:02:23.270 --> 06:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
were planning on spending you know a
 
06:02:25.030 --> 06:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty thousand dollars to
 
06:02:25.040 --> 06:02:25.990 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty thousand dollars to
bonus

06:02:25.990 --> 06:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
bonus
 
06:02:29.110 --> 06:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know half a dozen employees
 
06:02:30.948 --> 06:02:30.958 align:start position:0%
so that was kind of a
 
06:02:33.190 --> 06:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
you know how do you address
 
06:02:35.510 --> 06:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
something that's normally done but not
 
06:02:37.670 --> 06:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
to that extent
 
06:02:39.750 --> 06:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
without knowing
 
06:02:41.030 --> 06:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
06:02:42.708 --> 06:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
06:02:42.718 --> 06:02:43.830 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
majpudi

06:02:43.830 --> 06:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
majpudi
 
06:02:46.070 --> 06:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr uh thank
 
06:02:47.750 --> 06:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
06:02:47.760 --> 06:02:48.708 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
question

06:02:48.708 --> 06:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:02:50.708 --> 06:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
if um
 
06:02:53.910 --> 06:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
until 2017
 
06:02:58.230 --> 06:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
until 2017. things were fine and
 
06:03:01.430 --> 06:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
have the gun stock area
 
06:03:04.230 --> 06:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
repaid the bond and
 
06:03:06.310 --> 06:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
have they paid the taxes to the
 
06:03:08.628 --> 06:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that they
 
06:03:13.030 --> 06:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
have contributed until 2017
 
06:03:15.670 --> 06:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
yes yearly payments have been made for
 
06:03:15.680 --> 06:03:16.470 align:start position:0%
yes yearly payments have been made for
the

06:03:16.470 --> 06:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:03:20.230 --> 06:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
the moa was renewed every five years and
 
06:03:20.240 --> 06:03:21.350 align:start position:0%
the moa was renewed every five years and
every

06:03:21.350 --> 06:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
every
 
06:03:24.230 --> 06:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
time it was renegotiated the payment
 
06:03:26.548 --> 06:03:26.558 align:start position:0%
schedule changed a little bit but and
 
06:03:30.788 --> 06:03:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:32.788 --> 06:03:32.798 align:start position:0%
about three and a half million dollars
 
06:03:35.670 --> 06:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
of the original six and a half was
 
06:03:35.680 --> 06:03:37.670 align:start position:0%
of the original six and a half was
repaid

06:03:37.670 --> 06:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
repaid
 
06:03:41.510 --> 06:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
and so the legislation that was put in
 
06:03:43.350 --> 06:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
in 2020
 
06:03:46.390 --> 06:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
um house bill 1442
 
06:03:50.788 --> 06:03:50.798 align:start position:0%
was to eliminate the
 
06:03:53.110 --> 06:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
the process of doing an moa every five
 
06:03:53.120 --> 06:03:54.470 align:start position:0%
the process of doing an moa every five
years

06:03:54.470 --> 06:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:03:56.070 --> 06:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
and because every five years you can
 
06:03:57.990 --> 06:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
have a totally different delegation make
 
06:03:58.000 --> 06:03:58.788 align:start position:0%
have a totally different delegation make
up

06:03:58.788 --> 06:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
up
 
06:04:00.548 --> 06:04:00.558 align:start position:0%
totally different
 
06:04:02.868 --> 06:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
uh commission makeup this was to put
 
06:04:05.270 --> 06:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
something in legislation that would
 
06:04:08.708 --> 06:04:08.718 align:start position:0%
over time eventually pay off those
 
06:04:11.030 --> 06:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh bonds that were absorbed by the
 
06:04:13.670 --> 06:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
county taxpayers and then at some point
 
06:04:16.150 --> 06:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
in time when those are paid often it
 
06:04:19.910 --> 06:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
will actually be revenue to the county
 
06:04:22.230 --> 06:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh but right now we're still we're still
 
06:04:24.230 --> 06:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
looking at probably two and a half
 
06:04:26.628 --> 06:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
to three million dollars in bond debt
 
06:04:28.628 --> 06:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
that's never been repaid
 
06:04:32.948 --> 06:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up okay yeah um
 
06:04:36.230 --> 06:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
just the last two years you referred to
 
06:04:38.230 --> 06:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
i know there were no payments made no
 
06:04:40.628 --> 06:04:40.638 align:start position:0%
last two years when we look back would
 
06:04:43.110 --> 06:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
you believe that we were in a pandemic
 
06:04:46.310 --> 06:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
year nobody knew what was going on or
 
06:04:48.470 --> 06:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
is that something that
 
06:04:51.430 --> 06:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
we are in as legislators we had no idea
 
06:04:53.670 --> 06:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
what was how we were dealing with that
 
06:04:58.230 --> 06:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
so is that a consideration at all or
 
06:05:01.110 --> 06:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
having done something really good in the
 
06:05:03.110 --> 06:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
middle of a pandemic wasn't that
 
06:05:05.110 --> 06:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
something that we have to reward our
 
06:05:07.270 --> 06:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
businesses yes and i think all the
 
06:05:08.708 --> 06:05:08.718 align:start position:0%
employees of gun stock should be
 
06:05:08.718 --> 06:05:10.310 align:start position:0%
employees of gun stock should be
rewarded

06:05:10.310 --> 06:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
rewarded
 
06:05:10.320 --> 06:05:11.110 align:start position:0%
rewarded
my

06:05:11.110 --> 06:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:05:13.350 --> 06:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
my question
 
06:05:15.190 --> 06:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
rebuttal question that would be well we
 
06:05:17.030 --> 06:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
still put together a state budget even
 
06:05:18.708 --> 06:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
though we're in a
 
06:05:21.110 --> 06:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know uh interesting situation with
 
06:05:21.120 --> 06:05:22.230 align:start position:0%
you know uh interesting situation with
cohort

06:05:22.230 --> 06:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
cohort
 
06:05:26.310 --> 06:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh and we've heard testimony today that
 
06:05:28.628 --> 06:05:28.638 align:start position:0%
refers to their budget
 
06:05:30.070 --> 06:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
themselves they've talked about their
 
06:05:32.070 --> 06:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
budget and staying in budget or
 
06:05:34.628 --> 06:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
exceeding budget you know all the
 
06:05:37.350 --> 06:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
delegation is asking for here is to be
 
06:05:39.670 --> 06:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
able to look at your budget let's
 
06:05:41.510 --> 06:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
show us your budget so we know what
 
06:05:42.948 --> 06:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
you're doing
 
06:05:44.390 --> 06:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know that's transparency in
 
06:05:46.390 --> 06:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
government and this is a government
 
06:05:47.910 --> 06:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
entity i know it's running like a
 
06:05:50.310 --> 06:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
business but it's still
 
06:05:52.150 --> 06:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
owned by the taxpayers and it's a
 
06:05:57.030 --> 06:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:57.040 --> 06:05:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:05:58.390 --> 06:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:05:58.400 --> 06:05:59.430 align:start position:0%

wrong
 
06:06:00.868 --> 06:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
06:06:03.190 --> 06:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
06:06:05.670 --> 06:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
so with your testimony
 
06:06:07.430 --> 06:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
gun stock's been
 
06:06:09.510 --> 06:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
owned by the county for over 80 years
 
06:06:12.628 --> 06:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
and operated as a ski resort
 
06:06:14.948 --> 06:06:14.958 align:start position:0%
yes originally it was basically just a
 
06:06:14.958 --> 06:06:16.310 align:start position:0%
yes originally it was basically just a
skier

06:06:16.310 --> 06:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
skier
 
06:06:18.628 --> 06:06:18.638 align:start position:0%
how would you consider is it responsibly
 
06:06:21.270 --> 06:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
managed compared to comparable ski areas
 
06:06:23.190 --> 06:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
06:06:25.750 --> 06:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh right now it's being well managed yes
 
06:06:27.430 --> 06:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know i have no we have no problem
 
06:06:30.230 --> 06:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
with the management all we want is to
 
06:06:32.310 --> 06:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
see a budget
 
06:06:34.230 --> 06:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
you know just like any other department
 
06:06:36.150 --> 06:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
you know we could we could tell the show
 
06:06:37.830 --> 06:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
if yeah go ahead you know do whatever
 
06:06:39.510 --> 06:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
you want we don't care to see your
 
06:06:41.750 --> 06:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
budget that wouldn't be responsible to
 
06:06:43.350 --> 06:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers
 
06:06:45.670 --> 06:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman thank you
 
06:06:45.680 --> 06:06:46.470 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman thank you
so

06:06:46.470 --> 06:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:06:48.708 --> 06:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
after hearing the testimony today do you
 
06:06:50.868 --> 06:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
do you think it should operate as the
 
06:06:52.868 --> 06:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department or should it have
 
06:06:55.030 --> 06:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
special considerations because of the
 
06:06:57.830 --> 06:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
business nature and the industry
 
06:07:00.070 --> 06:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
um operations that we see in that type
 
06:07:02.788 --> 06:07:02.798 align:start position:0%
of industry yes
 
06:07:06.628 --> 06:07:06.638 align:start position:0%
the enabling statute 399 is the document
 
06:07:09.350 --> 06:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
that gives them their special
 
06:07:09.360 --> 06:07:10.390 align:start position:0%
that gives them their special
powers

06:07:10.390 --> 06:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
powers
 
06:07:11.910 --> 06:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's
 
06:07:14.948 --> 06:07:14.958 align:start position:0%
you know it's all listed in here
 
06:07:17.270 --> 06:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
um under the statute
 
06:07:21.030 --> 06:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
and it works well occasionally you know
 
06:07:22.868 --> 06:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
it needs to be looked at and maybe
 
06:07:24.868 --> 06:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
something needs to be tweaked and i
 
06:07:26.948 --> 06:07:26.958 align:start position:0%
think right now this is something that
 
06:07:29.670 --> 06:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
two study committees found in the 90s
 
06:07:32.390 --> 06:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
when gun stock was actually getting
 
06:07:34.708 --> 06:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
further behind in their debt plus they
 
06:07:36.150 --> 06:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
were coming to the
 
06:07:40.390 --> 06:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:41.990 --> 06:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
from the taxpayers to keep it
 
06:07:42.000 --> 06:07:43.270 align:start position:0%
from the taxpayers to keep it
functioning

06:07:43.270 --> 06:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
functioning
 
06:07:45.750 --> 06:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
and at that time both study committees
 
06:07:47.430 --> 06:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
recommended that
 
06:07:50.868 --> 06:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
gunstock produce an annual budget
 
06:07:53.910 --> 06:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
to the delegation
 
06:07:56.150 --> 06:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
and they've done that since up until the
 
06:07:57.590 --> 06:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
last couple of years
 
06:07:59.510 --> 06:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
follow up just one more thank you mr
 
06:07:59.520 --> 06:08:00.390 align:start position:0%
follow up just one more thank you mr
chairman

06:08:00.390 --> 06:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:08:02.310 --> 06:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
06:08:04.628 --> 06:08:04.638 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony today that there is a
 
06:08:06.788 --> 06:08:06.798 align:start position:0%
communication i mean the commissioners
 
06:08:06.798 --> 06:08:07.670 align:start position:0%
communication i mean the commissioners
are

06:08:07.670 --> 06:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:08:09.990 --> 06:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
appointed by the delegation correct
 
06:08:13.590 --> 06:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
correct and they do present a budget
 
06:08:15.190 --> 06:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
and they share their financial
 
06:08:17.350 --> 06:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
information with the delegation is that
 
06:08:17.360 --> 06:08:18.150 align:start position:0%
information with the delegation is that
true

06:08:18.150 --> 06:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
true
 
06:08:19.910 --> 06:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
no they what they
 
06:08:22.548 --> 06:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
what they give us annually is a audit of
 
06:08:27.590 --> 06:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:27.600 --> 06:08:28.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:08:28.390 --> 06:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:08:31.110 --> 06:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
okay we want we want to see a projected
 
06:08:32.390 --> 06:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
budget for
 
06:08:34.390 --> 06:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
the current year
 
06:08:36.070 --> 06:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
okay and like i said they've done that
 
06:08:38.150 --> 06:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
in the past for the last you know since
 
06:08:42.628 --> 06:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
the moa's enactment in 2001.
 
06:08:43.910 --> 06:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:08:46.310 --> 06:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
but they you know that practice stopped
 
06:08:47.910 --> 06:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
when uh
 
06:08:49.830 --> 06:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago when the moa
 
06:08:54.390 --> 06:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:57.750 --> 06:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
one more i promise it'll be the last one
 
06:09:01.110 --> 06:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'm reading the bill right now and
 
06:09:03.430 --> 06:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
i think just presenting a budget as what
 
06:09:06.310 --> 06:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
you're you're hoping occurs
 
06:09:09.830 --> 06:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
is is not just what this bill is about
 
06:09:12.070 --> 06:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
um and i just want to point out section
 
06:09:13.510 --> 06:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
h and i
 
06:09:15.430 --> 06:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:09:15.440 --> 06:09:16.708 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

06:09:16.708 --> 06:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:19.430 --> 06:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so you know the the proposed
 
06:09:21.830 --> 06:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
legislative change right now is
 
06:09:24.708 --> 06:09:24.718 align:start position:0%
uh probably a little more extreme
 
06:09:24.718 --> 06:09:25.830 align:start position:0%
uh probably a little more extreme
than

06:09:25.830 --> 06:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
than
 
06:09:25.840 --> 06:09:26.708 align:start position:0%
than
some

06:09:26.708 --> 06:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
some
 
06:09:28.390 --> 06:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
members of the delegation feel is
 
06:09:28.400 --> 06:09:29.990 align:start position:0%
members of the delegation feel is
necessary

06:09:29.990 --> 06:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
06:09:32.150 --> 06:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
but i'm supporting it
 
06:09:34.070 --> 06:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
because i know
 
06:09:36.070 --> 06:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
how the legislative process works and
 
06:09:38.470 --> 06:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
how we can amend it to make it work for
 
06:09:40.548 --> 06:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
all parties involved
 
06:09:44.868 --> 06:09:44.878 align:start position:0%
thank you i uh before we go to our last
 
06:09:44.878 --> 06:09:47.030 align:start position:0%
thank you i uh before we go to our last
representative

thank you for indulging me on chairman
 
06:09:51.030 --> 06:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
and um i just again have two quick
 
06:09:54.390 --> 06:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
questions i'm sorry i keep playing um
 
06:09:56.230 --> 06:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
trying to look at you through another
 
06:09:58.150 --> 06:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
06:09:58.160 --> 06:09:59.590 align:start position:0%
representative um
the

06:09:59.590 --> 06:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:10:02.230 --> 06:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
i when i'm looking at the um
 
06:10:04.230 --> 06:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
the statements of net position i look at
 
06:10:08.788 --> 06:10:08.798 align:start position:0%
2021 i see the 247 404 paid i assume
 
06:10:10.548 --> 06:10:10.558 align:start position:0%
that was to the um
 
06:10:12.788 --> 06:10:12.798 align:start position:0%
to the county and then i see in 2020
 
06:10:15.350 --> 06:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
that there was nothing nothing paid in
 
06:10:18.868 --> 06:10:18.878 align:start position:0%
the previous years 2019 2018 2017 where
 
06:10:20.548 --> 06:10:20.558 align:start position:0%
we don't have those numbers was there
 
06:10:22.948 --> 06:10:22.958 align:start position:0%
anything paid no there wasn't so just
 
06:10:25.510 --> 06:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
2021 you're saying is that correct yes
 
06:10:28.628 --> 06:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
yes and 17 was the last year
 
06:10:30.868 --> 06:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
a payment was made under the
 
06:10:33.270 --> 06:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
we did a like a continuing resolution on
 
06:10:35.270 --> 06:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
the moa for one year
 
06:10:37.190 --> 06:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
to try to hammer out the differences
 
06:10:38.628 --> 06:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
between the delegation and the
 
06:10:38.638 --> 06:10:40.470 align:start position:0%
between the delegation and the
commission

06:10:40.470 --> 06:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
commission
 
06:10:41.590 --> 06:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:10:44.150 --> 06:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
you know we finally come up with the a
 
06:10:47.350 --> 06:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
compromise and a way forward on the
 
06:10:51.030 --> 06:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:52.708 --> 06:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
may i just clarify that one question i
 
06:10:52.718 --> 06:10:53.590 align:start position:0%
may i just clarify that one question i
just

06:10:53.590 --> 06:10:53.600 align:start position:0%

so i i do see though in 2020 there was a
 
06:10:58.390 --> 06:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
payment of 247

county

06:12:23.750 --> 06:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
county
 
06:12:23.760 --> 06:12:24.708 align:start position:0%
county
um

06:12:24.708 --> 06:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:26.150 --> 06:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know this is the first time i think
 
06:12:28.788 --> 06:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
i'm ever heard of legislation because a
 
06:12:30.628 --> 06:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
chartering organization is doing too
 
06:12:33.110 --> 06:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
good we want to penalize them and take
 
06:12:34.708 --> 06:12:34.718 align:start position:0%
away their budgeting powers because we
 
06:12:36.470 --> 06:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
don't want that so great
 
06:12:37.830 --> 06:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
i think representative manjapudi had a
 
06:12:39.750 --> 06:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
nail on the head earlier when she was
 
06:12:42.310 --> 06:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
talking about the exercise of oversight
 
06:12:45.030 --> 06:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
is done through the process of
 
06:12:47.110 --> 06:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
appointment and the in the process of
 
06:12:49.670 --> 06:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
removal which the belt up delegation has
 
06:12:51.110 --> 06:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
full authority
 
06:12:52.708 --> 06:12:52.718 align:start position:0%
if you're wondering why we're here one
 
06:12:54.310 --> 06:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
of the things you'll also know is that
 
06:12:56.470 --> 06:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
belknap county is in the middle of i
 
06:12:57.430 --> 06:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
don't know i think at this point we've
 
06:12:59.110 --> 06:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
had four commissioners that we've had
 
06:13:00.948 --> 06:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
allegations against that that people
 
06:13:02.548 --> 06:13:02.558 align:start position:0%
wanted to remove and not remove and the
 
06:13:04.628 --> 06:13:04.638 align:start position:0%
delegation can't make up its mind
 
06:13:06.628 --> 06:13:06.638 align:start position:0%
and on top of that we also have the
 
06:13:08.708 --> 06:13:08.718 align:start position:0%
commissioners the county commissioners
 
06:13:09.990 --> 06:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
and the belknap county delegation
 
06:13:11.750 --> 06:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
fighting in a lawsuit as well so kind of
 
06:13:13.270 --> 06:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
give you the nature of the belknap
 
06:13:15.030 --> 06:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
county delegation and its relationship
 
06:13:18.310 --> 06:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
with other entities within our county
 
06:13:20.628 --> 06:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about belham county and
 
06:13:22.390 --> 06:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
it was a lot talked about covid and what
 
06:13:23.910 --> 06:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
happened in the last two years i served
 
06:13:25.750 --> 06:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
on the governor's reopening task force
 
06:13:27.750 --> 06:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
um i did that uh for
 
06:13:30.310 --> 06:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
a year and a half 72 meetings i don't
 
06:13:33.190 --> 06:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
know how many uh guidances i drafted and
 
06:13:35.350 --> 06:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
amended through that process as one of
 
06:13:36.708 --> 06:13:36.718 align:start position:0%
the chief members on the on the
 
06:13:38.548 --> 06:13:38.558 align:start position:0%
reopening task force including the ski
 
06:13:41.190 --> 06:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
rules um the hospitality rules food and
 
06:13:43.270 --> 06:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
beverage we all know about how bad our
 
06:13:45.110 --> 06:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
businesses were hit hard in the food and
 
06:13:47.350 --> 06:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
beverage areas but and that that was a
 
06:13:49.910 --> 06:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
direct relationship to gun stock in
 
06:13:51.350 --> 06:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
addition to that we had the outdoor
 
06:13:53.510 --> 06:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
attractions guidance which again limited
 
06:13:55.670 --> 06:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
and restricted what was going on in that
 
06:13:57.670 --> 06:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
in in gun stock so if you don't know gun
 
06:14:00.390 --> 06:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
stocks not just skiing uh at gun stock
 
06:14:04.628 --> 06:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
i've skeed i've segwayed i've ziplined
 
06:14:07.830 --> 06:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
i've swam camped hiked
 
06:14:09.510 --> 06:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot four seasons since i've
 
06:14:11.670 --> 06:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
been around in belknap county in four
 
06:14:13.750 --> 06:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
decades i've raised four kids all of
 
06:14:15.910 --> 06:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
which have learned to ski and on other
 
06:14:17.350 --> 06:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
things it was our family activity we
 
06:14:19.110 --> 06:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
went camping there we went ziplining
 
06:14:19.120 --> 06:14:20.788 align:start position:0%
went camping there we went ziplining
there

06:14:20.788 --> 06:14:20.798 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:14:22.948 --> 06:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
so again a lot they've done a lot to
 
06:14:25.350 --> 06:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
turn this into a four-season destination
 
06:14:27.350 --> 06:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
and the management's been great
 
06:14:29.110 --> 06:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
06:14:30.868 --> 06:14:30.878 align:start position:0%
how were there rough times back 20 years
 
06:14:33.030 --> 06:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
ago sure but i'm pretty sure that was an
 
06:14:34.868 --> 06:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
economic hardship for everybody and not
 
06:14:37.190 --> 06:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
just gun stock by itself and because of
 
06:14:39.670 --> 06:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
its decisions we all know that uh going
 
06:14:39.680 --> 06:14:40.628 align:start position:0%
its decisions we all know that uh going
back

06:14:40.628 --> 06:14:40.638 align:start position:0%
back
 
06:14:42.868 --> 06:14:42.878 align:start position:0%
around 2000 there were some issues
 
06:14:45.670 --> 06:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
um the member the dot com bubble burst
 
06:14:47.510 --> 06:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
right and everybody was in financial
 
06:14:48.868 --> 06:14:48.878 align:start position:0%
trouble for a long time a lot of
 
06:14:50.708 --> 06:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
businesses failed
 
06:14:50.718 --> 06:14:51.990 align:start position:0%
businesses failed
so

06:14:51.990 --> 06:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:14:53.990 --> 06:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'm going to say the one
 
06:14:55.990 --> 06:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
word you heard representative silver say
 
06:14:58.830 --> 06:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again
 
06:15:01.350 --> 06:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
control that's what this is about
 
06:15:03.110 --> 06:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
maintaining control
 
06:15:04.788 --> 06:15:04.798 align:start position:0%
they want to know what's going they want
 
06:15:06.868 --> 06:15:06.878 align:start position:0%
to know i will tell you that in my
 
06:15:09.030 --> 06:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
relationship my three terms with gun
 
06:15:09.040 --> 06:15:10.708 align:start position:0%
relationship my three terms with gun
stock

06:15:10.708 --> 06:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
stock
 
06:15:12.310 --> 06:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
anytime i picked up the phone and called
 
06:15:13.750 --> 06:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
and asked for information it was given
 
06:15:15.430 --> 06:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
to me within one or two days didn't
 
06:15:17.190 --> 06:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
matter what it was
 
06:15:18.708 --> 06:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
somebody was on the phone with me and
 
06:15:20.708 --> 06:15:20.718 align:start position:0%
and presenting it to me or emailing to
 
06:15:22.150 --> 06:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
me and getting it the information's
 
06:15:24.310 --> 06:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
there the financials are online you can
 
06:15:25.910 --> 06:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
go to the gun stock area commissioner's
 
06:15:27.350 --> 06:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
website and all the budgeting all the
 
06:15:28.470 --> 06:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
minute meetings are there all the
 
06:15:29.750 --> 06:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
budgeting stuff is there so it's
 
06:15:31.590 --> 06:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
available for anybody
 
06:15:32.948 --> 06:15:32.958 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:15:35.110 --> 06:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
as you can tell i don't like this bill
 
06:15:36.948 --> 06:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see it killed
 
06:15:39.030 --> 06:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
i think that you're stepping into a
 
06:15:41.190 --> 06:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
squabble family squabble that's going on
 
06:15:42.628 --> 06:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
right now that needs to be resolved
 
06:15:44.230 --> 06:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
within the family
 
06:15:45.750 --> 06:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
and not through legislation this is
 
06:15:47.830 --> 06:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
using the sledgehammer to fix the
 
06:15:51.350 --> 06:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
problem and i'd urge you to vote itl
 
06:15:53.190 --> 06:15:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:15:56.070 --> 06:15:56.080 align:start position:0%

understand
 
06:16:02.628 --> 06:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
today was the public hearing
 
06:16:04.628 --> 06:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
and we have to now take it through an
 
06:16:06.150 --> 06:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
06:16:09.590 --> 06:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
the executive session is is when we will
 
06:16:12.150 --> 06:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
individually vote on whether we support
 
06:16:15.270 --> 06:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
or reject the bill that's before us
 
06:16:15.280 --> 06:16:16.628 align:start position:0%
or reject the bill that's before us
uh

06:16:16.628 --> 06:16:16.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:16:20.230 --> 06:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
cal i i urge you to review the house
 
06:16:20.240 --> 06:16:21.510 align:start position:0%
cal i i urge you to review the house
calendar

06:16:21.510 --> 06:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
06:16:23.590 --> 06:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
because it's not published yet when that
 
06:16:25.830 --> 06:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
executive session is going to be held
 
06:16:26.948 --> 06:16:26.958 align:start position:0%
but i would
 
06:16:29.030 --> 06:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
i would believe we're talking about
 
06:16:30.708 --> 06:16:30.718 align:start position:0%
somewhere around
 
06:16:35.030 --> 06:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
the end of the week of february 7th
 
06:16:36.708 --> 06:16:36.718 align:start position:0%
so if you're if you're curious and want
 
06:16:38.788 --> 06:16:38.798 align:start position:0%
to be here you can't input to the
 
06:16:40.548 --> 06:16:40.558 align:start position:0%
executive session but you can certainly
 
06:16:40.558 --> 06:16:41.750 align:start position:0%
executive session but you can certainly
observe

06:16:41.750 --> 06:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
observe
 
06:16:44.230 --> 06:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
and make notes but somewhere around the
 
06:16:46.390 --> 06:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
week of february 7th is when we will
 
06:16:48.310 --> 06:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
execute this bill but
 
06:16:50.708 --> 06:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
the exact date will be published in the
 
06:16:52.390 --> 06:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
house calendar
 
06:16:54.150 --> 06:16:54.160 align:start position:0%

06:16:57.510 --> 06:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
later this week for that that time frame
 
06:17:00.390 --> 06:17:00.400 align:start position:0%

06:19:27.990 --> 06:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
what i you know we see in a large number
 
06:19:31.510 --> 06:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
of opposition on online so what you're
 
06:19:33.990 --> 06:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
hearing from your constituency is
 
06:19:36.390 --> 06:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
exactly opposite of what this bill wants
 
06:19:38.708 --> 06:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
to do am i correct absolutely vast
 
06:19:39.910 --> 06:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
majority of the citizens that have
 
06:19:41.830 --> 06:19:41.840 align:start position:0%

06:19:43.830 --> 06:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
you look online i checked before i came
 
06:19:46.948 --> 06:19:46.958 align:start position:0%
down committee on the online vote online
 
06:19:49.110 --> 06:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
you know opposition support it's five to
 
06:19:50.548 --> 06:19:50.558 align:start position:0%
two hundred and thirty something never
 
06:19:52.548 --> 06:19:52.558 align:start position:0%

some written clarification i think that
 
06:20:24.390 --> 06:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
would be more appropriate otherwise
 
06:20:26.150 --> 06:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to give
 
06:20:28.708 --> 06:20:28.718 align:start position:0%
that same opportunity to do others on
 
06:20:28.718 --> 06:20:29.510 align:start position:0%

if you can just highlight what the
 
06:31:13.350 --> 06:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
amendment does to
 
06:31:28.948 --> 06:31:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:30.628 --> 06:31:30.638 align:start position:0%
we had a bunch of questions at the
 
06:31:33.830 --> 06:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
hearing and what she has done
 
06:31:33.840 --> 06:31:35.110 align:start position:0%
hearing and what she has done
is

06:31:35.110 --> 06:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:31:35.120 --> 06:31:37.350 align:start position:0%
is
answer

06:31:37.350 --> 06:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
answer
 
06:31:39.990 --> 06:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
the questions that we had when we heard
 
06:31:41.030 --> 06:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
06:31:42.708 --> 06:31:42.718 align:start position:0%
and made changes
 
06:31:46.070 --> 06:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
some of them had to do with
 
06:31:48.948 --> 06:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
what you could use the money for
 
06:31:53.030 --> 06:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
and oh we reduced in line 26 a
 
06:31:54.948 --> 06:31:54.958 align:start position:0%
municipality may only draw from the
 
06:31:57.430 --> 06:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
municipal road and brief bridge disaster
 
06:31:59.270 --> 06:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
relief fund if the amount of the total
 
06:32:01.910 --> 06:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
damage is at least 50 and it was a
 
06:32:03.750 --> 06:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
hundred percent originally which we
 
06:32:05.670 --> 06:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
thought was too high
 
06:32:08.660 --> 06:32:08.670 align:start position:0%
um i think the administration
 
06:32:08.670 --> 06:32:10.468 align:start position:0%
um i think the administration
[Music]

06:32:10.468 --> 06:32:10.478 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:32:14.150 --> 06:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
has been altered
 
06:32:16.548 --> 06:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
but primarily it was that question about
 
06:32:20.070 --> 06:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
how much of the damage should it be
 
06:32:22.070 --> 06:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
um is one of the
 
06:32:24.070 --> 06:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
oh and the municipalities wishing to
 
06:32:25.590 --> 06:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
draw from this fund in the future this
 
06:32:27.350 --> 06:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
was a drafting error
 
06:32:29.270 --> 06:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities wishing to draw from this
 
06:32:31.030 --> 06:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
fund in the future shall pay into the
 
06:32:33.590 --> 06:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
fund annually in an amount equal to one
 
06:32:36.390 --> 06:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
half of one percent of its municipal
 
06:32:38.628 --> 06:32:38.638 align:start position:0%
operating budget and that was a drafting
 
06:32:41.110 --> 06:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
error earlier i think it was like one
 
06:32:43.910 --> 06:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
hundredth of one percent before clearly
 
06:32:43.920 --> 06:32:45.190 align:start position:0%
hundredth of one percent before clearly
wrong

06:32:45.190 --> 06:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
06:32:47.430 --> 06:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
um that's the parts that i remember
 
06:32:49.430 --> 06:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
having been corrected
 
06:32:51.910 --> 06:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
right this is uh an amendment put forth
 
06:32:54.230 --> 06:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
by representative aaron and
 
06:32:57.350 --> 06:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
she has seen this and concurs with it
 
06:33:00.310 --> 06:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:00.320 --> 06:33:01.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:33:01.430 --> 06:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:33:03.510 --> 06:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
you might have said this iv2 but i think
 
06:33:06.788 --> 06:33:06.798 align:start position:0%
one of the other important things is uh
 
06:33:08.868 --> 06:33:08.878 align:start position:0%
line one on page two an assessment
 
06:33:10.868 --> 06:33:10.878 align:start position:0%
report be prepared by professional

exactly what it's
 
06:33:20.468 --> 06:33:20.478 align:start position:0%
a certified road engineer and this just
 
06:33:22.948 --> 06:33:22.958 align:start position:0%
makes it which is a thing that i think
 
06:33:25.430 --> 06:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
mostly doesn't exist yeah so we were we
 
06:33:29.030 --> 06:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
were giving a title as something that uh
 
06:33:31.110 --> 06:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't exist yet
 
06:33:32.628 --> 06:33:32.638 align:start position:0%

06:33:39.830 --> 06:33:39.840 align:start position:0%

now i
 
06:37:14.948 --> 06:37:14.958 align:start position:0%
i will um
 
06:37:16.548 --> 06:37:16.558 align:start position:0%
attempt to put this on the consent
 
06:37:19.590 --> 06:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
calendar but because it has a financial
 
06:37:21.990 --> 06:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh note on it i may not be able to do
 
06:37:25.430 --> 06:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
that so uh
 
06:37:27.750 --> 06:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
we'll see what happens i i there's some
 
06:37:29.990 --> 06:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
a little confusion about that
 
06:37:31.910 --> 06:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
06:37:33.670 --> 06:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
i think it's unlikely that we get it on
 
06:37:36.070 --> 06:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar but it'll appear in
 
06:37:36.080 --> 06:37:37.030 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar but it'll appear in
the

06:37:37.030 --> 06:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:37:40.868 --> 06:37:40.878 align:start position:0%
in the regular calendar if not on a
 
06:37:44.788 --> 06:37:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:47.030 --> 06:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay that ends the
 
06:37:52.150 --> 06:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:56.628 --> 06:37:56.638 align:start position:0%

friday
 
06:38:07.510 --> 06:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't intend
 
06:38:09.030 --> 06:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
i told you
 
06:38:10.390 --> 06:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
today i didn't intend to have an
 
06:38:12.230 --> 06:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
executive session but i don't intend to
 
06:38:14.468 --> 06:38:14.478 align:start position:0%
have any executive sessions thursday or
 
06:38:16.150 --> 06:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
friday but we have set we do have
 
06:38:18.230 --> 06:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
hearings thursday and friday
 
06:38:19.750 --> 06:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
so if you
 
06:38:22.070 --> 06:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
i want you to be safe if you
 
06:38:26.150 --> 06:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
look out the window and find a driving
 
06:38:29.190 --> 06:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
snowstorm on friday morning i ask you to
 
06:38:30.788 --> 06:38:30.798 align:start position:0%
use your own judgment whether or not you
 
06:38:31.990 --> 06:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
can safely
 
06:38:34.788 --> 06:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
make it to the state house but
 
06:38:36.948 --> 06:38:36.958 align:start position:0%
the only requirement we'll have is we
 
06:38:38.548 --> 06:38:38.558 align:start position:0%
need to have a quorum
 
06:38:40.948 --> 06:38:40.958 align:start position:0%
in order to conduct business
 
06:38:40.958 --> 06:38:41.670 align:start position:0%
in order to conduct business
but

06:38:41.670 --> 06:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:38:43.830 --> 06:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
you don't have to worry about executive
 
06:38:45.670 --> 06:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
session absenteeism because we're not
 
06:38:52.150 --> 06:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:52.160 --> 06:38:53.430 align:start position:0%

06:38:57.190 --> 06:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:58.468 --> 06:38:58.478 align:start position:0%
