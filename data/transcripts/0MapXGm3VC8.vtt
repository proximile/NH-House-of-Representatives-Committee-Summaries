m

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
m
 
00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
chair uh it's good to be here and glad
 
00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
to see folks who could come in despite
 
00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:40.039 align:start position:0%
the weather for the record uh I am
 
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative Mike Moffett representing
 
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
miramac District 4 the lovely towns of
 
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
Canterbury in
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
Lowden uh the the Genesis for this
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
measure occurred at an ncsl conference
 
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
National um Convention of state
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
legislators uh where I I did attend a
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
panel discussion on this this subject of
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
veterans courts uh along with the chair
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
here The Honorable representative from
 
00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959 align:start position:0%
wendam uh and we learned that several
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
other states have established fictions
 
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
so this of course raises the question as
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
to why
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
veterans um in some cases May rate their
 
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
own Court should a veteran guilty of a
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
felony domestic violence say be treated
 
00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519 align:start position:0%
differently than a civilian who is uh
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
similarly convicted of the same crime
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
so we we do have a history of of
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
multi-tier Justice options so to speak
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
as you all probably know better than me
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
if a veteran was on active duty military
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
person was on active duty he could face
 
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
a military Court marshal for alleged
 
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
misconduct where the consequences could
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
be better or worse uh than what might
 
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
occur in a civilian court but a
 
00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:55.959 align:start position:0%
discharged veteran in legal Peril is at
 
00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
the mercy of of Civilian Justice for
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
better for worse
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
so should his veteran or her should his
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
or her veteran status matter when it
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
comes to adjudication and sentencing and
 
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:12.200 align:start position:0%
many of us say yes uh extend extenuating
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
and mitigating circumstances have long
 
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
come into play when passing sentences on
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
convicted felons so should military
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
service be considered extenuating or
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
mitigating maybe so full disclosure I am
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
a veteran I chair the house veterans
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
committee here as you probably know um
 
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
and I have served obviously with many
 
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
veterans over the many years to include
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
some Vietnam veterans and uh and I'm
 
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:42.200 align:start position:0%
quite aware of how many of them Vietnam
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
veterans in particular and other
 
00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
Veterans as well uh ended up in legal
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
trouble following their service
 
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
especially if they were In Harm's Way uh
 
00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:53.639 align:start position:0%
in combat
 
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
situations in 1998 almost 60,000 Vietnam
 
00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
War veterans
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
were incarcerated
 
00:11:02.079 --> 00:11:03.750 align:start position:0%
were incarcerated
60,000

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
60,000
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
Nationwide so sending 19y olds into
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
Harm's Way To Suffer family separation
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
mortal danger uncertainty uh the
 
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
brutalizing experience of combat is is
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
setting Folks up for for trouble later
 
00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:23.959 align:start position:0%
on so most veterans whether the
 
00:11:23.959 --> 00:11:25.269 align:start position:0%
on so most veterans whether the
experience

00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
okay especially if they have support
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
structures involving friends and and
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
family and Faith but some do not have
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
those support
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
structures and some mostly young men get
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
broken physically Andor emotionally and
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
so they're subsequently at higher risk
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
for destructive Behavior to include
 
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.829 align:start position:0%
for destructive Behavior to include
criminal

00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
Behavior so should a combat veteran who
 
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:53.240 align:start position:0%
beats up his wife be treated differently
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
than a civilian who beats up his wife
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
just to use that come back to that
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
example and that's really the nub of the
 
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
question here so establishing a veterans
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
court by definition would involve
 
00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:05.959 align:start position:0%
different penalty options but to be
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
clear our justice system depends on
 
00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:12.519 align:start position:0%
accountability and consequences for
 
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.160 align:start position:0%
criminal Behavior even if it's not
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
always perfectly me it out someone who
 
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
joins a military and sacrifices their
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
personal sovereignty for their country's
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
greater good does rate in my view uh
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
some unique attention when they are
 
00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
broken during their service to their
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
country and this is not to excuse
 
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
criminal Behavior at all but unique
 
00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
sentencing options through a veterans
 
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
court that limit or reduce incarceration
 
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
has has could have its value so we
 
00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
already have so-called drug
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
courts and the purpose of which is to
 
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
meet out appropriate punishment while
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
also seeking to reduce incarceration and
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
recidivism with all the accompanying
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
expenses that go with those so
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
sentencing options that can involve
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
punishments and sanctions while also
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
providing treatments while reducing jail
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
time just makes sense for everybody so
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
HB 1589 seeks to apply the the drug
 
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
court concept to uh veterans and with a
 
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.069 align:start position:0%
court concept to uh veterans and with a
veterans

00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
court um and many veterans uh as with
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
drug courts many veterans struggle with
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
addiction situations as well as PTSD
 
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
physical wounds and scars emotional
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
scars and uh and all the other baggage
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
associated with family separation
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
extended time in life or death
 
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
situations there so there already are
 
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
some some veteran Court type options in
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but there are
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
gaps and there's a need to better Define
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
Justice options to fill those gaps and
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of
 
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
1589 uh the chair and I did meet with
 
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
some legal experts uh New Hampshire
 
00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:01.959 align:start position:0%
legal experts on this subject who had
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
some ideas about improving some of the
 
00:14:06.189 --> 00:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
language and I expect that this may
 
00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
result in in some amending language I
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
would anticipate and that of course is
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
the business of this committee um I
 
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
forwarded some information the committee
 
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
already including a message from Kathy
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
Kathy Corey Fox uh an attorney um and
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
she represents Harbor care as well as
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Bar Association and I
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
forwarded I emailed the committee
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
members uh some language um
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
recommendations um to change three words
 
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
on page three line6 to better
 
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
Define veteran what what which is
 
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
important what is what is a veteran and
 
00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:45.759 align:start position:0%
finally as a veteran I will say that our
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
country generally does a a very
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
creditable job in taking care of those
 
00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
who who've dawned our country's
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
uniform um and inevitably there are
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
veterans who have never been in harms
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
Harm's Way and this is something that we
 
00:15:02.749 --> 00:15:02.759 align:start position:0%
need to acknowledge that there are those
 
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
veterans who sometimes take advantage of
 
00:15:06.749 --> 00:15:06.759 align:start position:0%
the of the support that's out there for
 
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
veterans some veterans who've Never Been
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
In Harm's Way uh it troubles me when
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
they when they claim uh PTSD for example
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
when they they've never left the
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
country um so that's that's those folks
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
who do embellish their situations and
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
exploit their veteran status when it
 
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
suits them that's something that will
 
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
need to be U dealt with individually
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
down the road there'll always be that
 
00:15:34.749 --> 00:15:34.759 align:start position:0%
small percentage of uh Gamers so to
 
00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:36.759 align:start position:0%
speak so we have to trust it decision
 
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
makers will fairly and fully evaluate
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
veterans uh seek those veterans are
 
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
seeking extend based on their service
 
00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
and the veterans who don't rate
 
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
mitigation uh do not receive it so there
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
you have it and I'd be happy to try to
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if if there are
 
00:15:56.309 --> 00:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
any questions from members of the
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
committee representative tur
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
taking the question um you actually
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
focused on the the section of the bill
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
that I I drew my attention when I read
 
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
it which is uh page three the definition
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
of veterans and I want to ask about part
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
C of that where it says um a current or
 
00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
former contractor of the United States
 
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense um that was the
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
part of it that I I struggled because it
 
00:16:26.749 --> 00:16:26.759 align:start position:0%
seems like it has the potential to
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
greatly expand the pool of of people
 
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
that would uh fall into this while
 
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
stretching sort of the the concept that
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
I think you were just talking about so
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
could you talk to that a little bit sure
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
that's a great question that's why the
 
00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:41.959 align:start position:0%
the definition of veteran and and who
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
would qualify really matters it's a
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
great question and and contractors uh
 
00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily your traditional type
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
of uh service person um but with a
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
contractor who has been hired by the
 
00:16:59.470 --> 00:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
government to work to help uh military
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
operations uh and and suffers and the
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
consequence of that service would they
 
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
rate this uh I'll give you in a quick
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
example I was in Afghanistan and I uh by
 
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
necessity needed
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
interpreters um because I didn't speak
 
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
the languages there uh and I actually uh
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
became very good friends with
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
African-American interpreter we actually
 
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:25.959 align:start position:0%
wrote a book together in fact I talked
 
00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
to him yesterday uh and so these perss
 
00:17:32.029 --> 00:17:32.039 align:start position:0%
as we call them uh we're not traditional
 
00:17:35.549 --> 00:17:35.559 align:start position:0%
uh American Service people but they wore
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
our uniform they were uh incredibly
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
important to our mission and uh when
 
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
when folks like those get broken they
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
may even be need more uh assistance or
 
00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
understanding than the traditional
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
veterans who are locked into like the
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
health system and the retirement system
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
and the benefit system so uh the these
 
00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799 align:start position:0%
contractors there's contractors of All
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
Sorts who help with our missions so
 
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
that's something uh that again that's a
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
great question and as the committee
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
moves this forward um the the role
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
that veterans courts might play for
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
contractors needs to be better defined
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
and there are some other folks going to
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
testify after me that are uh could speak
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
to that as well um so there is a need
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
for some definition great question
 
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
and hopefully that helps answer a little
 
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
bit other yes representative Greece
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
representative when a military person on
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
active duty uh does something out in the
 
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
civilian community and is charged by
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
civilian law enforcement may also face
 
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.390 align:start position:0%
civilian law enforcement may also face
at

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.950 align:start position:0%
at
simultaneously

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
simultaneously
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
charges within the
 
00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
military they're inde dependent of each
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
other the UCMJ is different from civil
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
law would this allow a service member to
 
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
be represented in the civilian veterans
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
court by the same Jag
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
lawyer uh would would there be any
 
00:19:18.149 --> 00:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
cooperation would there be any appetite
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
for allowing that because when a when a
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
service member has to have not only Jag
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
representation but also civilian
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
representation and you have to get
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
evidence or
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
whatever communication between the two
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
plus the expenses that may be
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
prohibitive for that service member
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
especially when he may be junior
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
enlisted so would there be any appetite
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
for allowing That Jag even they're not
 
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
even if that That Jag is not a rep a
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
member of the New Hampshire bar to be
 
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
able to participate and represent the
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
same service member in the veterans
 
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
court that's another excellent question
 
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
uh and you all heard the question has to
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
do with uh someone getting in trouble
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
with with civilian authorities off base
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh and the overlap or could a Jag Judge
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
Advocate U military lawyer uh work
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
outside the base so to speak so I I you
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
bring back memories of some of my troops
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
getting in trouble in town uh and
 
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
getting arrested in town for whatever
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
and then uh and when that happens it
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
happens all the time of course uh
 
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
especially with there are bases um then
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh how how is that dealt with if
 
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
somebody's in jail in town uh
 
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
then what do you do and and so typically
 
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
the commanding officer in some cases
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
like myself uh or wh whomever would uh
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
or have to go and bail them out or get
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
them out of jail so it there's so many
 
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
variables though it depends on the the
 
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
person depends on the the alleged crime
 
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
um and also this being New Hampshire we
 
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
don't have much in the way of bases here
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire um so the issue of
 
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who's on active duty
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
um getting in trouble and then trying to
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
figure out if a veterans court type
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
option would apply uh would not be the
 
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
same as common in New Hampshire as as it
 
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
would be where you have Camp Lun or Fort
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
Brag or camp penlon or whatever um so
 
00:21:27.549 --> 00:21:27.559 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I know there
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
some great legal Minds in this committee
 
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
and there folks coming up to uh testify
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
as well so uh great question it's so
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
again it's kind of a long answer I don't
 
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
know that that would apply much in New
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of the lack of bases
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
here representative
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you welcome to Judiciary um
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
I don't have a great judicial mind so I
 
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.590 align:start position:0%
I don't have a great judicial mind so I
need

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
help who would be the
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
judges in um a veterans treatment Court
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
well some the infrastructure for the
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
proposed veterans court is estab is
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
you'll find in the language of this
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
first bill um I
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
would as this gets developed if it gets
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
developed I I honestly would uh not not
 
00:22:24.669 --> 00:22:24.679 align:start position:0%
to pass the buck to the chair who has
 
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
has some in I think does have some
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
judicial great judicial experience um
 
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
some of the folks are going to follow me
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
as well as the chair I I think could
 
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
answer that much better than me uh
 
00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
another good question and rather than
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
try to answer it imperfectly when
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
somebody can answer it perfectly in a
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
little bit um I'll defer to to them
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
thank if I could follow up we're always
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
trying to have a more perfect union so I
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
I thank that uh thank you for that um do
 
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
you foresee the need need for specific
 
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
training for um the judges and other uh
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
um support for this sure the language
 
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
touches a little bit on that um
 
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
obviously there would need to be some
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
special you say special training um if
 
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
some sort of veterans court option is
 
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
established beyond what we currently
 
00:23:29.789 --> 00:23:29.799 align:start position:0%
have uh sure there would be some need
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
for some special special training or
 
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
education or or whatever for those who
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
are going to implement this option they
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
would need to know what a a veteran is
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
we're we're going to Define that here
 
00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
and and understand uh some some of the
 
00:23:48.269 --> 00:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
reasons why there would be a veterans
 
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
court like the reasons why there's a
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
drug court so how much of that would be
 
00:23:56.909 --> 00:23:56.919 align:start position:0%
necessary um I I would defer to the
 
00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
folks in the legal Community the
 
00:24:02.909 --> 00:24:02.919 align:start position:0%
judicial Community who uh would be um
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
putting this together if if it moves
 
00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
forward Mr chair could I ask one more of
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
course yeah um thank you um in the work
 
00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
that you did leading up to drafting This
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
Were you able to get any sense of um the
 
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
range the possible
 
00:24:24.909 --> 00:24:24.919 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
veterans who um
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh would meet the requirements to be
 
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
eligible for this court in New Hampshire
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
sure we got a broad sense trying to
 
00:24:42.029 --> 00:24:42.039 align:start position:0%
project uh how much business so to speak
 
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
the veterans court might get based on
 
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
numbers that we have of of veterans that
 
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
have been um you know charged with
 
00:24:54.389 --> 00:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
crimes before I I don't have those
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
numbers right at the tip of my fingers
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
but like I mentioned earlier like in
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
1998 there were 60,000 incarcerated
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
Vietnam era veterans so th those numbers
 
00:25:06.269 --> 00:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
are are out there and available and I'm
 
00:25:09.149 --> 00:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
sure that we can get those uh my sense
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
is not is that it's not a huge number um
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
the the number of veterans who would be
 
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
eligible for a veterans court option
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
should one be developed uh I don't sense
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
it be that big um but I can't tell you
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
at this moment I can't project a really
 
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
good number but based on what we've had
 
00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
in the past I'm I'm sure that we could
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
get to a ballpark figure thank you Mr
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
chair I just in the context for my
 
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
questions I I I just want to say that
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
when we spend a lot of time and a lot of
 
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
money to teach people how to kill others
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
and then we send them home and expect
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
them to immediately be be able to take
 
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
off one hat and put on another and
 
00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.350 align:start position:0%
off one hat and put on another and
function

00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
in our um in our in theory peaceful
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
Society that's a big demand that we put
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
on on primarily men but also women and I
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
am very sympathetic to that and if there
 
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
is a way for us to better um bring
 
00:26:20.909 --> 00:26:20.919 align:start position:0%
people back into society I would love to
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
find that way so I thank you for
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill forward uh thank you
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
representative and to your point
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh throughout history it's largely been
 
00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
young men as you mentioned younger men
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
who we sent off uh I was over 50 when I
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
went to Afghanistan and when you're
 
00:26:46.389 --> 00:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
older uh you have some uh emotional
 
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
armor inevitably we all develop over
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
time you know and so when you're 19 and
 
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
you're suddenly thrust in some of these
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
situations uh those are the ones that
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
more likely to come back uh broken in in
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
need of some um some special
 
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
assistance thank you other questions yes
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton and and then
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
representative Lonzo thank you for
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh two
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
questions um right
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
now we're about 20,000 short on
 
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
recruitment all
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
services but if we get into war
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
um it's going to increase uh the number
 
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
of casualties injured and
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
affected um and if we had to restore the
 
00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:42.039 align:start position:0%
draft um and go into a Warfare situation
 
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
like in Vietnam Korea or otherwise uh
 
00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919 align:start position:0%
this court can really be of value uh I
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
would imagine um in those circumstances
 
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
down the road in the future that's
 
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
number one number
 
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
two what using your your experience when
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
a soldier gets in trouble in
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
town um what happens is he on his own or
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
does a CEO come and bat for him and make
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
arrangements for councel how does that
 
00:28:16.509 --> 00:28:16.519 align:start position:0%
work sure uh another good question it
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
depends on what they did you know if
 
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
they get drunken in a fight and thrown
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
in jail which which is not unusual uh
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
that's something that the uh senior
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
enlisted in in the in officer of course
 
00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
uh are informed of um I'm thinking back
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
to uh more situ more serious situations
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
domestic violence uh un sadly is not
 
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
uncommon uh in the military community
 
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
and so if there is assault and injury uh
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
in that situation which is more serious
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
and someone uh
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
is incarcerated or jailed uh it's not
 
00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily as easy
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
if somebody's been injured or or shot or
 
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
or Worse to get them out of the uh
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
civilian authorities and onto the
 
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
military base so locally the the local
 
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
civilian law enforcement and the base
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
law enforcement obviously develop a
 
00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:18.039 align:start position:0%
relationship and again depending on on
 
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
the crime or the alleged crime uh the it
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
it sometimes it's easy to turn them over
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
to military authorities and sometimes
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's not it depends on severity of the
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
crime and and the local personalities
 
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
and and that type of thing if that
 
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
hopefully that helps answer a little
 
00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
bit J
 
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
L thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
taking my um question um so I was just
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
curious of have other states established
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
a veterans uh treatment Court yes thank
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
you for the question have other states
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
established veterans courts answer is
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
yes um in fact the uh the ncsl session
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
that the chair and I attended uh people
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
from some of these other states that
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
have have established this veteran Court
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
option uh described their experiences
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
and the value that that they believe
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
these courts brought to their states so
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
yes um other states do have this
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
option other other
 
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
questions oh yes representative trip I'm
 
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
sorry uh thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question question uh I
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
believe the number you give me is
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
probably what for for uh people that are
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
incarcerated V veterans would that be
 
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
Nationwide or in New
 
00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um well the the one number in
 
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:44.200 align:start position:0%
my testimony was from 1998 the big
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
number nationally of Vietnam erors who
 
00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
are incarcerated earlier question had to
 
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
do with like New Hampshire numbers
 
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
incarcerated or that we could anticipate
 
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
and I I don't have right at the tip of
 
00:30:59.310 --> 00:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
my finger so to speak uh really good
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
numbers I would want to give you on how
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
many are currently incarcerated how many
 
00:31:06.909 --> 00:31:06.919 align:start position:0%
we would project would be eligible for
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
the court not and again not every uh by
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
default not every military person would
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
would have a right to to the special
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
circumstances that a veterans court
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
would provide some uh it would be at the
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
discretion of of the courts as to
 
00:31:24.509 --> 00:31:24.519 align:start position:0%
whether somebody's individual case would
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
allow them to be referred to a veteran
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
Court similar to a drugs Court I I wish
 
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
they had good numbers uh and we can and
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
we can and we'll get you some numbers um
 
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
but I don't have them right- handy all
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
right well thank you very much other
 
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
other questions so you know I guess um
 
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
just maybe I can um I can answer one
 
00:31:45.549 --> 00:31:45.559 align:start position:0%
question or at least try to that uh
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
subject I know there are some people
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
here from the judicial branch who will
 
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm if I say something
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
incorrect but I think one of the things
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
that has always been sort of a pet peeve
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
for me and I I I sort of fought against
 
00:31:59.629 --> 00:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
against it a little bit uh originally
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
and then it just became clear that
 
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
everyone around the country was doing
 
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
was using this terminology so I I just
 
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
said it's not it's not a it's not a
 
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
battle I want to die not a hill I want
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
to die on so to speak and that is
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
referring to either the drug court or
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
the mental health court or the veterans
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
court as kind of separate courts they're
 
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
not really separate courts in the sense
 
00:32:22.029 --> 00:32:22.039 align:start position:0%
that we have you
 
00:32:25.629 --> 00:32:25.639 align:start position:0%
know uh they get a we we appoint uh
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
judges specifically to these courts or
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
it's another Court besides the superior
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
court or the Circuit Court it really is
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
a sort of a a um uh a docket in if you
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
will in the in the circuit court or in
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
this case it would be in the Circuit
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
Court Andor the Superior Court uh that
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
would be that would be treating these
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
kinds of treating veterans that were
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
eligible um and fell within the
 
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
parameters of the uh of the bill so it's
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
you know it it it colloquially so to
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
speak these have get gotten referred to
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
now as drug courts and mental health
 
00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
courts and and uh veterans courts but
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
they're not really sort of separate
 
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
courts I that that would be U the answer
 
00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:11.559 align:start position:0%
that I that at least my answer to what
 
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
the question that representative Smith
 
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
raised the other question I have uh
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative MAF and I'm I'm wondering
 
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
if if this might be something that um
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
you or perhaps the veterans community
 
00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
would be would be in the best position
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
answer with regard to representative
 
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
tur's question about
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
contractors um I I I see that the
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
definition right now says a current or
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
former mil U I'm sorry a current or
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
former contractor of the United States
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense and what I'm
 
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
wondering from I I assume from your
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
answer previously that you would be talk
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
you would want the the people that you
 
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
would want to capture to be eligible for
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
treatment in the drug court would be
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
people who were contractors who served
 
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
in for lack of a better term a sort of a
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
combat kind of situation as opposed to
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
if somebody's a contractor for uh for
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
the Department of Defense you know
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
working on making sure that they there's
 
00:34:13.069 --> 00:34:13.079 align:start position:0%
not a cost overrun and all they do is
 
00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:14.599 align:start position:0%
all they're doing really is sitting at a
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
desk at the Pentagon uh or some office
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
outside the Pentagon you don't you are
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
not intending to cover them is that
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
correct sure thank you for that uh
 
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
question yeah absolutely uh the courts
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
whoever the adjudicating uh person is
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
that looking looks at the individual's
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh conviction when it comes to
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
sentencing then they would have have to
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
you know listen to uh find out about the
 
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
background of the person as I said
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
earlier if if someone has never left the
 
00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
country Never Been In Harm's Way they've
 
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
always worked in an office environment
 
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
uh in my thinking they would not be
 
00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
eligible so much for veteran Court
 
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
consideration is someone who's been In
 
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
Harm's In Harm's Way to use that term uh
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
but again it be up to the to the courts
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
and I also want to point out that when
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
we speak of contractors many contractors
 
00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
not all but many contractors are former
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
military uh with some special training
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
and expertise so once they leave active
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
duty they are brought back as
 
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
contractees uh so a contractor um who
 
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
got in trouble as a contract cont ractor
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
not an active duty uh you know
 
00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
still would especially if they were a
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
former veteran um would I think rate
 
00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
consideration for a so-called veterans
 
00:35:42.069 --> 00:35:42.079 align:start position:0%
court and ter other other point and you
 
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
all can explain this about yeah veterans
 
00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
court there wouldn't be a veterans
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
Courthouse per se I think that's what
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
the the chair was talking talking about
 
00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
there's existing legal infrastructure or
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
judicial infrastructure Court
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that would assume the
 
00:36:02.589 --> 00:36:02.599 align:start position:0%
veteran Court U assignments so to speak
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh but no there wouldn't be a there's no
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal note to build a veteran's
 
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
courthouse so to speak
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
so other other thank you other qu yes
 
00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.190 align:start position:0%
so other other thank you other qu yes
representative

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
gon is it the intent of this legislation
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
to only cover veterans who have been
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
honorably discharged or would it cover
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
other than honorable bad conduct
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
discharges possibly even somebody who
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
was Court Marshal and received a
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
dishonorable dischar sure thank you
 
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
represent that's another good question
 
00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
there are different levels of discharg
 
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
most are honorably discharged but some
 
00:36:40.829 --> 00:36:40.839 align:start position:0%
are discharged under less than honorable
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
conditions uh you mentioned BCD bad
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
conduct uh discharge we call it a big
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
chicken dinner BCD um and then there's
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
Flatout dishonorably discharged who I
 
00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
who don't rate any uh help uh or any
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
benefit so to speak um that's the type
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
of definition that that the that's why
 
00:37:05.309 --> 00:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
this excellent hearing is identifying
 
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
some of these gaps in the language that
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
that can be improved so uh as to whether
 
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
somebody who received a discharge under
 
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
less than honorable conditions should be
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
eligible for this uh well some of the
 
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
again somebody who uh served their
 
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
country got broken overseas got
 
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
discharged under less than honorable
 
00:37:28.309 --> 00:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
condition they may be the ones who
 
00:37:32.589 --> 00:37:32.599 align:start position:0%
especially need a veterans court um so
 
00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
that definition needs to be forthcoming
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
great question uh and I know the
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
out other questions for this witness all
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much representative

thank you for taking my
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
question have you
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
identified any judges in the state who
 
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
are veterans who or who are sensitive to
 
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
the effects of combat trauma um that
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
might be suitable and selective
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
selectable for um these cases that
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
you've described for the court thank you
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
for the question in terms of identifying
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh judges or Court Personnel uh frankly
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
I haven't had that much interaction with
 
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
the judicial system uh for which I'm I'm
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
grateful and I don't know that many
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
judges I know a few I know one here so
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
to answer your question as to what
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
judges might be in the judges stable so
 
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
to speak who actually great question you
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
know uh I would think that a judge who
 
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
who had been a Jag uh uh Ronda sanis was
 
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
a Jag uh a military lawyer so a judge
 
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
who has that background I would think
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
would have that would be an advantage uh
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of how many there are um I'm
 
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
not sure probably the biggest
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
qualification would be knowledge of of
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
the law but if there are some judges of
 
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
military background I think that that
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
would be a plus I don't know how many
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
you all right other questions seeing
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much thank you Mr
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
Sher all right uh next I'm GNA call on
 
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:24.870 align:start position:0%
Sher all right uh next I'm GNA call on
Warren

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
Parry good morning Mr chair members of
 
00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
Warren Perry I'm the deputy adant
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
general for New Hampshire's Department
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
of military Affairs and veteran services
 
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
in that role we provide the services
 
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
that the state provides and oversee the
 
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
servic pro state provides to all
 
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
veterans in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
of which there are about
 
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
94,000 uh I want to take just a couple
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
quick uh minutes to maybe help address
 
00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that I heard today
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
and then just say that the department
 
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly supports the bill I think
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
there is some room for improvement in
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
some of the language particularly as it
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
pertains to the definition of veteran
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
our recommendation would be as in all of
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
the legislation that we see to use 2150
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
RSA 2150 as the definition of veteran as
 
00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
it applies to the state it's easy it's
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
there it's already in the statute so a
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
veteran so maybe some recommended
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
language would be a veteran is anyone
 
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
who meets the criteria as defined in RSA
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
2150 and that would kind of clean it up
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's 21 colon 50
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
yes sir I'm sorry I'm 21 50 uh and uh
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
you know it it it lays it out exactly
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
what the state considers a veteran and
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
it kind of it would clean up you know
 
00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:39.319 align:start position:0%
without going into all of the details it
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
would clean up the questions about
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
discharge uh and discharge status and
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
you know is is this honorably discharged
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
veterans or not discharged veterans and
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
then if there is some question of
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should consider all
 
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
regardless of their their discharge
 
00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
status then the the committee and the
 
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
will of the general court will kind of
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
figure that out you know what can I can
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
I just interrupt and I'm apologize but
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
just I just don't want to forget this
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
question with regard to the contract you
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
heard the testimony about the contractor
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering is there
 
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
some sort of Lang definitional language
 
00:41:14.589 --> 00:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
that's either in state law or in the in
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh title 10 of the US code that sort of
 
00:41:22.589 --> 00:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
talks about the kind of uh the kind of
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
contractors that we're talking about in
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
other words contractors that are in in
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
some kind of a combat theater so none
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of Sir right so I do know
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
that you know particularly as it relates
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
to interpreters right I I served in you
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
know in in Iraq uh twice in Desert Storm
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
and in operation Iraq freedom and our
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
interpreters were invaluable I would
 
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
stop what I'm doing right now and and go
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
find a boo and do whatever I could do
 
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
for him uh he was that valuable to me
 
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
and that loyal to me but no definition
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of defines contractors
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
that way and most of the contractors
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
that representative Moffett talked about
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
were contractors that generally work for
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
three-letter agencies right okay so
 
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily covered by the
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
Veterans Administration or the veterans
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Veterans Affairs at the at
 
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
the level they're they're working for
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
some other government agent to do a
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
specific purpose but you know it could
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
even be more confusing because the
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
National Guard of New Hampshire which
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
falls under our purview in the
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
department has contractors that provide
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
security at the gates at PE
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
and the way the bills written right now
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
they would be eligible for this I would
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
assume right they would be eligible for
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
this veterans court so uh you know my my
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
my two cents are we would leave you know
 
00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:40.359 align:start position:0%
if I was going to think of it that way I
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
would Define veteran the way 2150
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
defines veteran and render the
 
00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
contractor conversation mute mot all
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
right I'm sorry I interrupted you no
 
00:42:52.109 --> 00:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's perfect but I I would just
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
kind of leave that alone most of the
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
most of the guys that are doing contract
 
00:42:58.109 --> 00:42:58.119 align:start position:0%
work are doing things
 
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
covertly the the contract work that
 
00:43:02.589 --> 00:43:02.599 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett was talking about
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
so I I would and so as we talk about the
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
definition of veteran the another
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
advantage of using 2150 is it doesn't
 
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:11.839 align:start position:0%
create separate classes of veteran right
 
00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
so we we try to say that if if somebody
 
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
signs up they join the military they're
 
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
they're kind of writing that check and
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's really outside of their control
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not they go to combat or they
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
stay in the Pentagon or do whatever they
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
do they've all they all have that risk
 
00:43:27.549 --> 00:43:27.559 align:start position:0%
they say in the Marine Corps every
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
Marine is an infantryman right so
 
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
everybody H runs the risk of going and
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
and and serving and that risk is always
 
00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:38.559 align:start position:0%
there so we try not to in our department
 
00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
create separate classes of veterans we
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
don't say there's a combat veteran
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
versus a non-combat veteran we do look
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
at discharge we do look at discharge
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
status because certain benefits are tied
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
to certain discharge statuses so again
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
to be clear on the first part of my
 
00:43:56.109 --> 00:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
statement definition of veteran RSA 21
 
00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
one colon 50 and then no classes of
 
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
veterans and that just makes the
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
language easy and we don't have to go
 
00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
back and change this bill anytime we
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
need to change it so again I would say
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
that we we the department wholeheartedly
 
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
supports the legislation and not
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily everybody who comes in
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
contact with the justice system or the
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
legal system is eligible to go to an
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
alternative uh uh sentencing track right
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
so if you commit murder you're probably
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
going to go to the murder Court track
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
and you're going to be be tried for the
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
allegations of murder against you these
 
00:44:31.549 --> 00:44:31.559 align:start position:0%
these particular tracks in court whether
 
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
they're in the mental health court the
 
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
drug court or in the veterans track that
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
we currently use inside of the drug
 
00:44:38.589 --> 00:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
courts and mental health courts they are
 
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
for specific crimes or or brushes with
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
the legal system that we could find
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
beneficial if you had an alternative
 
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
sentencing uh uh track to go to right
 
00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
you had some alternative sentencing so
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
not everybody's going to qualify based
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
on what they do you know the benefits
 
00:44:58.349 --> 00:44:58.359 align:start position:0%
are we reduce recidivism we reduce cost
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
because people we aren't housing people
 
00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
in our other facilities uh we find these
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
alternative sentencing comes with
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
conditions and if they meet the
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
conditions we generally find a permanent
 
00:45:10.349 --> 00:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
change in behavior and we reduce
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
recidivism so there's a real Advantage
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
here to these systems whether they're
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
the mental health court the drug court
 
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
or for veterans so it's there's some
 
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
real benefits here and in these in this
 
00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
particular case the veterans would be
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
held accountable to complete these
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
programs and if they don't complete the
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
programs then their alternative
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
sentencing goes away and they end up
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
being sentenced you know appropriately
 
00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
by the judge and you know and what they
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
do so there's some real real benefit to
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
that so I would like to just and last
 
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
before I uh and my statement is just
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
address something that the
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
representative gon uh mentioned in terms
 
00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
of uh what happens if somebody finds
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
themsel in trouble they're still on
 
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
active duty or they're still serving and
 
00:45:58.510 --> 00:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
they have the possibility to be uh it
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
the consequences need to be levied in
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
both the military systems and civil
 
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
systems so in the military system it
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
won't happen right so if somebody's
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
being tried in the military Court they
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
won't go to judicial proceedings in the
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
civil court right because we can't try
 
00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
them in two places for their crime so if
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
there is some civil proceeding that's
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
going in a court matter the military
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
system may take some administrative or
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
non-judicial action but it won't be
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
judicial action so the alternative they
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
would still be available for the
 
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
alternative uh sentencing track in the
 
00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
in the civilian system but there may be
 
00:46:39.069 --> 00:46:39.079 align:start position:0%
consequences in the military which may
 
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
render their them ineligible for
 
00:46:44.109 --> 00:46:44.119 align:start position:0%
continued service or reduction in rank
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
but those aren't necessarily punishments
 
00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
they're non-judicial or administrative
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
actions so that's really kind of a
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
separate thing there's three things
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
going on you could be Tried by Court
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
Marshal you could be tried in a civil
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
court or there could be some
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
administrative action but you can't do
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
we can't try people in courts Marshall
 
00:47:02.829 --> 00:47:02.839 align:start position:0%
for the same crime that they've been
 
00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
being tried for in a civil court it's
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
kind of the principle of Double Jeopardy
 
00:47:09.549 --> 00:47:09.559 align:start position:0%
I would believe so so uh I hope that
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
answers or clears up some of your
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
questions pending any questions sir I'll
 
00:47:14.829 --> 00:47:14.839 align:start position:0%
I'll end my statement I know we're
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
getting onto time here and I want to be
 
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
brief great thank you uh representative
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
Smith um thank you you really helped
 
00:47:23.309 --> 00:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
answer a lot of questions and I have a
 
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
Layman's question um
 
00:47:29.309 --> 00:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
one of my colleagues uh in raising the
 
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
subject of
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
contractors um caused me to be a little
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
unclear about you seem to indicate that
 
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
contractors would not be considered part
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
of this because of the definition of
 
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
veteran is is is that that was my
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
statement yes ma'am so I'm going going
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
to say we are we are in agreement with
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
each other so I would say my
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
recommendation if the bill was to be
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
amended would use the definition of
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
veteran in RSA 21 colon 50 and render
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
the the discussion about contractor's
 
00:48:11.069 --> 00:48:11.079 align:start position:0%
mood that would be my recommendation so
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
that my concern I'm going to use a term
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
that might offend people and it's just
 
00:48:17.309 --> 00:48:17.319 align:start position:0%
because I don't know any better and I
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
apologize in advance and that would be
 
00:48:19.359 --> 00:48:20.710 align:start position:0%
apologize in advance and that would be
black

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
black
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
water um I want
 
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
to clarify that your interpretation of
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
this would not include people who were
 
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
involved in um in
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
nondirect military
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
structures that would be my that is
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
correct so the the F I'm guessing that
 
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:44.599 align:start position:0%
the folks that worked for Blackwater
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
worked for a three-letter agency not the
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
and the three-letter agency was not the
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
Defense thank you very much other
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:56.190 align:start position:0%
questions for this
Witness

00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir next I'm going
 
00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
O'Neal oh yeah thank you here we go good
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
morning my name is Jill O'Neal I'm here
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
today um sharing personal testimony and
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
not that of my employer and I'm going to
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
give you some context into my background
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
so give some Credence about what I'm my
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
testimony today um I 2014 I used to run
 
00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
the mental health court um for the
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
southern Hillsboro County um we use that
 
00:49:36.589 --> 00:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
Court program to Pilot the first
 
00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:39.799 align:start position:0%
veterans treatment Court um that's the
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
um beginning of my journey as um my
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
involvement with the New Hampshire
 
00:49:46.829 --> 00:49:46.839 align:start position:0%
Justice involved veteran task force that
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
task force charge it was a Grassroots
 
00:49:50.109 --> 00:49:50.119 align:start position:0%
membership we were charged with
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
supporting and promoting programming for
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
justice involved veterans today we're
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
here to talk about restorative justice
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
right so what we want to do is
 
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
understand what's driving legal
 
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
involvement right if there's a clinical
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
disorder then we want to divert into
 
00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:07.559 align:start position:0%
treatment corpse supervis ensure Public
 
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
Safety reduce recidivism so we all
 
00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
support that so Jill um so why not just
 
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
have folks be diverted into the mental
 
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
existing mental health courts or drug
 
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
court programs we need to understand
 
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
military culture what's driving right
 
00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:26.119 align:start position:0%
the iceberg behavior of theory looks at
 
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
what we see on the surface level which
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
is the behavior under sea level what
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
we're looking at is unique drivers
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
specific to the military population so
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
if we're going to effectively address
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
what's driving legal involvement we need
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
to understand military culture we need
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
to have Services we need to have a
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
support structure um so my journey with
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Justice involved
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
veteran task force was not only es
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
piloting the first veterans treatment
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
court but we were recognized as a
 
00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
national model I was invited and accept
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
Ed an invitation by Senator Shaheen to
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
testify on Capitol Hill in front of the
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
democratic steering and Outreach
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
committee to share New Hampshire's model
 
00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
so we had established legislation to
 
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
build a veterans treatment Court um
 
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
using best practices the 10 essential
 
00:51:13.789 --> 00:51:13.799 align:start position:0%
elements of a veterans treatment Court
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
based on the New Hampshire Buffalo model
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
and we were in full swing of that and
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
why we were recognized from a national
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
accredited organ accredited organization
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
Justice for vets which is spearheaded to
 
00:51:28.829 --> 00:51:28.839 align:start position:0%
provide free technical assistance
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
training and support to either for uh
 
00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
states to establish treatment courts
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
veteran treatment courts and to provide
 
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:39.640 align:start position:0%
them with ways to bring in training and
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
enhance their programs so what happened
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
and why they recognized us when I called
 
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
them before my visit to the capital he
 
00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
said Jill you in New Hampshire you have
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
it right you serve both VA and nonv
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
eligible or those that prefer not to go
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
through the VA so talking and attending
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
multiple um events here in New Hampshire
 
00:52:02.589 --> 00:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
and hearing from veterans themselves
 
00:52:04.349 --> 00:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
when we talk about Vietnam veterans
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a portion of our
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
military population that is otherwise
 
00:52:11.549 --> 00:52:11.559 align:start position:0%
seeking their services outside the VA
 
00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
system so we don't want to miss them
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
right we also want to make sure that
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
those that um are discharged for other
 
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
than honorable reasons for which there
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
was a case in nashaa through the veteran
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
treatment court that there's a safety
 
00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:26.839 align:start position:0%
net someone who served a tour of Duty or
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
tours of Duties that are otherwise
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
honorably dis dishonorably discharged
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
due to substance use disorder as a
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
result service related we want to be
 
00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:37.640 align:start position:0%
able to serve those individuals too so
 
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to support House Bill
 
00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
1589 with some revisions to the
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
definition so I went on this journey
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
Grassroots level to say we need some
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
ownership I'm seeing this model phase
 
00:52:52.109 --> 00:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
out our non-va eligible provider lost
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
sustainable funding they phased out we
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
continue to to carry on in serving those
 
00:52:59.230 --> 00:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
that are VA eligible I want to thank the
 
00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
courts the judges we have judges out
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
there dedicating docket time this is to
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
your chair Mr chairman your um comment
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
about it's not separate courts it's how
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
we arrange the court docket we're being
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
efficient and effective with our
 
00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:16.839 align:start position:0%
resources and so what we did is we
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
understand as a task force hey we need
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
some ownership and so I devised a
 
00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
strategic plan that I'm willing to share
 
00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
with you today that outlines a
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
coordinator if we do not have somebody
 
00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
that's working on this to help existing
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
programs enhance what they're doing to
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
bring in training and also to help other
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions establish these programs
 
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:37.720 align:start position:0%
we are falling short we are phasing out
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
we are serving a lower number than we
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:53:44.589 --> 00:53:44.599 align:start position:0%
serving additionally I presented uh with
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
along with the Justice involved veteran
 
00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
task force to the adant general of the
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire National Guard he said to
 
00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
the task force skin myself Jill you have
 
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
it right you have an impressive
 
00:53:58.270 --> 00:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
presentation you have a great plan but
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
you don't have data you don't have data
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
I don't see the need I don't see the
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
numbers so we said okay we need the data
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
as a task force as a volunteer committee
 
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
we reached out to the treatment Court
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
professionals and received the data and
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
so I'll share that with the committee as
 
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
well we looked at Branch who was
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
represented in terms of the Court we
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
looked at convictions what type of
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
convictions this is all Essential
 
00:54:24.789 --> 00:54:24.799 align:start position:0%
Elements for um running an effective
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
veteran treatment Court you're taking
 
00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
data you're applying it to address
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
programmatic issues and you're uring
 
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
diversion in a successful way so where
 
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to land with you is without a
 
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
coordinator dedicated ownership to
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
supporting these programs which are
 
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
highly effective then what happens is is
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
that we are in
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
intentionally not having an intentional
 
00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:50.559 align:start position:0%
referral process we're not looking to
 
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
expand programs and we're asking a very
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
stressed system to make it work work and
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
while we have very dedic a very
 
00:54:59.870 --> 00:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated Judiciary and very dedicated
 
00:55:02.589 --> 00:55:02.599 align:start position:0%
Court professionals um we need somebody
 
00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
in a position that's going to take this
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
as a priority and move this forward so
 
00:55:09.789 --> 00:55:09.799 align:start position:0%
we have data we've served from 2014 to
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
2019 that's as far as I could take the
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
data um we have served over a hundred um
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
military uh
 
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
veterans and um that's a low number but
 
00:55:22.829 --> 00:55:22.839 align:start position:0%
we have more that we could be serving
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
but there's no intentional referral
 
00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.670 align:start position:0%
but there's no intentional referral
process

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:55:27.789 --> 00:55:27.799 align:start position:0%
um and again this is no fault of anyone
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
it just speaks to the need for this
 
00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
position and so I'm here today just in
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
support of this bill to move it forward
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
and just employ to you that I've been on
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
this journey so it's not only just about
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
the language of who qualifies if you
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the structure the
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to support the programs
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
then we're not going to successfully
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
meet the needs thank you great thank you
 
00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative GRE thank
 
00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr J and thank you for your
 
00:55:53.549 --> 00:55:53.559 align:start position:0%
testimony excuse me in your pilot
 
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
program what has been the recidivism
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
rate so that has not been measured
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um again many of
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
these programs were just established as
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure the beginning
 
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and that's the challenge
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
is we haven't moved the needle in terms
 
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
of um and um making additional
 
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
enhancements to really running an
 
00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.829 align:start position:0%
enhancements to really running an
effective

00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
program all right other questions for
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%

00:57:39.029 --> 00:57:39.039 align:start position:0%
courts have been around since 2008 when
 
00:57:40.589 --> 00:57:40.599 align:start position:0%
they were first established in Buffalo
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
New York and our first one here got
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
established in
 
00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
2014 and then in what would prove to be
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
my rookie season here up at the State
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
House in 2017 session we uh moved
 
00:57:52.589 --> 00:57:52.599 align:start position:0%
through House Bill
 
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
652 which was signed by the governor and
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
took effect on the 1st of January of
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
2018 that established the framework for
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
for what we're talking about today with
 
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
the veterans treatment Court um we start
 
00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
out with one we're up to six across the
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
country there are close to 400 of these
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
programs across the country so we're in
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
very good company uh we support this
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
stuff I I'm sure that on the uh the
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
literature that you got from the
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
previous speaker that a lot of the uh
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
the nuts and bolts how many how how
 
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
large how fast questions have been
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
answered from our perspective whenever
 
00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:29.559 align:start position:0%
we have the opportunity to improve the
 
00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
life of a veteran and especially
 
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
veterans families we are literally all
 
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
about veterans families because our
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
motto is when one of us serves all of us
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
serve and if you in fact the whole
 
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
family serves so if you put somebody if
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
you incarcerate somebody who has an
 
00:58:47.029 --> 00:58:47.039 align:start position:0%
issue then them sitting in a jail cell
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
and then when they get out that that
 
00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
issue hasn't been solved and this is
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
this is an an attempt to bring together
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
all the resources to solve solve the
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
problem at the at the lowest level make
 
00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
the veteran accountable for the things
 
00:59:02.109 --> 00:59:02.119 align:start position:0%
that that veteran has to do in order to
 
00:59:04.589 --> 00:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
complete the program and then
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
potentially uh reduce that recidivism
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
rate that's really all I wanted to talk
 
00:59:10.109 --> 00:59:10.119 align:start position:0%
about I know we're behind time and there
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
are other folks here but we do
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support this bill right
 
00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:15.400 align:start position:0%

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:16.190 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much questions for
this

00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%

Alex cassal please I'm going to ask you
 
00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
to since you're both from the judicial
 
00:59:30.029 --> 00:59:30.039 align:start position:0%
branch and I think you'll probably be
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
complimenting each other with your
 
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
together hello again Representatives I'm
 
00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
Ain K I'm the general counsel for the
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and although I would
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
normally ask him to introduce himself I
 
00:59:45.309 --> 00:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
feel as though today I have to be Alex
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
cel's hype woman and say that he is our
 
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
new uh Statewide treatment Court
 
00:59:50.829 --> 00:59:50.839 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the judicial branch
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
overseeing all of our specialized courts
 
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
and he has a lot of have very deep
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge in this area so I've brought
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
him so that he could answer every
 
01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:00.039 align:start position:0%
conceivable question that you could come
 
01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:01.799 align:start position:0%
up with is that too tall of an
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
order slightly only slightly um and just
 
01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh say at the top I know your
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
your time's limited uh that uh we've
 
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
spoken to some of the judges that work
 
01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
on the existing veterans track and I
 
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
know that the feeling is that they they
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate the efforts that
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature would want to make in
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
this area to formalize the treatment
 
01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
courts more and to Resource the courts
 
01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
more uh so we appreciate your attention
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
to this area it's a very worthwhile
 
01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839 align:start position:0%
program many other states do have it um
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
and we'd love to do more in this area uh
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
so well all of the the policy decisions
 
01:00:36.349 --> 01:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
and the debates that we're we're hearing
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
today are are your particular uh issues
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
to solve we appreciate the work that
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
you're doing we think we could do more
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
in this area in the court system right
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
so you have provided um and I um I don't
 
01:00:50.589 --> 01:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
think that all me I'm not sure if all
 
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
members of the committee have gotten
 
01:00:53.069 --> 01:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
this but I know that I and
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
representative MAF at the prime sponsor
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
have gotten the uh the sort of redlined
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
proposed changes that you've made to the
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
language I I only got it l i only opened
 
01:01:05.789 --> 01:01:05.799 align:start position:0%
it literally this morning before I came
 
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
up and so I haven't had a chance to look
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
at it in great detail but my impression
 
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
is as as per the meeting which
 
01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
representative MAF and myself had with
 
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
the two of you um it sounds like what
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
you've done is basically sort of adjust
 
01:01:23.549 --> 01:01:23.559 align:start position:0%
the language to be sure that it's not
 
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.039 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
something uh W with some operations of
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch in some way and so
 
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
that it gives kind of Greater
 
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
flexibility um to be able to make sure
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
that this that the the veterans court uh
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
docket so to speak can be integrated
 
01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
into the judicial branch with sort of
 
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term minimum
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
disruption I mean is that would that be
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
a fair statement absolutely Our
 
01:01:51.309 --> 01:01:51.319 align:start position:0%
intention in giving you some feedback is
 
01:01:53.069 --> 01:01:53.079 align:start position:0%
to just to sort of familiarize you with
 
01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
the existing administrative structure so
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
that we can fold it in with uh without
 
01:01:59.470 --> 01:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
duplicating resources or anything of
 
01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
that nature um and I think that the the
 
01:02:03.549 --> 01:02:03.559 align:start position:0%
two particular challenges that we
 
01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
brought to your attention were that we
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
do have some counties that would have
 
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
relatively low participation right now I
 
01:02:10.829 --> 01:02:10.839 align:start position:0%
think Miss O'Neal's point is right we
 
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
can absolutely be reaching out to and
 
01:02:14.589 --> 01:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
targeting more people but it is a
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
smaller overall population than we might
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
be drawing into some of the other
 
01:02:19.829 --> 01:02:19.839 align:start position:0%
treatment courts and so we just have
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
some administrative challenges about how
 
01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
to serve um those counties and we talked
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
some ideas with you that I think would
 
01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
would absolutely work and that we'd be
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
able to implement and the other was just
 
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
a more kind of technical funding piece
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
on how we get federal grants to make
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
sure that we do it in a way that um
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
we're not kicked out for supplanting or
 
01:02:40.029 --> 01:02:40.039 align:start position:0%
or doing something that the federal uh
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
Grant manager sometimes uh can be a bit
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
picky about or could lose us the
 
01:02:46.589 --> 01:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get some grants so that
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
was the sort of nature of the feedback
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
that all right um Mr Cel uh please
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
anything you want to tell us uh
 
01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and members of
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
the committee um I like has has already
 
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
been said I'm the Statewide treatment
 
01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
Court coordinator um I've been before
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
that I was primarily just overseeing the
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
drug Courts for the judicial branch for
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
about seven and a half years and I was a
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
local coordinator of the drug court in
 
01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
straford County I was in straford county
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
for about 12 13 years so I have a a you
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
know history of working in the treatment
 
01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
courts most of the stuff that I planned
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
on either saying or addressing
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
fortunately because four or five people
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
have gone for me have already been
 
01:03:26.829 --> 01:03:26.839 align:start position:0%
brought up you know the justice for vets
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
the training um you know the the target
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
population whether or not a honorable or
 
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
dishonorable uh you know charge should
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
affect whether or not they are able to
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
receive treatment um most of the things
 
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
that I planned on talking about had
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
already have already been brought up so
 
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
I don't want to you know recycle all of
 
01:03:44.349 --> 01:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
that but if there are specific questions
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
about treatment courts in general uh I
 
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
can answer them as best I can questions
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
for um this witness um oh yes uh whoops
 
01:03:57.269 --> 01:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
M Mr are you going to be making that
 
01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
material available to yes for for sure I
 
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
am and and I I guess what I would say is
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
um it it it may be that that I or other
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee will may be in
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
touch with you just uh you know as we
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
kind of incorporate finalized language
 
01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
prepare an amendment that incorporates
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
finalized language um I suspect we may
 
01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
be in touch with you or representative
 
01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
mfet may be in touch with you also um
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
yes but absolutely um someone I'm sorry
 
01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
another qu representative
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
tur uh yeah thanks thanks for taking the
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
question just just quickly um on on the
 
01:04:33.549 --> 01:04:33.559 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard before from uh Mr
 
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
Perry about uh adopting RSA 2150 as the
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
definition um would that be consistent
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
with the population that you think
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
should be uh eligible for this or or are
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
you familiar with are you familiar with
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
it at all I was not familiar with that
 
01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
statute until it was brought to my
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
attention but the only thing I would say
 
01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
is we really defer to your judgment on
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
who you want to include
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
um we're going to follow your direction
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
on on it sounds like you do have some
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
some policy determinations to make about
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
whether or not you want to include
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
contractors uh that or whether you want
 
01:05:07.269 --> 01:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
to include people with bad conduct or
 
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
dishonorable discharges that does seem
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
like a a challenging policy question but
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to follow the instruction
 
01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
that you give us on the population you
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
want to include great other other
 
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
questions for these Witnesses all right
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate you being
 
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
here and thank you for your work on the
 
01:05:26.349 --> 01:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
with the suggested changes um I don't
 
01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
have any other pink cards on this bill
 
01:05:29.789 --> 01:05:29.799 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
1589 right seeing none I'm going to
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on uh House Bill 1589
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
1651 um relative to the to combining the
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
board of tax and land appeals and the
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:31.710 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
what's that yes it's a a little addendum
 
01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:35.510 align:start position:0%
what's that yes it's a a little addendum
or

01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:00.829 align:start position:0%
 
about

01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Dan Maguire I
 
01:07:07.269 --> 01:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Epsom um the bill
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
in front of you would combine the Bureau
 
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
of tax and land appeals and the housing
 
01:07:15.269 --> 01:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
appeals board into a single board with
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of both um actually
 
01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
with greater responsibility than than
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
they currently have jointly and um
 
01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going to assume for the purpose of
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
this discussion that you know roughly
 
01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:30.200 align:start position:0%
what those two boards do but if you
 
01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
don't please ask me a question I'd be
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
happy to answer so the Genesis of this
 
01:07:38.269 --> 01:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
bill was the budget that we worked on a
 
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
year ago and um I'm on the section of
 
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
the finance committee that deals with
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
the budgets of these two boards and uh
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
when they came to us
 
01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
in for our overview of their budget um
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of tax and land appeals told
 
01:07:58.990 --> 01:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
us that they were flat out that and they
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
asked for um some extra computer um
 
01:08:04.109 --> 01:08:04.119 align:start position:0%
software to help them with their
 
01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
scheduling and so on which we granted
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
them and and so they said that they were
 
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
very busy uh the housing appeals board
 
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
on the other hand came to us and said
 
01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
they would like more
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility so you can imagine how
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
unusual that is sitting on the finance
 
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
committee to have an agency come to you
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
and say we'd like to do more you know we
 
01:08:29.149 --> 01:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
we're not that busy and so um so that
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
was the Genesis of this idea was that
 
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
one agency they're very similar they're
 
01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
appointed in the same way they sit in
 
01:08:40.269 --> 01:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
the same building and so on they act in
 
01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
the very similar way um and they they
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
work on similar topics and so so the
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
Genesis of this was maybe if they were
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
combined that would be a little bit more
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
resources for the
 
01:08:55.390 --> 01:08:55.400 align:start position:0%
btla but but but also we could at the
 
01:08:57.309 --> 01:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
same time give a little more
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility in the area that the
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board works so um so the
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
bill the bill itself takes these two
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
three- member boards and makes them into
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
a single five member board um now let's
 
01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about detail um so
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
first of all I have to apologize the
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
bill in front of you is really poorly
 
01:09:25.709 --> 01:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
drafted I it's it's just that simple um
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
I got it uh I first read was able to
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
read it on the very last day of of the
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
signing period so due to the Log Jam and
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
OSS this came out like at the very last
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
minute and I simply had to sign it and
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
and Let It Go um but what I asked them
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
to do was to combine the two sections of
 
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
Law and since they're both written in a
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
very similar way I thought they would go
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph by paragraph and merge
 
01:09:56.189 --> 01:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
all the paragraphs but instead the way
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
they did it was they took the btla
 
01:10:01.149 --> 01:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
language and essentially pasted the
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board language after it
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
you know into one big section which is
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
really in my opinion not acceptable so
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
if you like the idea if you like the
 
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
concept here um and you want my
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
continued help I would be happy to get
 
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
you next week a a truly merged bill that
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
was you know worthy of being passed
 
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
which I don't think this one is but
 
01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
there there are two specific details
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
that I asked the drafters for that they
 
01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
did not give me um and I want to I want
 
01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
to at least mention those because even
 
01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
if you don't like the bill itself you
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
might want to incorporate there are
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
other similar bills floating around that
 
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
you're working on right so you might
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
want to sort of merge all those into one
 
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
big thing and so uh this piece of paper
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
I handed out um is is an unchanged
 
01:10:57.070 --> 01:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
section of the law dealing with the
 
01:10:59.070 --> 01:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
Bureau of tax and land appeals and what
 
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
it says is even though they have a
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
three- member board what they are able
 
01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
to do is for efficiency reasons only
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
have two members hear any given case
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
right so a case comes before it they
 
01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
could put two members on it um and if
 
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
those two members agree then the third
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
member doesn't have to ever be involved
 
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
in this work on this case but if the two
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
members disagree then the third member
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
makes the decision right and as I
 
01:11:30.149 --> 01:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
understand it the housing appeals board
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
does not operate that way at least the
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
way this bill is written this this
 
01:11:37.709 --> 01:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
feature would only apply to Bureau of
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
tax and land appeals style questions and
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
not to housing appeals board so I wanted
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
that feature two people hearing a case
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
and one person only if they disagree one
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
person making a decision to be in the
 
01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:53.560 align:start position:0%
combined board right and it's not
 
01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
written that way so that's why I handed
 
01:11:58.830 --> 01:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
this out the other one is um let's see
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
I'll find the page here um the is the
 
01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
fee so um if you read the bill they
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
change the fee for the for this whole
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
board to
 
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
$250 the current fee for the Bureau of
 
01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
tax and land appeals when you want to
 
01:12:18.669 --> 01:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
initiate a case is only
 
01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
$65 well it turns out it's been $65 for
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
40 or 50 years or something like that
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
right so it's it needs it's time for an
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
update um but it was not my intention to
 
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
update to to quadruple it to $250 it was
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
my intention to double it to
 
01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
$130 and
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
um and that didn't get into the bill
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
correctly um the housing appeals board
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
because it's brand new they their fee is
 
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
$250 and and which is the same as
 
01:12:54.629 --> 01:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
Superior court if you start a superior
 
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
court case it's the same
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
$250 um but it was my intention for
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
those style of cases to leave that alone
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
and the one last thing I'll say is um
 
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
right now the housing appeals board only
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
deals with housing related issues it
 
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't deal with other land land use
 
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
issues and it was my intention and I
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
think that is in this bill to to allow
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
them to to deal with appeals of any
 
01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
planning board or zoning board decisions
 
01:13:29.709 --> 01:13:29.719 align:start position:0%
not just specifically
 
01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for
 
01:13:47.229 --> 01:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question uh
 
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
the last thing you said was quite
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
interesting uh
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
because when you tie it in with the
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
first thing you said was that the
 
01:13:59.550 --> 01:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
housing pill board wants more
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
responsibilities they weren't very uh
 
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
specific about that were they at the
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
time yes no I think maybe I don't
 
01:14:11.629 --> 01:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
remember you hopefully there's somebody
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
here from from that group that can
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
answer but but the way I remember it was
 
01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
they could they did specifically mention
 
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
doing more than just housing right they
 
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
doing other kinds of
 
01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
appeals of other kinds of questions did
 
01:14:29.709 --> 01:14:29.719 align:start position:0%
they have any specifity as to what the
 
01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
other kinds of appeals would be or
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
whatever um not that I recall not you
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
know when we're dealing with the budget
 
01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
we don't tend
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
to I understand that but you know since
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
you are here presenting this bill I and
 
01:14:46.669 --> 01:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
and if you're asking for example the
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
bill that follows me is is is along
 
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
those lines and I am in favor of that
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
but it isn't the same it it isn't the
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
you I'm sorry I have just a couple of
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
questions um um I am I correct uh uh
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire that in this bill
 
01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
the the bill that is that is currently
 
01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:14.669 align:start position:0%
the the bill that is that is currently
before

01:15:14.669 --> 01:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
us does not include a change in the
 
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
manner of appointment is that right and
 
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's right right and and I have no
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
particular opinion on that I know there
 
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
are other bills and so my recommendation
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
to you guys is you think about this
 
01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
whole thing of the if you decide to
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
combine them maybe create one bill that
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
has all the features that you like right
 
01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
so if you if you decide to change that
 
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
aspect if you decide to change the other
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
you you put it into a single bill um
 
01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise if you if you don't like
 
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
combining them then
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
presumably you could have one bill
 
01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
related to the btla and one bill related
 
01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
to the house housing appeals board and
 
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
change whatever features you like in
 
01:15:59.199 --> 01:16:00.149 align:start position:0%
change whatever features you like in
those

01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:16:02.629 --> 01:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
bills sure okay and just so you
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
understand what what I what I was
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
talking about is there there is you may
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
know that there I believe there's
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
another bill somewhere that would make
 
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
right now that both the hab and the btla
 
01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
the appointments to that board are made
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
by the Supreme Court it's you know that
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
it that has always been something that
 
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
has bugged me a little bit because these
 
01:16:26.189 --> 01:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
people really are effectively judges and
 
01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
I it just I don't particularly like the
 
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
idea of Judges appointing other judges
 
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that it makes more sense
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
for the governor and councel to be
 
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
appointing judges um and I actually I
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
think um that the Supreme Court agrees
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
with that they're not so particularly
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
particularly fond of the idea of making
 
01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
those kind of appointments either I know
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
when I was on the Supreme Court I kind
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
of you know I I sort of felt that way
 
01:16:54.669 --> 01:16:54.679 align:start position:0%
but but I didn't think it was my role as
 
01:16:58.750 --> 01:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
a as a uh as a judge to be you know let
 
01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
that's for the legislature to decide but
 
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
now that I am here I kind of feel that
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to to change it yeah so I
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
I agree with you and I think you could
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
put that in here the bill itself this
 
01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
the the intent is about administrative
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
efficiency not about too much changing
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
the you know the details right so other
 
01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
other questions the only other thing I
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
would say just just for as an
 
01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
informational thing uh uh representative
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
McGuire is this I
 
01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
think if the board if if we were to
 
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
adopt this and the board were to become
 
01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.070 align:start position:0%
adopt this and the board were to become
five

01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:17:40.629 --> 01:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
members I think in that circumstance you
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
the the equivalent of of you know where
 
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
you say two members of the btla can sort
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
of hear a case I think it would have to
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
be three members of of that it would
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
have to be a majority other words in
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
order to have a quorum I think you'd
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
have to have a majority of the board in
 
01:17:58.830 --> 01:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
other words instead of five sitting on a
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
Case you'd have to have I think you'd
 
01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
have to have at least three um uh
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
sitting on it because it would be tough
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me it would be tough to
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
have less than a quar um well thank you
 
01:18:13.149 --> 01:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
for the question are you let me ask you
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
a question back is this a constitutional
 
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
issue or is this just something as a
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
matter of law because it seems to me we
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
could write it in the way that it's
 
01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
written now yeah no I don't think I
 
01:18:24.629 --> 01:18:24.639 align:start position:0%
don't think it would be a constitutional
 
01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
I think it I think it just might be you
 
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
know so so in my mind I think having two
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
only Mak sense it's it's it's uh I I I
 
01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
don't agree that that it would have to
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
be three okay all right yes uh
 
01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.510 align:start position:0%
be three okay all right yes uh
representative

01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
Smith this is really silly of me to ask
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
you a question
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
about quazi judicial matters since of
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
course you're the expert and I am not
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
but I'm just thinking of Courts of
 
01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
appeal where they uh don't they rarely
 
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
sit in Bank there might be three five
 
01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
seven nine members on the court but for
 
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
every any given
 
01:19:14.189 --> 01:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
case there are three members who meet
 
01:19:17.629 --> 01:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
and there's no need to have all the
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
judges meet and decide all the cases so
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that same rule apply
 
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
here I mean the concept I don't mean
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
rule no we could I know we I mean we
 
01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
certainly could do that that's why I say
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's a constitutional
 
01:19:34.510 --> 01:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
issue but I um it I think would
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
be a difference for both boards as I
 
01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
understand it from the way that they
 
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
usually operate in other words they they
 
01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
they U they generally don't have panels
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
I in fact I think the the housing
 
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
appeals board I think there's only three
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
members anyway that's right so um and
 
01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
and with regard to the board of tax and
 
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
land appeals they may do this to but my
 
01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
understanding is that's not sort of a
 
01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
their routine practice I understand but
 
01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
again this but you're right I mean I I
 
01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with you you're right you
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
you could do that I'm just uh questioned
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
about whether you know you'd want to do
 
01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
that but that was specific me my
 
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
intention was to as part of more
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
efficiency have
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
almost all cases first heard by two
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
people if they agree fine if they don't
 
01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
have a third one okay all right um one
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
other question I have for you on this is
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
I personally I think I I like the idea
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
of combining them I also like the idea
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
of having the governor and counsil do
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
the appointments but just one c one
 
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
question on
 
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
this is there an argument here that even
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
if we should do this maybe we shouldn't
 
01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
do it now and the reason for that is
 
01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
we've just recently established in fact
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
just like a month ago the governor uh uh
 
01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
appointed the first judge of the
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
Superior Court land you stock it would
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
it make sense to let that play out for a
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
year or two before we do this and see
 
01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
how what what the impact of that is um
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question I
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
guess I think of the Judiciary as being
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
extremely busy
 
01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
and and you know we did add this one new
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
Superior Court judge but but they still
 
01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
have a large backlog and so I think by
 
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
giving more cases more varied cases from
 
01:21:38.669 --> 01:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
other planning board and Zoning Board
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
things to this board that will tend to
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
draw a few cases away from the superior
 
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
court and help them make more progress
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
on their backlog so so no I I don't like
 
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
the idea of
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
all right other questions for this
 
01:21:58.910 --> 01:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
witness thank you very much
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative uh next I'm gonna call on
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
Hudson thank you Mr chair I have some
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony sure and I would also
 
01:22:15.550 --> 01:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
ask for Steve Hamilton to accompany me
 
01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
because um this is written testimony
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
from four of us and there's two of us
 
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
here today absolutely sure thank you so
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know what could I that's fine if you
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
just hand it out you know the only thing
 
01:22:27.629 --> 01:22:27.639 align:start position:0%
I would request is just in in the in the
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
interest of uh in the interest of
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
time uh we we will read your written
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
testimony so please don't just read it
 
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
to us again you know what I'm saying if
 
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
you have things to want to tell us we
 
01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
want to hear it but uh it would it's
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's not sort of very efficient to
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
just read your testimony okay thank you
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
I understand thank you very much uh for
 
01:22:47.950 --> 01:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Jim ISO I'm Chief
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
assessor for the town of Hudson and next
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
to me is Steve Hamilton and I'm the
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
president of Whitney Consulting Group I
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
provide assessing services to 16
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
communities within the
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
state and the other two um authors of
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
this letter are uh Scott Bartlett he's a
 
01:23:07.709 --> 01:23:07.719 align:start position:0%
chief assessor for the town of gwn and
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
Tom Hughes who's the chief assessor of
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
the town of molaro three of us not
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
including me uh a former btla review
 
01:23:16.110 --> 01:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
appraisers so they have a perspective
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
that others probably may not have all
 
01:23:21.149 --> 01:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
four of us have experienced a testimony
 
01:23:23.229 --> 01:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
at um cases invol ing the board of tax
 
01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
and land appeals um they're really the
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
single most comprehensive tax tribunal
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
that the state has they not only hear
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal property tax appeals current
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
use exemptions and the like but they
 
01:23:37.629 --> 01:23:37.639 align:start position:0%
also hear State appeals dealing with the
 
01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:40.280 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax uh business profits tax and
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
the like um so they literally have
 
01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
hundreds of rsas um that they are
 
01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for the appeals they on and
 
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
um they really have a lot of
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility they have a lot of
 
01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
history and they are are really unique
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
in their setup um we believe uh in the
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
state but handling tax appeals um I have
 
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
attached to the testimony a graphic that
 
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
shows over the last 10 years btla has
 
01:24:07.229 --> 01:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
averaged over 300 cases and um those
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
years don't include recession years
 
01:24:11.950 --> 01:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
right so in recession years as we know
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
um more appeals come out right and and I
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
believe in testimony you'll see later
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
you'll see some of those years of
 
01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
appeals come in um and uh below that um
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
bar graph you'll see the 32 different
 
01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
kinds of appeals that the btla hears and
 
01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
um that kind of um background that kind
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
of responsibility just isn't shared um
 
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
by the housing appeals by the relatively
 
01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
new housing appeals board um I'm going
 
01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
to 87% of the cases involve property tax
 
01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
but not all the cases uh at btla created
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
the same right an appeal involving the
 
01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
value of a shed is far different than a
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
reassessment order for a community um
 
01:24:53.229 --> 01:24:53.239 align:start position:0%
and uh so while relatively speaking um
 
01:24:55.229 --> 01:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
the the tax cases there they're quite a
 
01:24:57.149 --> 01:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
few of them uh the other cases do take
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
up a lot more exponential time um than
 
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
may maybe some of the property tax
 
01:25:04.189 --> 01:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
appeals of course not withstanding the
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
public utility appeals right we've had a
 
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
whole host of public utility valuation
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
appeals at the btla and those literally
 
01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:13.159 align:start position:0%
take weeks and months to work through
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
and that kind of background that the
 
01:25:17.149 --> 01:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
members in the btla and members that are
 
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
going to come on the btla are just not
 
01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
shared by the folks that would be
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
qualified on the housing board at least
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
in my experience I'm going to hand off
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
to Steve and thank you very much um so
 
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at the
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
3818 cases over the last 10 years
 
01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
3314 of them are property tax appeals
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
and as U Mr misho alluded to uh there's
 
01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
a a wide variety of those appeals there
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
is uh um The Smiths who um who are
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
arguing with the town over whether their
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
shed was torn down last year and should
 
01:26:01.229 --> 01:26:01.239 align:start position:0%
be taxed um sometimes these are
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
relatively minor dollar issues but
 
01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
they're very important to the appellant
 
01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
um and they do range up to uh very
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
significant properties uh that have
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
hundreds and millions sometimes billions
 
01:26:18.189 --> 01:26:18.199 align:start position:0%
of dollars in value and uh they take a
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
long time to process and and I think
 
01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.109 align:start position:0%
long time to process and and I think
importantly

01:26:23.109 --> 01:26:23.119 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
the manner in which these hearings are
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
held before the board of tax and land
 
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
appeals is distinctly different uh they
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
um they are in the denovo hearing U
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
process and the housing appeal board is
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
more of a review of a record of the
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
administrative agency below and
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
so the members of the board have to be
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
experienced in being able to uh hear the
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
testimony of witnesses and weigh uh
 
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
the that testimony and determine what is
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
true uh fact and how to apply the law to
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
that rather than the administrative
 
01:27:10.109 --> 01:27:10.119 align:start position:0%
review of a record from below which may
 
01:27:13.709 --> 01:27:13.719 align:start position:0%
be um a lot less complicated involve a
 
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
lot less
 
01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
time um the $65 filing fee is a pretty
 
01:27:23.109 --> 01:27:23.119 align:start position:0%
important uh thing to be considering
 
01:27:26.109 --> 01:27:26.119 align:start position:0%
should it be more I don't know but I do
 
01:27:29.070 --> 01:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
know that a lot of the cases that um
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
small individual taxpayers bring to the
 
01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
board are over relatively small dollar
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
amounts of taxes uh to begin with and so
 
01:27:41.149 --> 01:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
imposing a large larger burden uh May
 
01:27:43.950 --> 01:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
dissuade people from taking that step
 
01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
when it would result in a much uh better
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.119 --> 01:27:54.109 align:start position:0%
 
them

01:27:54.109 --> 01:27:54.119 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
I would say in in in closing um we do
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill uh the four authors of
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
this met the teleconference in email so
 
01:28:02.189 --> 01:28:02.199 align:start position:0%
while you don't see our signatures on
 
01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
here all four of us agree to this um
 
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
we're also not here necessarily
 
01:28:07.629 --> 01:28:07.639 align:start position:0%

letterhead on here um we're representing

purse that's why I ask you to sit down

because you know people are watching
 
01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
they they can't hear you if you're not
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
sitting down thank you thank you um I
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak with
 
01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
you this morning um just a very short
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
introduction I'm Teresa Walker I'm a
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
member of the board of tax and land
 
01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
appeals I was originally appointed in 20
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
2 um but I've been employed by the board
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
in various capacities um as of yesterday
 
01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
17 years um that is far less than our
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
chair Michelle LeBron um we also have
 
01:29:39.629 --> 01:29:39.639 align:start position:0%
with us our Clerk and an stelac and Eric
 
01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
W who was just very recently appointed
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
to be the third member of the board of
 
01:29:46.109 --> 01:29:46.119 align:start position:0%
tax and land appeals which were very
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
happy about
 
01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
um we listened to the presentation of
 
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire and we heard the
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
testimony of Mr Hamilton and Mr misho um
 
01:30:00.669 --> 01:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take an opportunity to
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
address a couple of the issues that Mr
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
Maguire ra representative Maguire
 
01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:09.350 align:start position:0%
Maguire ra representative Maguire
raised

01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
um he mentioned that the impetus for
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
this bill was to gain some
 
01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:16.070 align:start position:0%
this bill was to gain some
administrative

01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
efficiency we've spent the last month or
 
01:30:20.990 --> 01:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
so maybe a little longer since we
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
received the LSR and were asked to
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
provide a fiscal note to try to
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
determine if there was any efficiency to
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
be gained and we do not believe that
 
01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
there is we think um the two
 
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
boards handle very distinct areas of
 
01:30:46.750 --> 01:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um and they are not similar
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
other than the fact that they both
 
01:30:50.189 --> 01:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
occasionally deal with
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
land um when the board deals with land
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's about the valuation of
 
01:30:58.750 --> 01:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
land when the housing appeals board
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
deals with land it's about what a
 
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
property owner is entitled to do with it
 
01:31:08.109 --> 01:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
by right according to zoning and in
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
planning ordinances and and so forth
 
01:31:13.709 --> 01:31:13.719 align:start position:0%
completely separate and distinct bodies
 
01:31:17.310 --> 01:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
of law um well but doesn't doesn't what
 
01:31:19.030 --> 01:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
somebody is entitled to do with their
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
land have a have a bearing on what the
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
land is worth it very well may be in the
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
terms of determining highest and best
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
use of that land
 
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely um my background is valuation
 
01:31:35.109 --> 01:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
so I have enough I have enough knowledge
 
01:31:39.109 --> 01:31:39.119 align:start position:0%
of land use law to be
 
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous uh I consider myself to be
 
01:31:44.910 --> 01:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
valuation expert but uh truly would be
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
dangerous in the area of land use law uh
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
we're not sitting here before you to
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
tell this committee that we would not be
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
capable of
 
01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
learning um but we don't see the
 
01:31:58.590 --> 01:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
efficiencies to be gained and in fact
 
01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
there were conversations with the the
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
btla by the drafters of the original
 
01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that created the housing
 
01:32:08.350 --> 01:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
appeals board and one of the ideas that
 
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
was floated at that time was to
 
01:32:12.669 --> 01:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
incorporate those areas of jurisdiction
 
01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
into the existing Board of tax and land
 
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
appeals they were very excited that the
 
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
word land was already in the title of
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
our board um and just briefly the reason
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
the word land is there doesn't have
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
anything to do with property taxes it's
 
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
eminent domain cases that the board
 
01:32:35.310 --> 01:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
Heroes which are also valuation cases
 
01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
um forgot where I was going um oh the
 
01:32:43.950 --> 01:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
senator GA who was one of the Prime
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the bill that created the
 
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board his comment to us
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
was that the the mission of the housing
 
01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
appeals board was very distinct and he
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
wanted that board to be specialized and
 
01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
solely focused on those types of
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
cases he didn't and we had a
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
conversation about
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
efficiency and his comment to us was we
 
01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
don't want it to be too efficient he
 
01:33:17.629 --> 01:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
wanted a specialized board he wanted a
 
01:33:17.639 --> 01:33:19.510 align:start position:0%
wanted a specialized board he wanted a
dedicated

01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
board and and here we are now revisiting
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
that that same
 
01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
issue the the specific concerns that the
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
board of taxs and land appeals has asart
 
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
from the um the qualifications required
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
that are different from the members on
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
both boards um include and and some of
 
01:33:44.669 --> 01:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
it may be attributable to uh what
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire said about the
 
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
what his words were the poor drafting of
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
the bill um some of the language in the
 
01:33:56.910 --> 01:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
bill is very unclear as to what um he
 
01:33:59.669 --> 01:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
intended and how these boards this board
 
01:34:02.109 --> 01:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
he wanted how did how he wanted it to
 
01:34:02.119 --> 01:34:03.669 align:start position:0%
he wanted how did how he wanted it to
function

01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:34:07.229 --> 01:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
um we had questions and and concerns
 
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
about the Quorum as you raised uh uh
 
01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
justice Lynn um we had questions about
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
the the filing fee and how that it would
 
01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:20.360 align:start position:0%
impact some of the taxpayers that
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
appealed before app before us we truly
 
01:34:23.199 --> 01:34:24.270 align:start position:0%
appealed before app before us we truly
think

01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
that that the increase of that filing
 
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.590 align:start position:0%
that that the increase of that filing
fee

01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
fee
 
01:34:33.870 --> 01:34:33.880 align:start position:0%
would deter people from filing appeals
 
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
in many instances it isn't going to
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
deter um a utility or a large corporate
 
01:34:42.669 --> 01:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
entity like
 
01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:46.360 align:start position:0%
Walmart it would deter people who are
 
01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
filing appeals of a denial of a veteran
 
01:34:52.350 --> 01:34:52.360 align:start position:0%
exemption or a disability
 
01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
exemption um it would deter people
 
01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:01.639 align:start position:0%
filing the appeals of um elderly low and
 
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
moderate income uh and some property tax
 
01:35:07.709 --> 01:35:07.719 align:start position:0%
appeals and that's a great concern the
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
the btla was established to be a
 
01:35:12.750 --> 01:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
specialized board in a lower cost
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
alternative and more userfriendly
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
alternative than Superior Court the
 
01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:20.360 align:start position:0%
other issue that we have is as Mr
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
Hamilton mentioned previous viously is
 
01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
the different levels of review the board
 
01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
of tax lend appeals is a FactFinder and
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
our appeals go directly to the Supreme
 
01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
Court the housing appeals board is a
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
record review they don't have they don't
 
01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
take evidence they don't hear Witnesses
 
01:35:42.669 --> 01:35:42.679 align:start position:0%
um our board does we um if I could jump
 
01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
in the the um differences between the
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
two boards are the
 
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
timelines Board of tax and land appeals
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
receives appeals the majority of the tax
 
01:35:59.149 --> 01:35:59.159 align:start position:0%
appeals prior to September 1 and they
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
get processed and there is a very fairly
 
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
lengthy process of acknowledging them
 
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
confirming that they filed on the local
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
level and requiring mediation before the
 
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
board schedules a hearing
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
the and then someone would one of you
 
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think it was you at shamon
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
um that the
 
01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:26.990 align:start position:0%
um that the
board

01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
um now I lost my TR thought um the the
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
board acts more like a judge and once we
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
hear the case it's not over we have to
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
review all of the evidence and this will
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
there are days when this table would be
 
01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
full of evidence that we have to review
 
01:36:55.629 --> 01:36:55.639 align:start position:0%
and draft a decision that has board
 
01:36:58.590 --> 01:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
rulings findings and rulings that if it
 
01:37:00.990 --> 01:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
goes on appeal it would be appealed to
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
the Supreme
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
Court sometimes it's upheld sometimes it
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
isn't it's there are times when it's
 
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
remanded to the
 
01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:13.239 align:start position:0%
board we don't necessarily just sit two
 
01:37:16.510 --> 01:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
members many many times we sit three
 
01:37:19.870 --> 01:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
members because of the types of cases if
 
01:37:21.790 --> 01:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
we're hearing
 
01:37:25.629 --> 01:37:25.639 align:start position:0%
ever Source cases and there are 100
 
01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
cases that were filed that we have
 
01:37:30.910 --> 01:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
combined it may take six or eight weeks
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
to file to hear them and then it's going
 
01:37:36.669 --> 01:37:36.679 align:start position:0%
to take months to decide them so it's
 
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
similar to the the the Supreme Court
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
when they receive a large packet of
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
information that they have to review and
 
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
we all have to agree on it um we try to
 
01:37:51.589 --> 01:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
make sure that any decisions that we
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
make other board members are involved in
 
01:37:59.350 --> 01:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
because even if you sit to it could be
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
another board member sitting as a twers
 
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
in a subsequent case that may be similar
 
01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
and we want our decisions to be similar
 
01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
we don't want to decide one case one way
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
and a very similar case a different
 
01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:19.270 align:start position:0%
and a very similar case a different
way

01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
and we at the back I don't want to read
 
01:38:25.390 --> 01:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
the the packet that we gave you because
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
it is quite lengthy but at the back of
 
01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
the packet there are
 
01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
four um
 
01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
attachments one of the
 
01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:37.550 align:start position:0%
attachments one of the
attachments

01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
attachments
 
01:38:42.109 --> 01:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
is the um list of matters appealable to
 
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
the board and it's a page and a half
 
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
long so and and there are days when we
 
01:38:51.070 --> 01:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
get appeals we recently got business
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
business profits and business entity
 
01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
cases and that was the first time we had
 
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
had one of those cases so it took some
 
01:39:03.550 --> 01:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
time and at that time we didn't have our
 
01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
third board member he was just appointed
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
as of um
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
December I think it was well he he
 
01:39:17.229 --> 01:39:17.239 align:start position:0%
started January 12th um and we had been
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
without a board member for several
 
01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
months the the prior board member
 
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
resigned September 1st and the court um
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
and in the answer to whether or not the
 
01:39:34.350 --> 01:39:34.360 align:start position:0%
court wants to appoint they
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh advertised it and then it took them
 
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
four months to make a decision and
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
appoint a new member so M Walker and I
 
01:39:46.589 --> 01:39:46.599 align:start position:0%
basically have been sitting as a
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
two-person board for probably eight
 
01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:51.589 align:start position:0%
two-person board for probably eight
months

01:39:51.589 --> 01:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
months
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
um which is difficult so if you the the
 
01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%
best thing I can advise you to look at
 
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
is the filing deadlines the sheet that
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
shows the processing of the appeals and
 
01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
the sheet that pretty much I think what
 
01:40:10.830 --> 01:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
Mr um Hamilton was referring to was
 
01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
total F total appeals
 
01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:15.470 align:start position:0%
total F total appeals
filed

01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
filed
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
we we are very busy and I think Mr
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
Maguire acknowledge that that's what we
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
said when we went to the legislature for
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
the budget we don't have enough staff
 
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
our clerk is overwhelmed with work and
 
01:40:35.950 --> 01:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
thankfully she's a multitasker and she
 
01:40:39.629 --> 01:40:39.639 align:start position:0%
just keeps up with it uh but we were
 
01:40:43.589 --> 01:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
looking for more staff not more
 
01:40:46.589 --> 01:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility because quite frankly we
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
just don't have the time and we think
 
01:40:52.709 --> 01:40:52.719 align:start position:0%
that the the cross over on appeal
 
01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:55.159 align:start position:0%
timelines would have a big effect and
 
01:40:57.229 --> 01:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
the board would have a lot of difficulty
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
in trying to coordinate those those two
 
01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
types of
 
01:41:05.550 --> 01:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
appeals as well as in my last statement
 
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure M Walker wants to say some
 
01:41:11.550 --> 01:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
more uh we have a docket tracking system
 
01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
that we set up years ago and it's
 
01:41:18.109 --> 01:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
wonderful docket tracking system it's my
 
01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
understanding the housing appeals board
 
01:41:21.390 --> 01:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
uses team
 
01:41:23.709 --> 01:41:23.719 align:start position:0%
to keep track of their appeals which
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
means our docket tracking system would
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
have to be totally revised and it would
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
be extremely costly to do it um
 
01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
so we don't see any efficiency in this
 
01:41:40.750 --> 01:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
bill we think
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's I I agree with you that it may be
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
better to wait a year year or two to see
 
01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
how the land cord is is operating
 
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
because our understanding from the
 
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
former chair of the housing appeals
 
01:41:59.790 --> 01:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
board stated they receive about 40
 
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
appeals a
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
year and she has since resigned as well
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
and the attorney member is now the land
 
01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:11.719 align:start position:0%
Court uh judge so right now they're
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
operating with one board member and
 
01:42:13.679 --> 01:42:14.870 align:start position:0%
operating with one board member and
temporary

01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
01:42:18.510 --> 01:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
members but I trying to combine the two
 
01:42:22.030 --> 01:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
I think is going to be more
 
01:42:25.149 --> 01:42:25.159 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
um confusion more more
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
expensive we would need a lot more staff
 
01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
than we have
 
01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
so my I will say for myself I don't
 
01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
support the bill I think my fellow board
 
01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
members agree with me but I'll let Miss
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
Walker speak from here I I do agree I do
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
not support the bill I don't see the
 
01:42:50.159 --> 01:42:51.550 align:start position:0%
not support the bill I don't see the
efficiency

01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
I don't see any potential cost savings
 
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
um and the last issue I would like to
 
01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
bring up and it's going to sound Petty
 
01:43:03.390 --> 01:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
but it it's not meant to be
 
01:43:07.589 --> 01:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
is they proposed changing the name of
 
01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:11.320 align:start position:0%
the board and removing the word tax from
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
the title of the
 
01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:15.310 align:start position:0%
the title of the
board

01:43:15.310 --> 01:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
um it would make that extremely
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
difficult for most taxpayers to figure
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
out where they could go to file an
 
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
appeal if there were taxes removed from
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
the title of the proposed combined board
 
01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
um as you'll see in the exhibits by far
 
01:43:34.109 --> 01:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
the majority of the appeals that we
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
receive are tax Rel or property tax
 
01:43:39.589 --> 01:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
related and then the other state taxes
 
01:43:42.189 --> 01:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
make up another decent percentage of
 
01:43:44.910 --> 01:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
them so I think from a practical
 
01:43:47.310 --> 01:43:47.320 align:start position:0%
perspective and serving the citizens of
 
01:43:49.229 --> 01:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire keeping the
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
word tax and the title would be
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
imperative all right thank you questions
 
01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
for these
 
01:44:00.189 --> 01:44:00.199 align:start position:0%
Witnesses seeing none yeah I I I just
 
01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
want to take a moment just for for to
 
01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
stay publicly Mr LeBron I want to really
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%

don't remember me but I remember you
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
going back to the
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
1980s when I was working at Cleveland
 
01:44:17.709 --> 01:44:17.719 align:start position:0%
Waters and George manast who was became
 
01:44:19.950 --> 01:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
later became a judge did a lot of
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
eminent domain work and I remember that
 
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
you were at that time a clerk at the
 
01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
board of tax and land appeals and you
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
worked your way up and from I have never
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
heard anyone say anything other than
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
give you the highest ACC accolades for
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
your service to the state over all these
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
many years um so representative LD she's
 
01:44:44.270 --> 01:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
also the longest serving state employee
 
01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
at this point in time is that right well
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
congratulations I really congratulate
 
01:44:51.550 --> 01:44:51.560 align:start position:0%

chairman Lynn I do remember you I I I
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
didn't think you would remember me from
 
01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
when I was the CH the clerk of that
 
01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
board but it was it was quite the board
 
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
and uh George Manus was a Wonder
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%

01:45:14.189 --> 01:45:14.199 align:start position:0%
judge ironically I spoke with him
 
01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
shortly before he died and he and aab
 
01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
bean sure were who it was is also a
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner on the eminent domain
 
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
commission the three of us were going to
 
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
go to lunch together and unfortunately
 
01:45:33.070 --> 01:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
it didn't work out but yes I do remember
 
01:45:35.709 --> 01:45:35.719 align:start position:0%
you thank you all right thank you so
 
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony next I'm going
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
conquer

01:45:57.030 --> 01:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:58.109 --> 01:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
you know can I put you ask you to put
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
your mic that thank you sorry about that
 
01:46:03.709 --> 01:46:03.719 align:start position:0%
my name is Todd Haywood I am also an
 
01:46:06.669 --> 01:46:06.679 align:start position:0%
assessor um I have have a consulting
 
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
company that does the assessing for 10
 
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
Towns and um I'm representing myself
 
01:46:14.589 --> 01:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
today um I think representative Maguire
 
01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.639 align:start position:0%
um presented the
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill very well and conceptually uh I'm
 
01:46:25.870 --> 01:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh I'm in favor of of
 
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
streamlining the process or finding
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
efficiencies in government um the one
 
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is to add to what my
 
01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
colleagues had said is a btla does does
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
provide a valuable service and I think
 
01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
as long as you can maintain that level
 
01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
of service and then find some
 
01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
efficiencies I think that's it makes
 
01:46:51.550 --> 01:46:51.560 align:start position:0%
sense to me
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
um each of the two boards in question do
 
01:46:58.589 --> 01:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
have uh subject matter experts so if you
 
01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
combine the two boards you'll still
 
01:47:03.589 --> 01:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
maintain the subject matter experts as
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
as part of those boards not everyone
 
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
will have the same level of expertise in
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
every case but still I think it it would
 
01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:14.629 align:start position:0%
every case but still I think it it would
suffice

01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
suffice
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
so uh that's really all I have to add I
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
agree with pretty much all the testimony
 
01:47:22.750 --> 01:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
so far and um I'd be happy to answer
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any questions for
 
01:47:25.119 --> 01:47:26.189 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any questions for
this

01:47:26.189 --> 01:47:26.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
sir thank you uh next I will call on um
 
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
Please Mr chairman members of the board
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
um my name is Philip Sherman I'm chair
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
of the building code review board we
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
write the building codes for the state
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
for ratification by the legislature
 
01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully signature by the governor uh I
 
01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
speak in respectful opposition to the
 
01:48:05.310 --> 01:48:05.320 align:start position:0%
bill as it's written uh this comes up
 
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
because many of the municipal
 
01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities related to building
 
01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
codes still reside in in the
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
670 and so forth series of of
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
rsas um and by extending the
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of this board to all
 
01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
housing related matters the result is a
 
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
conflict with well-established
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
procedures for appeals to the State
 
01:48:30.790 --> 01:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
Building Code currently a person
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
disagreeing with a local building
 
01:48:34.709 --> 01:48:34.719 align:start position:0%
inspector or in fact the local Fire
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
Authority appeals to the local board of
 
01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:40.719 align:start position:0%
appeals and this appeal this this local
 
01:48:44.669 --> 01:48:44.679 align:start position:0%
board may be a specialized board it may
 
01:48:47.070 --> 01:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
be the the zoning Board of adjustment
 
01:48:49.109 --> 01:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
therefore the the issue here or it may
 
01:48:51.589 --> 01:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
be the selectman the appeals route from
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
the local board is to the building code
 
01:48:55.709 --> 01:48:55.719 align:start position:0%
Board of repeals which brings it to the
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
state level where we hear a very small
 
01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
number of appeals each year and the
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
appeals from the bcrb is to the Superior
 
01:49:06.350 --> 01:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
Court um this bill as written would
 
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
inject persons who may have little or no
 
01:49:10.350 --> 01:49:10.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge of building codes into a
 
01:49:12.669 --> 01:49:12.679 align:start position:0%
process that competes and perhaps
 
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
conflicts with the local code appeals
 
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
board the bcrb and the court I Su uh
 
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest that the proposed
 
01:49:24.430 --> 01:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
Bill be amended to state that the duties
 
01:49:27.229 --> 01:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
of this new board do not include
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
decisions related to the State Building
 
01:49:31.629 --> 01:49:31.639 align:start position:0%
Code or the state fire code and let them
 
01:49:34.270 --> 01:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
proceed uh the way other rsas deal with
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
them currently and I'm happy to answer
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
any questions questions for this witness
 
01:49:42.830 --> 01:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
so can I just ask you sir I just if if
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
we were and I'm I I know I'm I'm sure
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
that I'm oversimplifying here a bit but
 
01:49:51.709 --> 01:49:51.719 align:start position:0%
if we were to amend the
 
01:49:54.870 --> 01:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
bill essentially to
 
01:49:58.589 --> 01:49:58.599 align:start position:0%
say there what was formerly the uh
 
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board and on the one
 
01:50:02.189 --> 01:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
hand and the board of tax and land
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
appeals on the other hand are hereby
 
01:50:08.669 --> 01:50:08.679 align:start position:0%
combined and the jurisdiction of this
 
01:50:13.109 --> 01:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
combined board shall be and again I'm
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
this language I'd have to finesse the
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
language but the jurisdiction of this
 
01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
board shall be the same as the Juris
 
01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
ition of the former Board of tax and
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
land appeals and the board of uh and the
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board so that there was
 
01:50:30.750 --> 01:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
no change in other words the the the
 
01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
appeals process didn't change at all
 
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
except that you now both of them go to
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
this one board would would that would
 
01:50:43.390 --> 01:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
that satisfy your concern I think my
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
concern resides in the current housing
 
01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
appeals board RSA which is being brought
 
01:50:52.109 --> 01:50:52.119 align:start position:0%
into this this discussion I think it's a
 
01:50:54.510 --> 01:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
problem today the way the RSA is written
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
or a potential problem as others have
 
01:50:59.069 --> 01:50:59.079 align:start position:0%
said this is not played out over time
 
01:51:01.149 --> 01:51:01.159 align:start position:0%
enough to know where where it could head
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
but um okay so okay I I see I'm I I just
 
01:51:07.149 --> 01:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
I guess I did Mis comes from the section
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
that talks about other Municipal permits
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
which is massive right it goes to
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
everywhere okay all right well thank no
 
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification uh
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
questions from members of the
 
01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
committee done thank you very much sir
 
01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:26.440 align:start position:0%

01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
from Chris bolt I'm sorry Chris Bol
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:42.910 --> 01:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
that for the record I'm Chris bolt I'm a
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
partner Donna hu Tucker chandela uh I am
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
a lawyer who appears before both boards
 
01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh um when I first heard of this bill
 
01:51:55.950 --> 01:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
last week I in a list serve I gave five
 
01:51:59.950 --> 01:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
words in response what an incredibly bad
 
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
idea not meaning to be flipping with all
 
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
du deference to the uh to the drafters
 
01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
you have two very distinct boards the
 
01:52:12.270 --> 01:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
only commonality is the word
 
01:52:15.550 --> 01:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
land you have a new board in the
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
habb relatively new two years by Statute
 
01:52:22.109 --> 01:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
it has to have three bodies one a
 
01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
realtor two a surveyor three a
 
01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
lawyer those are the skills that the
 
01:52:33.390 --> 01:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
legislature decided were needed for the
 
01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board to address in a
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
faster fashion than the court things
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
like zoning
 
01:52:45.550 --> 01:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
variances subdivision approvals or
 
01:52:47.790 --> 01:52:47.800 align:start position:0%
denials originally the bill was
 
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
targeting Workforce housing it was
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
morphed over the year over the time
 
01:52:55.709 --> 01:52:55.719 align:start position:0%
period to expand it to
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
General that has nothing with all due
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
difference Mr chairman to do with the
 
01:53:05.470 --> 01:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
scope of the btla I have appeared before
 
01:53:08.189 --> 01:53:08.199 align:start position:0%
the btla for most of my practice here in
 
01:53:12.270 --> 01:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
the state it I've had uh both sides of
 
01:53:14.470 --> 01:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
the aisle representing municipalities
 
01:53:17.629 --> 01:53:17.639 align:start position:0%
and private property owners it is a
 
01:53:20.189 --> 01:53:20.199 align:start position:0%
specialized board with specialized skill
 
01:53:22.430 --> 01:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
and God love them they do it I may not
 
01:53:24.510 --> 01:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
agree with all their decisions but they
 
01:53:28.109 --> 01:53:28.119 align:start position:0%
work hard and it is something that I
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
have had cases those big utility cases
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
where we're representing a 100
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities sued by
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
PSNH it took us
 
01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
weeks okay and that went up to the
 
01:53:42.750 --> 01:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
Supremes we succeeded there it is one
 
01:53:47.229 --> 01:53:47.239 align:start position:0%
where they do a good job it is not one
 
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
where I think efficiency will result I
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
think you will actually have a decrease
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
in efficiency because you will screw up
 
01:53:56.310 --> 01:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
the works of what the btla is actually
 
01:53:59.229 --> 01:53:59.239 align:start position:0%
doing we have the new land use docket as
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
was previously stated that has just come
 
01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
into play that is a rocket docket ladies
 
01:54:07.109 --> 01:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
and gentlemen that is 60 days from the
 
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
from the certified record to having a
 
01:54:10.990 --> 01:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
status conference 60 days from the
 
01:54:13.069 --> 01:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
status conference to having a hearing
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
and 60 days from a hearing to having a
 
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
decision that is fast that is very fast
 
01:54:24.069 --> 01:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
that may well take the place of the habb
 
01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know yet but it is one where I
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
think this bill should be
 
01:54:34.629 --> 01:54:34.639 align:start position:0%
itl I'll leave you with this and I'm not
 
01:54:36.270 --> 01:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
meaning to be the southbound end of a
 
01:54:39.310 --> 01:54:39.320 align:start position:0%
Northbound horse but as I thought about
 
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
this bill more I thought about the old
 
01:54:45.149 --> 01:54:45.159 align:start position:0%
Saturday Night Live skit back in the mid
 
01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
60s mid 70s excuse me with Chevy Chase
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
and gildner Radner
 
01:54:53.550 --> 01:54:53.560 align:start position:0%
Sparkle it's a whip topping no it's a
 
01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
floor polish you're both right we can't
 
01:54:59.669 --> 01:54:59.679 align:start position:0%
be both right for this board leave the
 
01:55:03.069 --> 01:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
two separated itl this one happy to take
 
01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440 align:start position:0%

01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
hard to

follow uh I'm Ben Frost I'm the deputy
 
01:55:29.189 --> 01:55:29.199 align:start position:0%
executive director and chief legal
 
01:55:30.990 --> 01:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
officer for New Hampshire housing it's
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
an pleasure and honor to be before your
 
01:55:35.229 --> 01:55:35.239 align:start position:0%
committee again Mr chairman I I speak in
 
01:55:38.669 --> 01:55:38.679 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill uh 1651 I I do
 
01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
want to thank representative McGuire
 
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
though for his his openness to ideas uh
 
01:55:46.629 --> 01:55:46.639 align:start position:0%
and I I think he expressed that um
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
admirably um he did comment on the the
 
01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
Genesis of this idea and that was in
 
01:55:57.069 --> 01:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
budgetary discussions uh last year when
 
01:55:59.470 --> 01:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
then uh housing appeals board chair Beth
 
01:56:03.669 --> 01:56:03.679 align:start position:0%
Fischer now retired uh appeared um
 
01:56:06.589 --> 01:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
before his uh his committee uh division
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
one I believe house finance uh she also
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
appeared before the Senate finance
 
01:56:13.589 --> 01:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
committee and talked about the the
 
01:56:17.069 --> 01:56:17.079 align:start position:0%
docket of the housing appeals board and
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
it was her testimony I've so
 
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
subsequently spoken with her uh to
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
confirm this her testimony then was um
 
01:56:28.430 --> 01:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
not based on the idea that the housing
 
01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
appeals board didn't have enough to do
 
01:56:32.990 --> 01:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
and was looking for more to do but
 
01:56:36.069 --> 01:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
rather it's a matter of perspective uh
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
that there is there was uh capacity to
 
01:56:39.679 --> 01:56:40.629 align:start position:0%
that there is there was uh capacity to
take

01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:40.639 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:56:45.790 --> 01:56:45.800 align:start position:0%
on uh a broader jurisdiction meaning all
 
01:56:46.990 --> 01:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
land use
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
decisions uh consistent with
 
01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.109 align:start position:0%
decisions uh consistent with
the

01:56:51.109 --> 01:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
specialization uh with which the housing
 
01:56:55.149 --> 01:56:55.159 align:start position:0%
appeals board was originally designed
 
01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:57.639 align:start position:0%
and I I will I confess I was the
 
01:57:00.149 --> 01:57:00.159 align:start position:0%
original drafter of it back in 2008 I
 
01:57:03.030 --> 01:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
wrote it for Senator GAA uh and he
 
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
introduced that legislation um it's
 
01:57:08.229 --> 01:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
designed to be a specialized board as
 
01:57:11.229 --> 01:57:11.239 align:start position:0%
you have heard uh and and it has served
 
01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
that function for the past three years
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
very well um then chair Fischer's
 
01:57:20.030 --> 01:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
testimony was based on the idea that
 
01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
well should we be
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
mirroring the jurisdiction of the land
 
01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
use docket as then proposed uh and now
 
01:57:30.830 --> 01:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
now it is Law and I think that's a
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
really great step forward uh we look at
 
01:57:37.149 --> 01:57:37.159 align:start position:0%
this drive towards
 
01:57:39.189 --> 01:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
specialization occurring also in the
 
01:57:42.430 --> 01:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Mr chairman with specialized
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
dockets in the Superior Court thus the
 
01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
need for the land use docket to impart
 
01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
um consistency of decisionmaking in
 
01:57:55.709 --> 01:57:55.719 align:start position:0%
these specialized fields of law the
 
01:57:57.629 --> 01:57:57.639 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board serves that
 
01:58:01.069 --> 01:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
function as well the btla serves that
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
function as well because of its
 
01:58:06.790 --> 01:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
specialization and expertise um and I
 
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
want to confirm uh the testimony from
 
01:58:11.870 --> 01:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
the members of the btla uh their
 
01:58:14.350 --> 01:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
comments their recitation of what
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
Senator GAA said is dead on accurate I
 
01:58:18.430 --> 01:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
was there I heard the same comments from
 
01:58:21.550 --> 01:58:21.560 align:start position:0%
him uh there was a real strong desire
 
01:58:23.069 --> 01:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:58:24.990 --> 01:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
specialization U I think it would be
 
01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
important to uh give some time to see
 
01:58:30.149 --> 01:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
what the impact is of the land use
 
01:58:32.990 --> 01:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
docket although you might recall last
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
year and I think it was on that bill Mr
 
01:58:37.629 --> 01:58:37.639 align:start position:0%
chairman when uh Attorney Richard headed
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
representing the judicial branch said
 
01:58:42.750 --> 01:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
that with the Advent of the housing
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
appeals board there had been no decrease
 
01:58:47.149 --> 01:58:47.159 align:start position:0%
in the number of cases that the suprior
 
01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
court uh courts were hearing on land use
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
appeals uh meaning I think you could
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
conclude that there the housing appeals
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
board is meeting
 
01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
a what was previously latent demand for
 
01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
appeals or access to Justice they were
 
01:59:05.990 --> 01:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
hearing appeals that would not have gone
 
01:59:10.109 --> 01:59:10.119 align:start position:0%
forward because of the cost difficulty
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
of um ordinary people uh trying cases
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
before suprior court uh it's not for the
 
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
faint of heart not that the housing
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
appeals board is easy
 
01:59:21.750 --> 01:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's not because it applies the same
 
01:59:24.270 --> 01:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
legal standard that Superior Courts do
 
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
but it is a an easier process um because
 
01:59:30.430 --> 01:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
of the way it's set up and is designed
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
to be that way and I think that gets to
 
01:59:35.189 --> 01:59:35.199 align:start position:0%
the filing fee question too I I do not
 
01:59:37.750 --> 01:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
um uh recommend increasing the filing
 
01:59:40.229 --> 01:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
fees you'd get some marginal increase in
 
01:59:42.350 --> 01:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
in state revenues but it would be a an
 
01:59:45.629 --> 01:59:45.639 align:start position:0%
added barrier to access to Justice which
 
01:59:47.470 --> 01:59:47.480 align:start position:0%
was the original point of the housing
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
appeals board so for those reasons um I
 
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
encourage you to ital this legislation
 
01:59:55.229 --> 01:59:55.239 align:start position:0%
but if you want to work on amendments
 
01:59:57.870 --> 01:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to assist with that as well
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you Mr
 
02:00:01.870 --> 02:00:01.880 align:start position:0%

hoc I I I do not have I I have some
 
02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:15.719 align:start position:0%
scribbled notes I can produce something
 
02:00:18.069 --> 02:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
if you wish representa I'd be happy to
 
02:00:20.149 --> 02:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
do that thank you
 
02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness seeing
 
02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much Mr Frost next
 
02:00:26.830 --> 02:00:26.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call on Aaron krian please
 
02:00:33.390 --> 02:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
branch hello again Representatives uh
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
very very briefly uh this question
 
02:00:41.149 --> 02:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
that's before you is is not one on which
 
02:00:42.750 --> 02:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch would appin but to
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
your other question which is whether
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
judges should be appointing quasi
 
02:00:49.149 --> 02:00:49.159 align:start position:0%
judicial authorities I can tell you that
 
02:00:50.830 --> 02:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
that is not something that these judges
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
feel is a core competency uh of theirs
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
particularly because in the statutes
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
where this appears that the supreme
 
02:00:59.350 --> 02:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
court appoints a person to a quasi
 
02:01:01.629 --> 02:01:01.639 align:start position:0%
judicial executive board typically it
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
also appears that there's a removal
 
02:01:05.069 --> 02:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
obligation which exists only for the
 
02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court uh which does not manage
 
02:01:10.030 --> 02:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh or have information about how those
 
02:01:12.910 --> 02:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
officers are performing uh but which the
 
02:01:14.910 --> 02:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
governor May and Council may have
 
02:01:17.790 --> 02:01:17.800 align:start position:0%
information about uh so it is it is a it
 
02:01:19.470 --> 02:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
is an interesting formulation it in a
 
02:01:22.069 --> 02:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
couple of statutes and it's it's a
 
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
little difficult to implement uh so to
 
02:01:26.750 --> 02:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
your question of whether different types
 
02:01:28.830 --> 02:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
of bills would be packaged that impact
 
02:01:31.669 --> 02:01:31.679 align:start position:0%
the btla and the hab and this this
 
02:01:33.069 --> 02:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
change in the appointment and removal
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
Authority is one that would probably
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
make a great deal of sense to commit
 
02:01:38.229 --> 02:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
that to a branch that has more
 
02:01:41.350 --> 02:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
competency in the area and more direct
 
02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
supervision the questions for uh this
 
02:01:47.310 --> 02:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
witness I I assume if I mean if we were
 
02:01:49.470 --> 02:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
going to do that I I I can only speak
 
02:01:51.189 --> 02:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
for myself but my inclination would be
 
02:01:52.589 --> 02:01:52.599 align:start position:0%
that if we were going to do something
 
02:01:54.910 --> 02:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
like that we would have to word the
 
02:01:58.189 --> 02:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
statute to say it would be prospective
 
02:02:01.270 --> 02:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
only so in other words any it doesn't
 
02:02:02.990 --> 02:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
affect anybody that's on either of those
 
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
boards now but any new appointment after
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
a certain date would go through governor
 
02:02:09.870 --> 02:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
and Council as opposed to as opposed to
 
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court right I I assume that
 
02:02:13.470 --> 02:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
that would be the soundest uh way to do
 
02:02:15.870 --> 02:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
it I don't know whether you would want
 
02:02:18.589 --> 02:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
removal of current members to also be by
 
02:02:20.350 --> 02:02:20.360 align:start position:0%
whoever their appointing authority was
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
or whether you would want to
 
02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
prospectively make sure that all
 
02:02:25.470 --> 02:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
removals are done by the same Authority
 
02:02:28.830 --> 02:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
sure good no very good point other any
 
02:02:30.669 --> 02:02:30.679 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness thank
 
02:02:35.629 --> 02:02:35.639 align:start position:0%

gtown Hillsboro District 29 I'm here

today um as the chair of another
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
committee that was put together by the
 
02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:19.430 align:start position:0%
committee that was put together by the
speaker

02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
02:03:21.790 --> 02:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
um to address the needs of New
 
02:03:23.629 --> 02:03:23.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's housing crisis um there's
 
02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
two members of this Judiciary Committee
 
02:03:26.430 --> 02:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
that also sered with me represented
 
02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:29.679 align:start position:0%
Wallace represent of D Lorenzo um and
 
02:03:31.229 --> 02:03:31.239 align:start position:0%
the past year if you weren't following
 
02:03:32.830 --> 02:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
along I hope everybody was but if you
 
02:03:35.310 --> 02:03:35.320 align:start position:0%
weren't um the past year we have been
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
sitting down with various stakeholders
 
02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the Housing Community um developers
 
02:03:43.470 --> 02:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
planners um State officials
 
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
um the whole Gambit um and we really
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to get down to the idea of what
 
02:03:51.549 --> 02:03:51.559 align:start position:0%
little changes can we make to help
 
02:03:54.030 --> 02:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
alleviate the housing crisis and one
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
thing that came up um was the fact that
 
02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
at times um state agencies or or
 
02:04:03.629 --> 02:04:03.639 align:start position:0%
building code review or different
 
02:04:05.709 --> 02:04:05.719 align:start position:0%
departments sometimes hold up the
 
02:04:07.830 --> 02:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
approval of a development over some
 
02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
small rule um
 
02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:12.030 align:start position:0%
small rule um
regulation

02:04:12.030 --> 02:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
that in my opinion if Common Sense
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
prevailed it would have it would have
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
been an okay change so um the the way
 
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
that this bill is written is to expand
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
the authority to a housing appeals board
 
02:04:28.589 --> 02:04:28.599 align:start position:0%
in only specific cases related to
 
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
residential um proposals when there is a
 
02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
state agency or state ruling that a
 
02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
private property owner disagrees with so
 
02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
um this would expedite the process allow
 
02:04:41.470 --> 02:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board um to oversee
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
these jurisdictions and as we heard from
 
02:04:44.750 --> 02:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
the last hearing I believe that they do
 
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
have the subject matter expertise um to
 
02:04:50.069 --> 02:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
expand this to this specific case uh
 
02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
that allows a ruling of the state agency
 
02:04:55.669 --> 02:04:55.679 align:start position:0%
so there there are many here to speak on
 
02:04:56.830 --> 02:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
why this would help the Housing
 
02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
Community um but I want to speak from
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
two developers that have written to me
 
02:05:06.270 --> 02:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
anonymously about this developer one
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
says even though there's an expedited
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
review path for the alteration of
 
02:05:12.910 --> 02:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
terrain permit on the books for Dees it
 
02:05:14.350 --> 02:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
still takes months and a lot of money
 
02:05:16.350 --> 02:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
and effort to obtain permits having to
 
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
involve fishing game for wildlife
 
02:05:20.310 --> 02:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
reviews by a wild life biologist adds
 
02:05:23.669 --> 02:05:23.679 align:start position:0%
time and cost to these developments as
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
well the same developer says that New
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do would better serve
 
02:05:29.790 --> 02:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
communities by not quote over
 
02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
engineering the process and being
 
02:05:33.189 --> 02:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
mindful of these facts that these
 
02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
developments don't have unlimited
 
02:05:37.149 --> 02:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
funding so in general this developer
 
02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
says in general Common Sense should
 
02:05:41.589 --> 02:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
Prevail but it rarely does so this gives
 
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
a faster path for somebody that has
 
02:05:47.790 --> 02:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
a has an issue with a ruling to go to
 
02:05:49.149 --> 02:05:49.159 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board can happen
 
02:05:52.510 --> 02:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
faster so um developer 2 one more the
 
02:05:54.270 --> 02:05:54.280 align:start position:0%
state agency that causes most delays
 
02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
with obtaining necessary permits for
 
02:05:58.229 --> 02:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
housing is Dees he cited fish and game
 
02:06:00.549 --> 02:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
is the most egregious Fish and Game must
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
sign off to obtain alteration of terrain
 
02:06:05.189 --> 02:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
and Wetland permits and according to
 
02:06:06.750 --> 02:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
developer they have no statutory time
 
02:06:08.549 --> 02:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
period to sign off and they've seen
 
02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
significant delays so if you want a
 
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
government and a state government that
 
02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
works more efficiently um I implore you
 
02:06:19.149 --> 02:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill so that we can
 
02:06:20.830 --> 02:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
allow common sense to Prevail in these
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
specific situations result um relating
 
02:06:25.950 --> 02:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
to residential housing so um with that
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm happy to take questions there's
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%

representing Epsom
 
02:07:47.669 --> 02:07:47.679 align:start position:0%
um I have the ultimate anecdote of why
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is is
 
02:07:53.709 --> 02:07:53.719 align:start position:0%
necessary um 10 years ago uh I happened
 
02:07:55.350 --> 02:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
to meet a constituent not that he came
 
02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
to me but I happened to meet him and we
 
02:07:59.950 --> 02:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
were discussing his situation from
 
02:08:04.669 --> 02:08:04.679 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield and this um uh was elderly
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
couple in their early 70s and they lived
 
02:08:11.310 --> 02:08:11.320 align:start position:0%
in an 1800's
 
02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
Farmhouse and um their land was such
 
02:08:18.549 --> 02:08:18.559 align:start position:0%
that the the house was like on one side
 
02:08:21.189 --> 02:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
side of the land and there was an empty
 
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
lot on the other side right or or extra
 
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
space and they had gone to their local
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
planning board and and split their land
 
02:08:34.109 --> 02:08:34.119 align:start position:0%
into two lots maybe six years previously
 
02:08:36.109 --> 02:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
or something like what the stuff I'm
 
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
talking about is 10 years old so maybe
 
02:08:40.549 --> 02:08:40.559 align:start position:0%
six years prior to that they had split
 
02:08:43.229 --> 02:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
the lot into two lots so they had an
 
02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
empty building lot and they had this
 
02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:46.910 align:start position:0%
empty building lot and they had this
1800s

02:08:46.910 --> 02:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
1800s
 
02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
Farmhouse and it they the the these lots
 
02:08:53.430 --> 02:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
are on Main Street in Pittsfield which
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
happen to be a state road you know it's
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
just houses where this was is just
 
02:09:01.470 --> 02:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
houses up and down the street but it's
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
an unnumbered State Road okay so
 
02:09:07.149 --> 02:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
therefore um they got to a point where
 
02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
they were tired of taking care of their
 
02:09:13.069 --> 02:09:13.079 align:start position:0%
1800 um Farmhouse right it was too much
 
02:09:15.069 --> 02:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
work they're in their 70s and they
 
02:09:18.589 --> 02:09:18.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to build a ranch style house in
 
02:09:21.310 --> 02:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
this neighboring lot and sell the the
 
02:09:23.629 --> 02:09:23.639 align:start position:0%
original house right because they they
 
02:09:25.589 --> 02:09:25.599 align:start position:0%
were getting old and they wanted less
 
02:09:30.189 --> 02:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
work right so uh it because this is a
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
state road they didn't go to their
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
planning board for a driveway permit
 
02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
they went to
 
02:09:40.069 --> 02:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
do all right and do refused them a
 
02:09:41.709 --> 02:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
permit for this
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
lot okay and and it's you know they they
 
02:09:47.870 --> 02:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
wanted a 40ft driveway I mean something
 
02:09:50.709 --> 02:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
tiny right it's houses up and down the
 
02:09:54.430 --> 02:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
street there's no sight distance issues
 
02:09:56.790 --> 02:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
and and so they asked do why can't I
 
02:10:00.990 --> 02:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
have a driveway permit and they said
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
well um your lot all we have a rule we
 
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
we don't give more than five driveway
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
permits per lot and and your lot already
 
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
has five so we can't give you another
 
02:10:14.549 --> 02:10:14.559 align:start position:0%
one and they said whatat are you talking
 
02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
about this is a an empty lot that has no
 
02:10:21.069 --> 02:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
driveway and do said well according to
 
02:10:24.030 --> 02:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
our rules we use the
 
02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:26.270 align:start position:0%
our rules we use the
1971

02:10:26.270 --> 02:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
1971
 
02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:30.599 align:start position:0%
map all right and in the 197 in
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
1971 your Farmhouse was on a farm okay
 
02:10:37.750 --> 02:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
and it hadn't yet been subdivided into
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
all the different houses that it was
 
02:10:43.069 --> 02:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
subdivided into all right and so now we
 
02:10:46.350 --> 02:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
we you know it there's so so we think of
 
02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
the 1971 map as defense ative and it has
 
02:10:52.069 --> 02:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
five driveways right one for this house
 
02:10:54.270 --> 02:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
one for that house and so on well you
 
02:10:56.709 --> 02:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
know this is plainly ridiculous all
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
right and and the problem is Do's rules
 
02:11:04.189 --> 02:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
are not subject to Jael car for one
 
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
thing they're exempt from Jael car and
 
02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
and so no legislator had ever looked at
 
02:11:13.310 --> 02:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
this 1971 rule it was just pregated by
 
02:11:17.790 --> 02:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
the department itself and and I got the
 
02:11:19.950 --> 02:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
chair the commissioner of dot to come
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
look at the situation they went through
 
02:11:24.310 --> 02:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
there is an appeal internal appeals
 
02:11:27.390 --> 02:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
process well but you appeal from do to
 
02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
do right and uh you know the appeals
 
02:11:33.549 --> 02:11:33.559 align:start position:0%
board only meets in the summer so you
 
02:11:35.350 --> 02:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
know six months here and six months
 
02:11:38.830 --> 02:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
there and so on and so you know we went
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
around and around and and they refused
 
02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
to budge and and um
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
eventually these guys got tired of this
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
this and moved to Florida right I mean
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
it it just messed with their lives and
 
02:11:56.950 --> 02:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
and I met the guy maybe four years after
 
02:11:58.669 --> 02:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
this happened and he said you wouldn't
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
believe it but dot mailed me my permit
 
02:12:05.109 --> 02:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
you know and and it was like but you
 
02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
know it was too late right because they
 
02:12:08.470 --> 02:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
because they you know they had moved to
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
Florida so it was like they were playing
 
02:12:13.629 --> 02:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
with them and then and then they just
 
02:12:16.510 --> 02:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
decided to you know it was no longer fun
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
for them and they gave them the permit
 
02:12:20.030 --> 02:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean it it was
 
02:12:23.390 --> 02:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
just it was just nutty and and
 
02:12:27.069 --> 02:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
so and so this bill would at least give
 
02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
them a simpler alternative place to go
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
right which would be the housing appeals
 
02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
boort and I think you know um
 
02:12:37.510 --> 02:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander used the word
 
02:12:39.589 --> 02:12:39.599 align:start position:0%
common sense right anybody looking at
 
02:12:41.910 --> 02:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
this particular situation would say you
 
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
know there's nothing to this anyway
 
02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%

02:13:58.520 --> 02:13:59.629 align:start position:0%
Hampshire commission for human rights
from

02:13:59.629 --> 02:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
1981 uh through
 
02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:04.510 align:start position:0%
1981 uh through
1987

02:14:04.510 --> 02:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
1987
 
02:14:08.709 --> 02:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
um I support this bill uh but I am here
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
to uh present the amendment that has
 
02:14:14.830 --> 02:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
just been passed out and to discuss the
 
02:14:17.950 --> 02:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
the need for the amendment um I did
 
02:14:19.750 --> 02:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
discuss this with the prime sponsor of
 
02:14:22.470 --> 02:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
the bill and I hope it will be regarded
 
02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
as a friendly
 
02:14:29.470 --> 02:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh the amendment is uh L on
 
02:14:32.990 --> 02:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
lines 11 through 14 on the paper that I
 
02:14:37.310 --> 02:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
just passed out it appears from 16 from
 
02:14:41.430 --> 02:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 16002 as drafted uh that
 
02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
since it covers appeals from state
 
02:14:47.149 --> 02:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
agency in regard to housing it would
 
02:14:49.030 --> 02:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
cover appe appealed from the New
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Human Rights Commission on
 
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
housing discrimination
 
02:14:57.149 --> 02:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
cases the amendment that I am proposing
 
02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
would exclude such appeals from the New
 
02:15:02.510 --> 02:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire commission for human rights
 
02:15:04.589 --> 02:15:04.599 align:start position:0%
from the jurisdiction of the housing
 
02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
appeals board the reason for this is
 
02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:09.030 align:start position:0%
appeals board the reason for this is
that

02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
02:15:15.069 --> 02:15:15.079 align:start position:0%
354a which established the Human Rights
 
02:15:19.470 --> 02:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
Commission and governs its procedures
 
02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
decisions of the Human Rights Commission
 
02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
and orders from the Human Rights
 
02:15:25.950 --> 02:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
Commission are appealable to Superior
 
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
Court and from there to uh the state
 
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
supreme court and I believe that the uh
 
02:15:35.709 --> 02:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
dual jurisdiction that would be created
 
02:15:38.350 --> 02:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
by this bill without the amendment would
 
02:15:40.830 --> 02:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
create problems uh this proposed
 
02:15:44.189 --> 02:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
amendment would um keep appealed from
 
02:15:46.589 --> 02:15:46.599 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission orders as
 
02:15:50.229 --> 02:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
they are currently under RSA
 
02:15:53.109 --> 02:15:53.119 align:start position:0%
354a I want to mention that I have
 
02:15:56.549 --> 02:15:56.559 align:start position:0%
reviewed uh quickly reviewed um the
 
02:16:00.470 --> 02:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
previous Bill uh House Bill 1651 it does
 
02:16:02.990 --> 02:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
not seem to cover appeals from State
 
02:16:06.149 --> 02:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
agencies but if it were expanded to
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
include appeals from State agencies or
 
02:16:11.950 --> 02:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
combined with uh House Bill
 
02:16:14.510 --> 02:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
1602 I believe it would be important to
 
02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
include a similar
 
02:16:16.719 --> 02:16:18.870 align:start position:0%
include a similar
Amendment

02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh also uh House Bill
 
02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
1651 would uh in situations where a an
 
02:16:28.510 --> 02:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
appeal could be made either to the
 
02:16:30.990 --> 02:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
combined tax and land appeals and
 
02:16:34.549 --> 02:16:34.559 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board uh or to the
 
02:16:37.870 --> 02:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
superior court that it would require the
 
02:16:41.309 --> 02:16:41.319 align:start position:0%
appellant to wave um the appeal to
 
02:16:41.319 --> 02:16:43.030 align:start position:0%
appellant to wave um the appeal to
Superior

02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
Superior
 
02:16:45.469 --> 02:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
Court again I believe that this would
 
02:16:49.709 --> 02:16:49.719 align:start position:0%
would create problems uh uh regarding
 
02:16:53.509 --> 02:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
the um provisions of RSA
 
02:16:56.509 --> 02:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
354a and the way appeals from the Human
 
02:16:59.309 --> 02:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission work the last point I
 
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to make is regarding uh what is
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
referred to as substantial equivalency
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
between the New Hampshire laws against
 
02:17:12.549 --> 02:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
discrimination as regards housing and
 
02:17:14.429 --> 02:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
the Department of Housing and Urban
 
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
Development Office of fair housing and
 
02:17:18.629 --> 02:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
equal opportuni
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh jurisdiction under the federal fair
 
02:17:25.349 --> 02:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
housing act a state agency whose law is
 
02:17:26.910 --> 02:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
considered to be substantially
 
02:17:30.349 --> 02:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
equivalent can receive funding from HUD
 
02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
for cases
 
02:17:35.589 --> 02:17:35.599 align:start position:0%
investigated by the state agency such as
 
02:17:38.429 --> 02:17:38.439 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Human Rights
 
02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
Commission uh this was true in the past
 
02:17:44.589 --> 02:17:44.599 align:start position:0%
before there was a change in the federal
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
law uh but once the uh uh change in the
 
02:17:51.389 --> 02:17:51.399 align:start position:0%
federal law went into effect and a short
 
02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
grandfathering per period ended New
 
02:17:56.669 --> 02:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was no longer considered New
 
02:17:59.150 --> 02:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's law was no longer considered
 
02:18:01.549 --> 02:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
to be substantially equivalent and that
 
02:18:04.030 --> 02:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
funded funding
 
02:18:08.910 --> 02:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
stopped uh I know that
 
02:18:12.230 --> 02:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
um this change in
 
02:18:15.030 --> 02:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction uh to provide for the
 
02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board might create some
 
02:18:19.750 --> 02:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
problems regarding the substantial
 
02:18:23.429 --> 02:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
equivalency issue I know that the Human
 
02:18:25.669 --> 02:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission uh the Commissioners
 
02:18:28.509 --> 02:18:28.519 align:start position:0%
and staff have worked very hard uh with
 
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office and the
 
02:18:35.429 --> 02:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
attorneys uh from HUD uh to bring New
 
02:18:37.830 --> 02:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's law into substantial
 
02:18:41.469 --> 02:18:41.479 align:start position:0%
equivalency and um it seems like a good
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
possibility that this would uh create
 
02:18:47.070 --> 02:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
problem that this bill uh would create
 
02:18:49.469 --> 02:18:49.479 align:start position:0%
problems without the
 
02:18:52.469 --> 02:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
amendment uh Anie Malachi director
 
02:18:54.709 --> 02:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
current director of the New Hampshire
 
02:18:57.469 --> 02:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission is here also and
 
02:19:00.469 --> 02:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
she can testify in more detail about the
 
02:19:03.750 --> 02:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
current um uh situation regarding
 
02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:05.030 align:start position:0%
current um uh situation regarding
substantial

02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
02:19:07.389 --> 02:19:07.399 align:start position:0%
equivalency and I'm open to any
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this witness Mr
 
02:19:13.230 --> 02:19:13.240 align:start position:0%

example of what type of
 
02:19:27.629 --> 02:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
um violation of RSA 354a would um be
 
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
incorporated into like Housing
 
02:19:35.709 --> 02:19:35.719 align:start position:0%
Development well um uh there are um
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
Provisions in RSA 354a regarding
 
02:19:42.589 --> 02:19:42.599 align:start position:0%
discrimination by developers uh and
 
02:19:46.950 --> 02:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
sellers of real estate um regarding uh
 
02:19:50.429 --> 02:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
race sex color religion national

disability uh and also
 
02:20:00.349 --> 02:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
um uh there is a um a need for um
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
accommodation in order to be uh
 
02:20:05.469 --> 02:20:05.479 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent with the
 
02:20:08.790 --> 02:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
federal law uh that is uh accommodation
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
in the physical development of the
 
02:20:16.190 --> 02:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
housing uh and if um there were to be a
 
02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
change in the way way that the appeals
 
02:20:23.469 --> 02:20:23.479 align:start position:0%
are structured again this might cause a
 
02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
problem thank you may I follow up yes
 
02:20:30.030 --> 02:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
please so for example um let's say that
 
02:20:33.910 --> 02:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh a developer is building a mixed
 
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
income Community with
 
02:20:40.910 --> 02:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
um some accessible units and then with a
 
02:20:44.830 --> 02:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
um sort of like a um tenant selection
 
02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
plan or res selection oops excuse me I'm
 
02:20:50.990 --> 02:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
I'm very sorry um could you speak into
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
the microphone I can't hear you sure
 
02:20:56.230 --> 02:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you uh is that better yes thank
 
02:20:59.389 --> 02:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
you great so um I'm trying to Envision
 
02:21:01.309 --> 02:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
this and let's say that we have a
 
02:21:03.670 --> 02:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
developer the developers um mixed income
 
02:21:07.830 --> 02:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
housing and then they have a um a plan a
 
02:21:12.990 --> 02:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:19.309 --> 02:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:22.510 --> 02:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
residents identified as
 
02:21:26.429 --> 02:21:26.439 align:start position:0%
minorities excuse me identified as
 
02:21:29.309 --> 02:21:29.319 align:start position:0%
minorities okay okay so how would would
 
02:21:32.830 --> 02:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
that be an example like if the town or
 
02:21:36.590 --> 02:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
well if if there were some activity um
 
02:21:38.710 --> 02:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh that either directly excluded
 
02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
minorities or in by its effect excluded
 
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
minorities that would be an issue where
 
02:21:46.510 --> 02:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
a complaint could be filed with the
 
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
human rights Comm commission and uh if
 
02:21:52.030 --> 02:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
probable calls were found and there was
 
02:21:54.790 --> 02:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
no settlement uh it could come for a
 
02:21:56.910 --> 02:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
hearing at the Human Rights Commission
 
02:21:58.670 --> 02:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
and if discrimination were found and
 
02:22:03.630 --> 02:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:07.070 --> 02:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
you other questions so let me just ask
 
02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
you would um I I sort of um I think I
 
02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
share the same uh question or concerns
 
02:22:17.950 --> 02:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
that representative D Lorenzo had if we
 
02:22:21.389 --> 02:22:21.399 align:start position:0%
if we were to change the language of the
 
02:22:25.469 --> 02:22:25.479 align:start position:0%
bill 16002 to
 
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
say um final decision of a state
 
02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
agency uh having authority
 
02:22:35.670 --> 02:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
regulate land use in some fashion or I'm
 
02:22:42.550 --> 02:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
not sure of the exact language but would
 
02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
that be enough to sort of make it clear
 
02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
that youan I I I I I don't I don't think
 
02:22:50.590 --> 02:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
so because um again I discussed this
 
02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
with the prime sponsor and we discussed
 
02:22:57.349 --> 02:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
the possibility of whether um actions by
 
02:22:58.990 --> 02:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission would be
 
02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
covered by this bill and agreed that
 
02:23:02.990 --> 02:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
there was a good likelihood that they
 
02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
would be covered so there's a whole
 
02:23:08.510 --> 02:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
variety uh which are not directly land
 
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
use but which are other types of uh
 
02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
housing related actions that could be
 
02:23:17.349 --> 02:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
covered by this bill and I think think
 
02:23:20.349 --> 02:23:20.359 align:start position:0%
it's very important to make it clear
 
02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
that we are excluding orders from the
 
02:23:25.990 --> 02:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission and that's why I
 
02:23:28.830 --> 02:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
phrased the amendment uh starting on
 
02:23:31.550 --> 02:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
line 11 uh of the of the sheet I passed
 
02:23:33.389 --> 02:23:33.399 align:start position:0%
out that's why I phrased it the way I
 
02:23:35.990 --> 02:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
did okay all right other questions for
 
02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:36.750 align:start position:0%
did okay all right other questions for
this

02:23:36.750 --> 02:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:23:40.389 --> 02:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:57.389 align:start position:0%
 
please

02:23:57.389 --> 02:23:57.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:59.710 --> 02:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
good morning uh thank you uh chairman
 
02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
Lynn thank you committee members for
 
02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
taking my comments uh my name is Edward
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
Rogers um since uh 2021 I've served as a
 
02:24:11.309 --> 02:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
member of the housing appeals board um
 
02:24:13.389 --> 02:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
just wanted to take uh this opportunity
 
02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
to share with you uh some of our
 
02:24:17.590 --> 02:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts and concerns and and some uh
 
02:24:20.230 --> 02:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
some information about the board uh with
 
02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
respect to this uh this proposed bill um
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
since the hab uh began hearing cases in
 
02:24:31.349 --> 02:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
2021 we've been very proud excuse
 
02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
me uh very proud to offer an opportunity
 
02:24:36.830 --> 02:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
for appeals that uh may have been
 
02:24:40.150 --> 02:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
inaccessible or impractical before for
 
02:24:43.150 --> 02:24:43.160 align:start position:0%
for certain applicants uh since that
 
02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
time we've been proud to provide
 
02:24:47.510 --> 02:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
applicants with
 
02:24:50.230 --> 02:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts to hear their
 
02:24:54.030 --> 02:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
cases um we've been proud to provide a a
 
02:24:57.710 --> 02:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable and accessible Avenue for
 
02:25:01.190 --> 02:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
prosay applicants to be heard and to
 
02:25:04.630 --> 02:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
provide quick turnaround times so that
 
02:25:07.190 --> 02:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
applicants can move on to the next
 
02:25:09.870 --> 02:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
stages of their projects whether that
 
02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
means active development or whether that
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
means redesign and back to the drawing
 
02:25:16.399 --> 02:25:17.910 align:start position:0%
means redesign and back to the drawing
board

02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:25:20.110 --> 02:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
um I think the housing appeals board has
 
02:25:23.150 --> 02:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
proven that the intent of the
 
02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
legislature back in July of 2020 could
 
02:25:28.030 --> 02:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
be carried out
 
02:25:31.190 --> 02:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
effectively the hab has distinguished
 
02:25:34.469 --> 02:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
itself as the clear root for receiving
 
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
an expedited adjudication that
 
02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:41.269 align:start position:0%
an expedited adjudication that
requires

02:25:41.269 --> 02:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
requires
 
02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
specialization the distinctive
 
02:25:45.309 --> 02:25:45.319 align:start position:0%
capability of experts in land use
 
02:25:49.269 --> 02:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
appeals matters um the hab has followed
 
02:25:53.710 --> 02:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
the proposal of House Bill 162 and sees
 
02:25:57.110 --> 02:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
how its intent could also be effectively
 
02:26:00.349 --> 02:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
carried out within the Habs means and
 
02:26:00.359 --> 02:26:01.389 align:start position:0%
carried out within the Habs means and
current

02:26:01.389 --> 02:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:26:04.190 --> 02:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
framework um I would note that the
 
02:26:07.429 --> 02:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
proposed expansion of authority uh
 
02:26:08.710 --> 02:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
that's being proposed here for the
 
02:26:13.070 --> 02:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board will likely result
 
02:26:17.550 --> 02:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
in an increase uh in its case load um
 
02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
however I do feel that we have the
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
capacity to handle this increased volume
 
02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say exactly what that would
 
02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
look like but we do feel like we most
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
likely would be able to handle it um
 
02:26:32.510 --> 02:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
those are the only observations I have
 
02:26:34.510 --> 02:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
to offer on the proposal at this time
 
02:26:36.230 --> 02:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
and I'd be glad to take any
 
02:26:41.030 --> 02:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
questions questions uh for this
 
02:26:43.790 --> 02:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
witness oh I'm sorry represent CH just
 
02:26:46.469 --> 02:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
in general do do you have a position oo
 
02:26:49.830 --> 02:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
oppos are supportive of it uh we support
 
02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:51.469 align:start position:0%
oppos are supportive of it uh we support
the

02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:26:54.510 --> 02:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
bill other question so you know can I
 
02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
ask you a question that comes to mind in
 
02:26:58.630 --> 02:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
light of the testimony of the last
 
02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
witness certainly as I I mean it sounds
 
02:27:04.750 --> 02:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
like from from both the sponsors
 
02:27:06.630 --> 02:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
testimony and and what everybody else
 
02:27:10.910 --> 02:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
has said that one of the things that um
 
02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow if
 
02:27:16.790 --> 02:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
the um if we were to pass it uh wither
 
02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
without the amendment uh proposed by the
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
prior witness would be that the housing
 
02:27:25.630 --> 02:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
appeals board would hear and decide
 
02:27:27.349 --> 02:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
appeals from the Department of
 
02:27:29.870 --> 02:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services if they related
 
02:27:33.870 --> 02:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
to a Housing Development is that
 
02:27:36.910 --> 02:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
correct d yes yes right and so I guess
 
02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:37.950 align:start position:0%
correct d yes yes right and so I guess
what

02:27:37.950 --> 02:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:41.150 align:start position:0%
what
I'm

02:27:41.150 --> 02:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:44.670 --> 02:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
my to be honest with you this is this is
 
02:27:47.790 --> 02:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
in some sense a political question but I
 
02:27:50.429 --> 02:27:50.439 align:start position:0%
think it's an important one as I
 
02:27:52.349 --> 02:27:52.359 align:start position:0%
understand the way the appeals process
 
02:27:56.710 --> 02:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
from Dees currently works is that they
 
02:27:59.070 --> 02:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
make if somebody at Dees makes a final
 
02:28:01.429 --> 02:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
decision the commissioner or whatever it
 
02:28:05.150 --> 02:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
then goes to either depending on the
 
02:28:08.269 --> 02:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
kind if it's if it involves water or air
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
or um uh uh uh ground groundwater
 
02:28:15.630 --> 02:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
pollution or something like that it goes
 
02:28:19.150 --> 02:28:19.160 align:start position:0%
to the uh the council the council that
 
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
deals with that particular kind of of uh
 
02:28:26.110 --> 02:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
matter who is composed
 
02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
of a significant number of individuals
 
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
who are appointed to serve on those
 
02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:34.550 align:start position:0%
who are appointed to serve on those
councils

02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
councils
 
02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
and because of my involvement in another
 
02:28:40.830 --> 02:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
bill that deals with that dealed with
 
02:28:43.269 --> 02:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
dealt with proposes to deal with
 
02:28:46.269 --> 02:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
changing the appeals uh appeals process
 
02:28:49.469 --> 02:28:49.479 align:start position:0%
and environmental cases my understanding
 
02:28:52.030 --> 02:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
is that there that those those
 
02:28:54.150 --> 02:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
counselors I mean those people that are
 
02:28:56.429 --> 02:28:56.439 align:start position:0%
appointed that to those councils are
 
02:29:01.030 --> 02:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
very very invested in remaining as
 
02:29:03.030 --> 02:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
members of the think it very strongly
 
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
that those councils should continue to
 
02:29:07.630 --> 02:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
exist so I guess my question is have you
 
02:29:10.110 --> 02:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
given any thought
 
02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
to um what kind of a firestorm this may
 
02:29:17.510 --> 02:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
create if we were to uh if we were to
 
02:29:20.230 --> 02:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
replace those councils with just the
 
02:29:22.070 --> 02:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
housing appeals
 
02:29:24.190 --> 02:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
board I'm afraid I'm gonna have to leave
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
it to the committee to uh decide which
 
02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
process is best uh I'm not here to
 
02:29:32.830 --> 02:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
comment on that
 
02:29:38.469 --> 02:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
today uh I would only suggest that
 
02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
um this is this is a bill that if
 
02:29:46.670 --> 02:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
approved would affect us and uh we feel
 
02:29:49.630 --> 02:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
like we could manage the additional
 
02:29:52.349 --> 02:29:52.359 align:start position:0%
Authority um and we would support it in
 
02:29:55.630 --> 02:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
its current form without uh without
 
02:29:58.030 --> 02:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
suggesting anything uh positive or
 
02:30:00.429 --> 02:30:00.439 align:start position:0%
negative about about the current process
 
02:30:02.030 --> 02:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
all right all right thank you uh
 
02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr chair
 
02:30:07.070 --> 02:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
this is a question for
 
02:30:10.030 --> 02:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
you did I
 
02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
misunderstand either the bill or you so
 
02:30:15.510 --> 02:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
tell me where I'm wrong CU clearly I've
 
02:30:17.110 --> 02:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
misunderstood something
 
02:30:20.790 --> 02:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
I thought that the
 
02:30:23.950 --> 02:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
ability um
 
02:30:28.990 --> 02:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
to protest a decision of a state
 
02:30:35.230 --> 02:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
agency um before the board is uh limited
 
02:30:38.110 --> 02:30:38.120 align:start position:0%
to those people who are questioning the
 
02:30:41.389 --> 02:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
decision of the state agency I don't see
 
02:30:45.070 --> 02:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
that the state agency would have the
 
02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
right to
 
02:30:50.670 --> 02:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
appeal oh no well no you I no I think
 
02:30:53.230 --> 02:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
you may I I'm not I was that was not the
 
02:30:55.349 --> 02:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
point that I was getting though yeah I
 
02:30:56.790 --> 02:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
don't I think you're probably right on
 
02:31:00.150 --> 02:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
that but my my point was I think under
 
02:31:04.790 --> 02:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
the current system if somebody is
 
02:31:07.230 --> 02:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
unhappy with some a decision of
 
02:31:11.469 --> 02:31:11.479 align:start position:0%
Dees they have to go to the to the for
 
02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
example the wetlands count for example
 
02:31:15.190 --> 02:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
let's say that there let's say that the
 
02:31:17.309 --> 02:31:17.319 align:start position:0%
um Dees says there's a proposal for
 
02:31:19.190 --> 02:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
Housing Development and Dees says no
 
02:31:21.230 --> 02:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
this is Wetlands you can't you can't
 
02:31:24.349 --> 02:31:24.359 align:start position:0%
build there um my understanding is that
 
02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
the the the person who's unhappy with
 
02:31:30.070 --> 02:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
that would have to go to the I think
 
02:31:32.429 --> 02:31:32.439 align:start position:0%
it's called the wetlands Council which
 
02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
consists of you know a whole bunch of
 
02:31:37.790 --> 02:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
people who would make the decision and
 
02:31:39.110 --> 02:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
then that could be appealed to the
 
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and my only concern
 
02:31:46.429 --> 02:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
was as I said my understanding
 
02:31:49.230 --> 02:31:49.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there's there is a
 
02:31:52.590 --> 02:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
very strong for lack of a better term
 
02:31:55.790 --> 02:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
Lobby that thinks that those that
 
02:31:58.429 --> 02:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
process is you know is fine and dandy
 
02:32:00.389 --> 02:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm not I don't I don't express any
 
02:32:03.349 --> 02:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
opinion on that but um that that I was
 
02:32:06.910 --> 02:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
really asking you if you know if that if
 
02:32:09.150 --> 02:32:09.160 align:start position:0%
if you had had any discussion or if
 
02:32:10.950 --> 02:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
you're people who support the bill had
 
02:32:14.510 --> 02:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
had any discussion with with the people
 
02:32:16.950 --> 02:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
who have who support that Lobby because
 
02:32:20.830 --> 02:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
my impression is that that would be you
 
02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
know that that would be quite a quite a
 
02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
fight over what what was the right
 
02:32:29.030 --> 02:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
answer we haven't had any any of those
 
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
discussions uh with anyone and I I would
 
02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh I would leave it to the committee to
 
02:32:35.950 --> 02:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh to explore that further no I
 
02:32:37.269 --> 02:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate that all right other
 
02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness seeing none
 
02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you Ben thank you Ben
 
02:32:43.120 --> 02:32:45.230 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you Ben thank you Ben
Frost

02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
Frost
 
02:32:45.240 --> 02:32:53.269 align:start position:0%
Frost
please

02:32:53.269 --> 02:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:55.429 --> 02:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and hello again
 
02:32:57.830 --> 02:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
Ben Frost I'm the deputy director and
 
02:32:59.389 --> 02:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
chief legal officer at New Hampshire
 
02:33:02.190 --> 02:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
housing um speaking in favor of House
 
02:33:04.269 --> 02:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
Bill 1602 I'll be very brief I know
 
02:33:08.950 --> 02:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
you're way behind time um I acknowledge
 
02:33:11.110 --> 02:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment profer by representative
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
Gibbs uh no objection to that I
 
02:33:15.590 --> 02:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
understand there is a particular process
 
02:33:17.550 --> 02:33:17.560 align:start position:0%
that's followed there I think you're
 
02:33:21.750 --> 02:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
likely also to hear uh testimony uh that
 
02:33:24.950 --> 02:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
expresses concerns from similar uh
 
02:33:28.910 --> 02:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
similarly situated uh others with with a
 
02:33:31.469 --> 02:33:31.479 align:start position:0%
similar pellet structure and I think
 
02:33:33.710 --> 02:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
there may be opportunity to find uh
 
02:33:36.309 --> 02:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate amendments uh to this this
 
02:33:38.750 --> 02:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
bill that would accommodate those those
 
02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
processes uh Mr chairman with regard to
 
02:33:43.269 --> 02:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
the the wetlands Council and the water
 
02:33:44.469 --> 02:33:44.479 align:start position:0%
Council and I think it's the air
 
02:33:47.990 --> 02:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
Resources Council at the yes um I I
 
02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
think there may be also opportunity
 
02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
there to find appropriate um uh
 
02:33:54.750 --> 02:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to accommodate those interests
 
02:33:56.990 --> 02:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
although I appreciate your political
 
02:34:00.469 --> 02:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
sensitivities on that point um I'll note
 
02:34:03.389 --> 02:34:03.399 align:start position:0%
that this legislation is really geared
 
02:34:07.110 --> 02:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
toward um the the sort of story that you
 
02:34:10.469 --> 02:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
heard from representative Maguire uh and
 
02:34:14.750 --> 02:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
to impart necessary efficiencies in
 
02:34:17.750 --> 02:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
process uh that that are sometimes
 
02:34:22.230 --> 02:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
lacking in our state agencies um I make
 
02:34:24.269 --> 02:34:24.279 align:start position:0%
no characterization about the hard work
 
02:34:26.030 --> 02:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
that state employees do uh they are
 
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
serving us all and admirably well but
 
02:34:31.710 --> 02:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes things don't go the way they
 
02:34:33.150 --> 02:34:33.160 align:start position:0%
should and there should be an
 
02:34:36.790 --> 02:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people to have access to
 
02:34:39.870 --> 02:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
some appeals mechanism uh that will deal
 
02:34:43.110 --> 02:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
with their uh concern appropriately uh
 
02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
and expeditiously and the housing
 
02:34:47.389 --> 02:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
appeals board does that that uh with the
 
02:34:50.550 --> 02:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
work that it does um I'll note um Alyssa
 
02:34:52.469 --> 02:34:52.479 align:start position:0%
marglin had also signed in to testify
 
02:34:53.790 --> 02:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
she had to leave for another meeting I
 
02:34:56.469 --> 02:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
do have written testimony from her that
 
02:34:58.030 --> 02:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
I will distribute to the committee that
 
02:34:59.429 --> 02:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
would be great thank you I'll be happy
 
02:35:01.349 --> 02:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
to take any questions if there are any
 
02:35:03.910 --> 02:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness seeing none
 
02:35:06.110 --> 02:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much next I'm going to
 
02:35:14.990 --> 02:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:16.790 align:start position:0%
 
please

02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:35:18.630 --> 02:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh members of the committee
 
02:35:20.309 --> 02:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
I'll be respective of your time and not
 
02:35:23.550 --> 02:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
repeat my comments from uh HB
 
02:35:26.429 --> 02:35:26.439 align:start position:0%
1651 uh but the conclusion still stands
 
02:35:28.790 --> 02:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
I hope that there's a way to exempt uh
 
02:35:31.269 --> 02:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
building and fire code issues from this
 
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
procedure that being said I don't think
 
02:35:37.269 --> 02:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
we would particularly be averse if uh
 
02:35:41.230 --> 02:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
this board was the appeal from our board
 
02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh currently the appeal is to the
 
02:35:44.870 --> 02:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
superior court and if on housing issues
 
02:35:46.710 --> 02:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
it went to this board I I don't think
 
02:35:49.070 --> 02:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
that would be a problem for us I'll
 
02:35:52.190 --> 02:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
leave it at that questions for this
 
02:35:56.830 --> 02:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:01.550 --> 02:36:01.560 align:start position:0%

02:36:40.750 --> 02:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
please uh good morning Mr chair and
 
02:36:44.150 --> 02:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um so
 
02:36:46.950 --> 02:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs uh I'm Anie Malachi
 
02:36:48.830 --> 02:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
from the Human Rights Commission um
 
02:36:51.309 --> 02:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs spoke eloquently
 
02:36:53.990 --> 02:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
about the concerns relative to the
 
02:36:56.190 --> 02:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
commission and the commission's process
 
02:36:58.950 --> 02:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
the only thing I would add to that is uh
 
02:37:02.710 --> 02:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
I believe in 2000 is when the commission
 
02:37:05.830 --> 02:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
lost the HUD contract because the
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
commission well because the laws against
 
02:37:10.630 --> 02:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
discrimination relative to housing were
 
02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
not uh in sync they were not
 
02:37:14.950 --> 02:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent with the
 
02:37:17.630 --> 02:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
federal housing act um and there have
 
02:37:19.710 --> 02:37:19.720 align:start position:0%
been several attempts over the course of
 
02:37:23.309 --> 02:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
the last we'll say 21 years um to make
 
02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
those changes and that did not happen in
 
02:37:30.550 --> 02:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
2021 um excuse me with consensus of
 
02:37:32.670 --> 02:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
quite a few stakeholders the uh
 
02:37:36.349 --> 02:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
legislation was adopted and part of the
 
02:37:39.030 --> 02:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
statute now and currently we are working
 
02:37:41.790 --> 02:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
with HUD to move forward in the process
 
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
regarding a HUD contract so if there are
 
02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
any questions specific to that questions
 
02:37:50.110 --> 02:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
for this
 
02:37:52.870 --> 02:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
02:37:55.030 --> 02:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you oh you know what I did forget
 
02:37:57.590 --> 02:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
to say that I of course with what
 
02:38:00.190 --> 02:38:00.200 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs said that if the
 
02:38:02.870 --> 02:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
amendment is not accepted in terms of
 
02:38:06.110 --> 02:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
carving out the commission then we would
 
02:38:08.750 --> 02:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
not be in substantial equivalency and we
 
02:38:10.630 --> 02:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
would not be able to continue forward
 
02:38:11.830 --> 02:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
with a HUD
 
02:38:14.389 --> 02:38:14.399 align:start position:0%

02:38:50.349 --> 02:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
less expensive option for property
 
02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
owners to appeal decisions from local
 
02:38:54.990 --> 02:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
Municipal boards property owners have
 
02:38:57.190 --> 02:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
always had the right to appeal to the
 
02:39:01.230 --> 02:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
superior court but that's often a slow
 
02:39:03.750 --> 02:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
and uous process the housing and Fields
 
02:39:06.389 --> 02:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
board has been a great success decisions
 
02:39:08.309 --> 02:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
come quicker for both the property
 
02:39:10.349 --> 02:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
owners and the
 
02:39:12.990 --> 02:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
municipality just like in Superior
 
02:39:14.790 --> 02:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
Courts sometimes the property owners
 
02:39:17.190 --> 02:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
Prevail and some times the town prevails
 
02:39:19.590 --> 02:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
however it saves everyone involved a lot
 
02:39:21.950 --> 02:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
of time and money it is entirely
 
02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate that the property owner's
 
02:39:25.950 --> 02:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
ability to appeal decisions of state
 
02:39:28.190 --> 02:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
agencies when those decisions impact
 
02:39:29.910 --> 02:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
housing and housing
 
02:39:33.790 --> 02:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
developments go to the
 
02:39:37.670 --> 02:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
habb uh House Bill 1602 protects private
 
02:39:39.510 --> 02:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
property rights of all New Hampshire
 
02:39:41.950 --> 02:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
residents by ensuring faster and less
 
02:39:44.230 --> 02:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
expensive option for appeals from
 
02:39:47.670 --> 02:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
government decisions some some agencies
 
02:39:50.550 --> 02:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
may have concerns about their time and
 
02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
expense of appearing at the hab first
 
02:39:57.070 --> 02:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
they will find it easier and less time
 
02:39:59.429 --> 02:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
consuming second we believe the time and
 
02:40:01.590 --> 02:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
expense of New Hampshire Property Owners
 
02:40:05.550 --> 02:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
should take precedence HB 1602 is not
 
02:40:07.590 --> 02:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
asking for laws or regulations governing
 
02:40:10.190 --> 02:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
land use to be changed if agencies
 
02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
adhere to those existing laws and
 
02:40:15.670 --> 02:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
regulations which they mostly do then
 
02:40:18.150 --> 02:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
there's no reason not to welcome appeals
 
02:40:21.429 --> 02:40:21.439 align:start position:0%
to the to the hab please support
 
02:40:24.670 --> 02:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
hp62 questions for this
 
02:40:28.590 --> 02:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you thank
 
02:40:31.790 --> 02:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
you uh I don't have any other cards is
 
02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who wishes to testify
 
02:40:36.750 --> 02:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
02:40:40.510 --> 02:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
16002 um I I see none before I close the
 
02:40:42.790 --> 02:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill however I I wonder
 
02:40:45.070 --> 02:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
if I could just ask and particularly I
 
02:40:47.469 --> 02:40:47.479 align:start position:0%
guess I would address direct this to uh
 
02:40:49.349 --> 02:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
Mr Frost but maybe anyone else in the
 
02:40:52.230 --> 02:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
room who has some expertise in this area
 
02:40:54.510 --> 02:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
as I'm hearing the testimony here I'm
 
02:40:58.670 --> 02:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that just as uh Miss
 
02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
Malachi and and the and and the
 
02:41:03.389 --> 02:41:03.399 align:start position:0%
representative from conquered pointed
 
02:41:06.670 --> 02:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
out you know I if if if they hadn't
 
02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
raised this issue it certainly wouldn't
 
02:41:11.790 --> 02:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
have occurred to me that there that we
 
02:41:15.830 --> 02:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
needed to uh make a carve out for the
 
02:41:18.389 --> 02:41:18.399 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission um and I think
 
02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
Mr Frost you indicated that there might
 
02:41:21.950 --> 02:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
be when I raised the issue of the
 
02:41:23.670 --> 02:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services you
 
02:41:26.070 --> 02:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
ra you indicated that maybe we need to
 
02:41:26.990 --> 02:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
do some
 
02:41:29.990 --> 02:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
tinkering uh so we you know we carve out
 
02:41:32.630 --> 02:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
that or make some changes and what I'm
 
02:41:35.110 --> 02:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
really worried about is it strikes me
 
02:41:38.190 --> 02:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
that I am generally personally very much
 
02:41:40.190 --> 02:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
in favor of this be of this bill because
 
02:41:42.750 --> 02:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
I think for as representative Alexander
 
02:41:45.830 --> 02:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
suggested would have the ability to to
 
02:41:48.910 --> 02:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
really speed along the process but I'm
 
02:41:51.630 --> 02:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
concerned of potential unintended
 
02:41:53.429 --> 02:41:53.439 align:start position:0%
consequences here that there may be
 
02:41:56.469 --> 02:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
other agencies other appeals uh
 
02:41:59.469 --> 02:41:59.479 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that we would be interfering
 
02:42:02.870 --> 02:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
with by by saying you know if you don't
 
02:42:04.150 --> 02:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
you don't have to go to the wetlands
 
02:42:05.510 --> 02:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
Council anymore for these kind of
 
02:42:06.590 --> 02:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
appeals you don't have to go to the
 
02:42:08.349 --> 02:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation anymore for
 
02:42:11.070 --> 02:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
these kind of appeals I don't know maybe
 
02:42:13.269 --> 02:42:13.279 align:start position:0%
maybe there somehow there's a labor you
 
02:42:15.469 --> 02:42:15.479 align:start position:0%
know some development could have some
 
02:42:17.110 --> 02:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
labor implications and you don't have to
 
02:42:19.750 --> 02:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
go to the labor department anymore um
 
02:42:21.670 --> 02:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
I'm worried about that and so I'm what
 
02:42:26.110 --> 02:42:26.120 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering is um if some people that
 
02:42:28.670 --> 02:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
are interested in this area might really
 
02:42:31.630 --> 02:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
take a look at uh and maybe provide us
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
some feedback if you could before we
 
02:42:35.309 --> 02:42:35.319 align:start position:0%
exec this which won't you know it won't
 
02:42:39.910 --> 02:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
be for a little while um on exactly what
 
02:42:42.670 --> 02:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
other what other appeals processes are
 
02:42:44.429 --> 02:42:44.439 align:start position:0%
out there that could be affected by this
 
02:42:45.870 --> 02:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
that we either
 
02:42:48.790 --> 02:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
deliberately want to change or we're you
 
02:42:50.670 --> 02:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
know we want to deliberately accept
 
02:42:53.309 --> 02:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
because of concerns exactly the same as
 
02:42:55.070 --> 02:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
we had with the Human Rights Commission
 
02:42:57.910 --> 02:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
so with that I will close the hearing
 
02:43:03.349 --> 02:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
and thank you um next I'm going to uh
 
02:43:07.269 --> 02:43:07.279 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on House Bill
 
02:43:11.230 --> 02:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
1707 and as I understand it we may have
 
02:43:14.269 --> 02:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
some sure
 
02:43:14.279 --> 02:43:16.790 align:start position:0%
some sure
hey

02:43:16.790 --> 02:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
hey
 
02:43:18.429 --> 02:43:18.439 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman ly and honorable
 
02:43:20.630 --> 02:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Nancy
 
02:43:22.910 --> 02:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
Murphy here uh representing the town of
 
02:43:26.110 --> 02:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
marac Hillsboro District 12 a community
 
02:43:27.469 --> 02:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
well known to be negatively and
 
02:43:30.309 --> 02:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
significantly impacted by pest toxic
 
02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
chemicals um that including one of which
 
02:43:36.550 --> 02:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
has been known to cause cancer HB 1707
 
02:43:38.150 --> 02:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
was written to address challenges and
 
02:43:39.750 --> 02:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
access to pest blood testing for
 
02:43:42.630 --> 02:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
Citizens living in past contaminated
 
02:43:45.269 --> 02:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
communities um rather than take the time
 
02:43:47.269 --> 02:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
to elaborate on the merits of this bill
 
02:43:50.550 --> 02:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
I request that this bill be ited I do so
 
02:43:52.950 --> 02:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
not because there isn't a problem and we
 
02:43:55.510 --> 02:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
need to hold polluters accountable but
 
02:43:57.630 --> 02:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
because emerging science and litigation
 
02:43:59.670 --> 02:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
is ongoing and I believe we should just
 
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
let that process play out uh with that
 
02:44:04.309 --> 02:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
I'll end my testimony and ask that the
 
02:44:06.389 --> 02:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
committee Grant my request thank you
 
02:44:09.389 --> 02:44:09.399 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for this witness
 
02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you um I wonder if um
 
02:44:16.150 --> 02:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
in light of that of the requ
 
02:44:18.309 --> 02:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry yes so any other anyone
 
02:44:21.230 --> 02:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
else who wishes to testify on House Bill
 
02:44:23.750 --> 02:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
1707 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
02:44:25.670 --> 02:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on that bill and before we
 
02:44:29.150 --> 02:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
recess for lunch um it's in light of the
 
02:44:31.710 --> 02:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
request to remove to itl the bill from
 
02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
the sponsor um I I wonder if uh ex if we
 
02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
can open an executive session and I then
 
02:44:42.429 --> 02:44:42.439 align:start position:0%
wonder if uh the ranking I I would
 
02:44:44.990 --> 02:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
certainly be amenable to executing the
 
02:44:47.670 --> 02:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
bill bill right now and granting the itl
 
02:44:49.630 --> 02:44:49.640 align:start position:0%
motion and I wonder if the exe if the
 
02:44:52.630 --> 02:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
ranking member would agree I too am
 
02:44:56.830 --> 02:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
supportive of that all right um yes just
 
02:44:58.750 --> 02:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
a procedural question since we did not
 
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
notice this for executive committee the
 
02:45:04.349 --> 02:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
24 hours notice and the public notice I
 
02:45:05.590 --> 02:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
understand we have your blessing does
 
02:45:06.830 --> 02:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
that give us enough authority to move
 
02:45:10.550 --> 02:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
forward the one of the um the changes
 
02:45:12.630 --> 02:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the changes that we
 
02:45:15.190 --> 02:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
have adopted in terms of house rules is
 
02:45:17.910 --> 02:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
if in fact there is a situation in which
 
02:45:22.670 --> 02:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
the chair and the ranking member
 
02:45:27.670 --> 02:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
agree we can call an executive session
 
02:45:29.870 --> 02:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
at the on the same day as we've heard
 
02:45:33.110 --> 02:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
the bill and vote on it and it is with
 
02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:34.990 align:start position:0%
the bill and vote on it and it is with
that

02:45:34.990 --> 02:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:39.429 --> 02:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
uh Cil I guess I would say that it is
 
02:45:41.269 --> 02:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
perfectly appropriate under our rules
 
02:45:44.830 --> 02:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
for us to do that and can I just ask uh
 
02:45:47.309 --> 02:45:47.319 align:start position:0%
be you know I I I obviously don't want
 
02:45:49.469 --> 02:45:49.479 align:start position:0%
to I want to make sure we've we've taken
 
02:45:52.429 --> 02:45:52.439 align:start position:0%
into consideration whatever any contrary
 
02:45:53.630 --> 02:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
views that any members of the committee
 
02:45:55.830 --> 02:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
may have anybody have a problem with us
 
02:46:01.349 --> 02:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
executing this right now all right so
 
02:46:06.429 --> 02:46:06.439 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair I would make a motion of
 
02:46:06.439 --> 02:46:08.550 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair I would make a motion of
itl

02:46:08.550 --> 02:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
itl
 
02:46:10.429 --> 02:46:10.439 align:start position:0%
second hang on I'm going to make some
 
02:46:12.750 --> 02:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
notes here
 
02:46:16.030 --> 02:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
so and if I could just quickly speak to
 
02:46:19.150 --> 02:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
my motion after I've moved and
 
02:46:22.230 --> 02:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative Wallis has seconded um
 
02:46:24.070 --> 02:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
one of the really one of the
 
02:46:26.790 --> 02:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
legislator's leading experts on this
 
02:46:31.150 --> 02:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
subject um is the person who is the
 
02:46:34.750 --> 02:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor the prime sponsor of this bill
 
02:46:37.630 --> 02:46:37.640 align:start position:0%

is real and but at the same
 
02:46:54.510 --> 02:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
time science and law are proceeding a
 
02:46:57.750 --> 02:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
pace and it would be
 
02:47:00.429 --> 02:47:00.439 align:start position:0%
inappropriate at this moment to proceed

motion um to itl House Bill 1710 um is
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
there a
 
04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
second all right um hang
 
04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
on M Mr chair that's following the
 
04:07:17.790 --> 04:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
procedures yeah that have already been
 
04:07:20.269 --> 04:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
that are part of our rules about the
 
04:07:22.469 --> 04:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
chair and the ranking member agreeing
 
04:07:24.469 --> 04:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
right yes the chair right and chair and
 
04:07:27.910 --> 04:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
ranking member do agree on this um all
 
04:07:31.830 --> 04:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
right and so um I guess I I would just
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
speak to the motion briefly uh by saying
 
04:07:37.429 --> 04:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
that um uh the prime sponsor of the bill
 
04:07:39.149 --> 04:07:39.159 align:start position:0%
repres representative Mamilla was just
 
04:07:41.590 --> 04:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
here uh indicated that she requested
 
04:07:45.710 --> 04:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
that the bill be itl um based upon her
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
discussions with the Attorney General's
 
04:07:49.389 --> 04:07:49.399 align:start position:0%
office and the Grafton County Sheriff's
 
04:07:51.990 --> 04:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
Office uh basically believing that the
 
04:07:53.870 --> 04:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
bill needed further work and that
 
04:07:57.109 --> 04:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps there was some other legislation
 
04:08:01.550 --> 04:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
that needed to be passed or or included
 
04:08:04.229 --> 04:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh before this was sort of ready for
 
04:08:06.550 --> 04:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
prime time so to speak and so for that
 
04:08:10.030 --> 04:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
reason she asked it it be uh withdrawn
 
04:08:14.269 --> 04:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
um any other comments on
 
04:08:18.189 --> 04:08:18.199 align:start position:0%

okay and I don't like about that is I
 
04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
don't like giving the impression that we
 
04:09:16.319 --> 04:09:19.870 align:start position:0%
don't like giving the impression that we
don't

04:09:19.870 --> 04:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:23.469 --> 04:09:23.479 align:start position:0%
have sure um all right and I will uh
 
04:09:29.149 --> 04:09:29.159 align:start position:0%

sounds

04:10:14.070 --> 04:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:14.080 --> 04:10:23.229 align:start position:0%
 
good

04:10:23.229 --> 04:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.429 --> 04:10:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.439 --> 04:49:29.310 align:start position:0%
 
that's

04:49:29.310 --> 04:49:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:32.390 --> 04:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's 1:45 I'm going to call the judici

04:49:53.670 --> 04:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
today for the record uh I'm
 
04:49:55.510 --> 04:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative Mike Moffett representing
 
04:49:58.670 --> 04:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
marrat County District 4 the lovely
 
04:50:01.548 --> 04:50:01.558 align:start position:0%
towns of Canterbury and Lowden same as
 
04:50:04.510 --> 04:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
this morning uh so the Gen for this
 
04:50:07.910 --> 04:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
measure coming to you uh began at an
 
04:50:10.470 --> 04:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
ncsl conference I know I said that this
 
04:50:13.628 --> 04:50:13.638 align:start position:0%
morning and the same thing with this one
 
04:50:16.230 --> 04:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh where I attended a panel
 
04:50:18.270 --> 04:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
discussion on on on this subject of
 
04:50:21.030 --> 04:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
minor access to uh
 
04:50:24.548 --> 04:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
hardcore uh internet pornography sites
 
04:50:27.190 --> 04:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
so interesting later uh I after I
 
04:50:28.708 --> 04:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
returned to New Hampshire I heard from
 
04:50:31.310 --> 04:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
former representative uh Susan Homa
 
04:50:34.110 --> 04:50:34.120 align:start position:0%
who's here today uh who is hoping that
 
04:50:38.030 --> 04:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire might join other states in
 
04:50:40.350 --> 04:50:40.360 align:start position:0%
passing legislation that would restrict
 
04:50:44.030 --> 04:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
the access of miners to to hardcore
 
04:50:46.868 --> 04:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
internet sites like PornHub and and the
 
04:50:51.230 --> 04:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
like so successful legislation in this
 
04:50:54.430 --> 04:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
area by other States including Utah and
 
04:50:57.310 --> 04:50:57.320 align:start position:0%
Louisiana provides templates or models
 
04:50:59.910 --> 04:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
to refer to as the committee as this
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
committee looks at hb1
 
04:51:05.430 --> 04:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
1256 uh and I've emailed the committee
 
04:51:08.350 --> 04:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
copies of those uh those two states
 
04:51:10.270 --> 04:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
related laws there are other states out
 
04:51:13.230 --> 04:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
there as well it's the wonders of
 
04:51:16.990 --> 04:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
federalism okay so inevitably a measure
 
04:51:19.788 --> 04:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
of definition is required for a law to
 
04:51:23.830 --> 04:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
be effective so what is
 
04:51:26.390 --> 04:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
pornography what is soft porn as opposed
 
04:51:30.628 --> 04:51:30.638 align:start position:0%
to hard porn uh one person's art is
 
04:51:33.708 --> 04:51:33.718 align:start position:0%
another person's uh vulgar blast
 
04:51:35.830 --> 04:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
blasphemy and there there are certainly
 
04:51:35.840 --> 04:51:36.910 align:start position:0%
blasphemy and there there are certainly
gray

04:51:36.910 --> 04:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
gray
 
04:51:40.230 --> 04:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
areas uh famously most of you have heard
 
04:51:43.190 --> 04:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh the quote from uh Supreme Court
 
04:51:47.430 --> 04:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
Justice the late Potter Stewart uh 1964
 
04:51:50.628 --> 04:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
he TR he was asked you know so what is
 
04:51:53.670 --> 04:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
pornography and it's hard to Define
 
04:51:55.270 --> 04:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
because of what I just said that you
 
04:51:56.990 --> 04:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
know there there's some subjectivity
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
there gray areas and finally Justice
 
04:51:59.040 --> 04:52:00.948 align:start position:0%
there gray areas and finally Justice
Stewart

04:52:00.948 --> 04:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
Stewart
 
04:52:04.470 --> 04:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
said I know it when I see it
 
04:52:07.030 --> 04:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
and I I think I I understood what he was
 
04:52:09.030 --> 04:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
saying and I think most people did as
 
04:52:12.670 --> 04:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
well but the the the challenge for us as
 
04:52:16.590 --> 04:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
lawmakers we we need to Define somewhat
 
04:52:19.310 --> 04:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
Define as best we can what we're talking
 
04:52:22.670 --> 04:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
about in terms of what is
 
04:52:27.030 --> 04:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
pornography so the language in HB 1256
 
04:52:29.910 --> 04:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
attempts to provide a measure of that
 
04:52:33.350 --> 04:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
necessary definition section four part B
 
04:52:35.430 --> 04:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
in particular addresses this need in
 
04:52:38.310 --> 04:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
graphic if not uncomfortable fashion so
 
04:52:42.310 --> 04:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
the words you'll see uh in that part of
 
04:52:45.350 --> 04:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
the measure that part of the build uh
 
04:52:46.868 --> 04:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's a little bit
 
04:52:50.750 --> 04:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable but such verbiage is is
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
necessary so the bill has some specific
 
04:52:57.070 --> 04:52:57.080 align:start position:0%
de definitions as as needed for for
 
04:53:02.590 --> 04:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
these uh relevant terms um in the
 
04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
definition start on one okay so
 
04:53:08.628 --> 04:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
reasonable age verification methods do
 
04:53:13.470 --> 04:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
exist um and that is addressed starting
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
in paragraph 8 line five on page two and
 
04:53:20.110 --> 04:53:20.120 align:start position:0%
I would point out that uh 2019
 
04:53:22.990 --> 04:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
legislation New Hampshire legislation
 
04:53:25.830 --> 04:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
which legalized Sports gambling online
 
04:53:28.910 --> 04:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
sports betting um obviously requires Aid
 
04:53:31.830 --> 04:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
certification technology and that same
 
04:53:33.868 --> 04:53:33.878 align:start position:0%
technology to include the the
 
04:53:37.990 --> 04:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
utilization of uh digitized of a
 
04:53:40.868 --> 04:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
digitized identification card uh could
 
04:53:45.310 --> 04:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
be used in uh with regard to this
 
04:53:47.868 --> 04:53:47.878 align:start position:0%
bill okay and then starting on line 23
 
04:53:50.030 --> 04:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
on page two the bill addresses the the
 
04:53:53.110 --> 04:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
Civil damages piece so like I said I
 
04:53:55.510 --> 04:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
early earlier emailed copies of existing
 
04:53:58.750 --> 04:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
laws from other states so this is the
 
04:54:01.150 --> 04:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
type of legislation that is law in other
 
04:54:05.470 --> 04:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
states so that is always helpful when
 
04:54:07.310 --> 04:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
you're not the first state to try to do
 
04:54:09.548 --> 04:54:09.558 align:start position:0%
something when other states have have
 
04:54:12.430 --> 04:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
succeeded in getting uh certain things
 
04:54:14.868 --> 04:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
in the statute then you know they've
 
04:54:17.030 --> 04:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
done some due diligence of course every
 
04:54:19.548 --> 04:54:19.558 align:start position:0%
State's different but the fact that this
 
04:54:21.470 --> 04:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
measure is in L elsewhere I think is
 
04:54:21.480 --> 04:54:22.708 align:start position:0%
measure is in L elsewhere I think is
very

04:54:22.708 --> 04:54:22.718 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:54:25.670 --> 04:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
significant so uh and as always once the
 
04:54:28.230 --> 04:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
committee receives this bill
 
04:54:32.190 --> 04:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
today um you know the the committee has
 
04:54:33.868 --> 04:54:33.878 align:start position:0%
certainly the discretion to amend
 
04:54:36.190 --> 04:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
language add language change verbiage
 
04:54:37.750 --> 04:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
make technical improvements of course
 
04:54:39.190 --> 04:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
that happens all the
 
04:54:42.510 --> 04:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
time and finally and this is important
 
04:54:45.390 --> 04:54:45.400 align:start position:0%
um considering measures such as this one
 
04:54:48.948 --> 04:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
invites scrutiny from First Amendment
 
04:54:51.150 --> 04:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
Advocates and I happen to be a very
 
04:54:52.590 --> 04:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
staunch First
 
04:54:55.948 --> 04:54:55.958 align:start position:0%
Amendment Advocate um freedom of speech
 
04:54:59.230 --> 04:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
and religion all that uh I'm I'm I'm big
 
04:55:03.150 --> 04:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
on that as some of you know uh I'm I'm
 
04:55:03.160 --> 04:55:03.948 align:start position:0%
on that as some of you know uh I'm I'm
always

04:55:03.948 --> 04:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
always
 
04:55:07.110 --> 04:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
writing Sports columns op ads blog
 
04:55:11.030 --> 04:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
entries uh I I think that the the more
 
04:55:13.868 --> 04:55:13.878 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech there is the the the
 
04:55:17.030 --> 04:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
better now all that said uh there are
 
04:55:18.830 --> 04:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
limits to freedom of speech you you know
 
04:55:20.548 --> 04:55:20.558 align:start position:0%
you can't y'll fire in a crowded theater
 
04:55:23.310 --> 04:55:23.320 align:start position:0%
and all that type of thing and also I
 
04:55:25.548 --> 04:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
don't think that freedom of speech
 
04:55:28.948 --> 04:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
necessarily means that youngsters should
 
04:55:32.990 --> 04:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
have access to to uh some of the online
 
04:55:35.830 --> 04:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
sites that are out there I think it's
 
04:55:38.150 --> 04:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
our job I think our
 
04:55:40.548 --> 04:55:40.558 align:start position:0%
constituents as in other states want us
 
04:55:44.628 --> 04:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
to uh have some guard rails in this
 
04:55:48.070 --> 04:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
area so this bill would not infringe on
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
adult access or use of these sites and
 
04:55:54.150 --> 04:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
and there's plenty of precedent in terms
 
04:55:55.830 --> 04:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
of restricting
 
04:55:59.948 --> 04:55:59.958 align:start position:0%
minor access to uh adult forms of
 
04:56:01.830 --> 04:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
entertainment you know youngsters can't
 
04:56:05.350 --> 04:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
go into certain uh gentlemen's clubs or
 
04:56:09.470 --> 04:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
whatever or uh we restrict access or we
 
04:56:12.470 --> 04:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
require ID we have for a long time in
 
04:56:16.430 --> 04:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
terms of uh x-rated or irrated uh
 
04:56:20.548 --> 04:56:20.558 align:start position:0%
films uh we control that and this is not
 
04:56:23.150 --> 04:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
unlike that you know restricting access
 
04:56:26.788 --> 04:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
of youngsters to uh movie theaters well
 
04:56:29.070 --> 04:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
this is the online version of that
 
04:56:33.070 --> 04:56:33.080 align:start position:0%
really it's kind of as simple as that so
 
04:56:35.230 --> 04:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
uh limiting minor access to online
 
04:56:37.430 --> 04:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
hardcore pornography involves mental
 
04:56:38.910 --> 04:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
health issues you'll hear more about
 
04:56:41.830 --> 04:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
that in a bit um as well as moral issues
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
and illegal issues you know child porn
 
04:56:47.310 --> 04:56:47.320 align:start position:0%
is already uh you know
 
04:56:50.150 --> 04:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
illegal and this goes beyond that simply
 
04:56:53.548 --> 04:56:53.558 align:start position:0%
seeking to uh restrict access to
 
04:56:56.310 --> 04:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
hardcore pornographic sites uh
 
04:56:58.510 --> 04:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
protecting young people
 
04:57:02.230 --> 04:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
from uh accidentally or int
 
04:57:04.390 --> 04:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
intentionally getting on to these uh
 
04:57:08.628 --> 04:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
these sites so hb1 1256 represents an
 
04:57:10.590 --> 04:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
overdue initiative to better protect
 
04:57:12.750 --> 04:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
minors in this area in New Hampshire and
 
04:57:14.030 --> 04:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
like I said there should be some helpful
 
04:57:16.110 --> 04:57:16.120 align:start position:0%
testimony to follow but I would first be
 
04:57:18.750 --> 04:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
happy to try to answer any questions if
 
04:57:20.670 --> 04:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
if there are
 
04:57:23.590 --> 04:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Alexander
 
04:57:24.670 --> 04:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:57:26.750 --> 04:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
04:57:28.910 --> 04:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just thinking off the top of my
 
04:57:31.708 --> 04:57:31.718 align:start position:0%
head so a mom and pop
 
04:57:33.390 --> 04:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
restaurant there's there's there's a
 
04:57:34.868 --> 04:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
minor going into a mom and pop
 
04:57:37.070 --> 04:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
restaurant having breakfast and the
 
04:57:41.150 --> 04:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
minor uses the Wi-Fi to look up pornh
 
04:57:44.270 --> 04:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
Hub I understand at the end it says the
 
04:57:45.948 --> 04:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
internet service is not going to be held
 
04:57:48.670 --> 04:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
liable but is there any language in here
 
04:57:50.910 --> 04:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
that would say that the mom and pop
 
04:57:54.510 --> 04:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant by not restricting PornHub
 
04:57:56.150 --> 04:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
they would be held
 
04:57:58.510 --> 04:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
liable that is a great question and it's
 
04:58:00.590 --> 04:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
something I hadn't thought of somebody
 
04:58:02.230 --> 04:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
the scenario you just described going
 
04:58:04.270 --> 04:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
into as you say and pop restaurant
 
04:58:07.548 --> 04:58:07.558 align:start position:0%
establishment where there is a uh you
 
04:58:09.948 --> 04:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
you ask them what their Wi-Fi is and you
 
04:58:13.510 --> 04:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
sign in uh uh I I hate to throw it back
 
04:58:15.628 --> 04:58:15.638 align:start position:0%
at the committee but that that's the
 
04:58:19.510 --> 04:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
type of uh Improvement uh that I hadn't
 
04:58:21.150 --> 04:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
thought of we hadn't thought of that
 
04:58:23.350 --> 04:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
could uh hopefully be easily addressed
 
04:58:25.350 --> 04:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
in some fashion if if this moves forward
 
04:58:27.270 --> 04:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and I I
 
04:58:29.190 --> 04:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
apologize for not thinking of it before
 
04:58:31.750 --> 04:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
we put this together well it it's okay
 
04:58:33.430 --> 04:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
we're we are subject matter expert on
 
04:58:37.788 --> 04:58:37.798 align:start position:0%
this I like to say anyways but um the
 
04:58:41.548 --> 04:58:41.558 align:start position:0%
the supposedly anyways so um I'm also
 
04:58:41.558 --> 04:58:44.910 align:start position:0%
the supposedly anyways so um I'm also
looking

04:58:44.910 --> 04:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:47.868 --> 04:58:47.878 align:start position:0%
at okay I'm also looking at the damages
 
04:58:47.878 --> 04:58:50.110 align:start position:0%
at okay I'm also looking at the damages
component

04:58:50.110 --> 04:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
component
 
04:58:53.510 --> 04:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
um I just see hold on where am I
 
04:58:57.070 --> 04:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
looking um section D2 civil damages I
 
04:58:58.990 --> 04:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
just see
 
04:59:01.548 --> 04:59:01.558 align:start position:0%
um shall be liable individual for
 
04:59:03.510 --> 04:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
damages resulting retaining identifying
 
04:59:06.868 --> 04:59:06.878 align:start position:0%
personal information I I find that to be
 
04:59:10.270 --> 04:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
broad so if there's a an attorney or
 
04:59:11.990 --> 04:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
somebody that can help me give me
 
04:59:15.190 --> 04:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
information on like what that would
 
04:59:18.470 --> 04:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
entail um emotional damage physical
 
04:59:21.110 --> 04:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
damage um psych I don't know there's
 
04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
like there's a ton of different damages
 
04:59:24.510 --> 04:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
that could be awarded so I know
 
04:59:25.948 --> 04:59:25.958 align:start position:0%
represented maet you might not have the
 
04:59:28.030 --> 04:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
answer to that but I'm asking it now so
 
04:59:30.590 --> 04:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
that somebody might be able to sure and
 
04:59:33.548 --> 04:59:33.558 align:start position:0%
I I know this is uh is on will be
 
04:59:35.590 --> 04:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
speaking of online this will be online
 
04:59:37.750 --> 04:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
of course these hearings are rated G
 
04:59:41.030 --> 04:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
usually and so anyone can watch them and
 
04:59:42.830 --> 04:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
and someone who is watching this who
 
04:59:44.788 --> 04:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
hears that great question uh maybe could
 
04:59:47.190 --> 04:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
help us out or or certainly there are
 
04:59:48.910 --> 04:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
experts and maybe somebody who's going
 
04:59:50.948 --> 04:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
to testify after me might be able to
 
04:59:55.350 --> 04:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
speak to that uh we need to have in this
 
04:59:58.110 --> 04:59:58.120 align:start position:0%
case uh some uh consequence you know if
 
05:00:00.590 --> 05:00:00.600 align:start position:0%
somebody breaks we have enough Lawes
 
05:00:02.708 --> 05:00:02.718 align:start position:0%
where that if people break them there's
 
05:00:04.548 --> 05:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
there's not a a clear
 
05:00:07.070 --> 05:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
consequence uh so to have a civil
 
05:00:09.868 --> 05:00:09.878 align:start position:0%
damages section here which we put in I
 
05:00:13.510 --> 05:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
think is important and uh and again as I
 
05:00:15.230 --> 05:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
said this morning that the beauty of
 
05:00:17.150 --> 05:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee when we're talking
 
05:00:21.548 --> 05:00:21.558 align:start position:0%
about law is that a there's there is a
 
05:00:23.590 --> 05:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
wealth uh representative Smith to
 
05:00:26.070 --> 05:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
include yourself a wealth of knowledge
 
05:00:30.110 --> 05:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
to u to you know uh look at the wording
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
and improve
 
05:00:34.628 --> 05:00:34.638 align:start position:0%
it good question thanks for the question
 
05:00:37.548 --> 05:00:37.558 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you other questions for
 
05:00:41.430 --> 05:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
this this witness um I I guess I just
 
05:00:44.948 --> 05:00:44.958 align:start position:0%
have a couple of questions um Mr maford
 
05:00:46.190 --> 05:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
and representative maford and maybe
 
05:00:47.750 --> 05:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
there'll be others that can address this
 
05:00:51.750 --> 05:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
but um in the definition
 
05:00:55.628 --> 05:00:55.638 align:start position:0%
of uh material harmful to
 
05:00:59.868 --> 05:00:59.878 align:start position:0%
miners the my recollection from you know
 
05:01:02.150 --> 05:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
having read Supreme Court cases in this
 
05:01:04.590 --> 05:01:04.600 align:start position:0%
area is is that the language you've
 
05:01:06.548 --> 05:01:06.558 align:start position:0%
quoted does come from you know various
 
05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court cases my only question
 
05:01:13.270 --> 05:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
is my recollection is
 
05:01:16.830 --> 05:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
that a uh in Roman numeral
 
05:01:19.470 --> 05:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
4 A B and
 
05:01:23.470 --> 05:01:23.480 align:start position:0%
C my recollection is that those are sort
 
05:01:26.190 --> 05:01:26.200 align:start position:0%
in the case law that those
 
05:01:28.708 --> 05:01:28.718 align:start position:0%
are cumulative in other words it should
 
05:01:32.590 --> 05:01:32.600 align:start position:0%
be material is uh that is covered has to
 
05:01:36.430 --> 05:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
set satisfy A and B and
 
05:01:40.868 --> 05:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
C that that's my recollection because um
 
05:01:43.150 --> 05:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
if that were not the
 
05:01:47.628 --> 05:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
case if it were a or b or c then just as
 
05:01:49.830 --> 05:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
an example if it were only C material
 
05:01:53.390 --> 05:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
taken as a whole LAX serious literary
 
05:01:55.750 --> 05:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
artistic political or scientific that
 
05:01:58.470 --> 05:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
could be something that had no sexual
 
05:02:00.350 --> 05:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
component whatsoever you might say you
 
05:02:03.910 --> 05:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
know completely lacked uh some so I
 
05:02:07.510 --> 05:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
think it probably has to be a and b and
 
05:02:12.270 --> 05:02:12.280 align:start position:0%
and c I I think but um yes Mr that that
 
05:02:15.670 --> 05:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
is the intent that is it line 12 it's
 
05:02:17.310 --> 05:02:17.320 align:start position:0%
where paragraph four starts it it does
 
05:02:19.868 --> 05:02:19.878 align:start position:0%
say is defined as all of the following
 
05:02:22.830 --> 05:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
that's correct well no you're I'm sorry
 
05:02:26.310 --> 05:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
you're so that would C that you're right
 
05:02:28.750 --> 05:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
that was not I was not carefully reading
 
05:02:30.310 --> 05:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
it but I think you're right you does you
 
05:02:32.548 --> 05:02:32.558 align:start position:0%
do cover that all of the following all
 
05:02:34.708 --> 05:02:34.718 align:start position:0%
right there is like see there is a lot
 
05:02:37.910 --> 05:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
of material that lacks serious lit
 
05:02:40.470 --> 05:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
literary artistic political scientific
 
05:02:42.708 --> 05:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
value for minors that by itself could
 
05:02:46.310 --> 05:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
cover all kinds of things but to add to
 
05:02:49.510 --> 05:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
combine it with A and B to your point so
 
05:02:51.350 --> 05:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
better yeah you know as I just as I
 
05:02:52.708 --> 05:02:52.718 align:start position:0%
think about
 
05:02:55.830 --> 05:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
it arguably saying all of the following
 
05:02:55.840 --> 05:02:56.670 align:start position:0%
it arguably saying all of the following
does

05:02:56.670 --> 05:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:02:59.430 --> 05:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
not it could be meant to me it could be
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
meant to
 
05:03:04.390 --> 05:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
cover it still could be read to be a or
 
05:03:06.830 --> 05:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
b or c so maybe we'd have to you know
 
05:03:08.510 --> 05:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
include the word and there or something
 
05:03:11.190 --> 05:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
like that or just just yeah
 
05:03:13.548 --> 05:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
just right just you know we we can
 
05:03:15.390 --> 05:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
Tinker we could Tinker with that
 
05:03:20.390 --> 05:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
language a little bit um other other
 
05:03:24.270 --> 05:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
questions yes uh representative Staples
 
05:03:25.788 --> 05:03:25.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:03:29.708 --> 05:03:29.718 align:start position:0%
my question the bill seems to avoid
 
05:03:33.430 --> 05:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
the obviously the use of the term
 
05:03:36.670 --> 05:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
pornography and um you did mention uh
 
05:03:39.990 --> 05:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
the 1954 Justice Stewart I missed what
 
05:03:43.190 --> 05:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
he said on that um relative to what
 
05:03:45.910 --> 05:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
pornography was what was that quote what
 
05:03:49.750 --> 05:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
Justice Stewart said in 1964 yeah
 
05:03:52.670 --> 05:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh it's I've heard this a number of
 
05:03:54.670 --> 05:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
times in terms of defining pornography
 
05:03:56.830 --> 05:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
in in Justice Stewart in
 
05:04:00.590 --> 05:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
1964 said that it he was talking about
 
05:04:02.708 --> 05:04:02.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's difficult to Define
 
05:04:04.110 --> 05:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
pornography that's the challenge that I
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
acknowledged a front and he said uh he
 
05:04:09.430 --> 05:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
finally said I know it when I see
 
05:04:12.990 --> 05:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
it and I think I understood what he was
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
saying but him or any of us saying
 
05:04:18.070 --> 05:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
something and and feeling that it's uh
 
05:04:20.270 --> 05:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
inappropriate uh
 
05:04:23.070 --> 05:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
pornography uh that that's why I I
 
05:04:25.628 --> 05:04:25.638 align:start position:0%
touched on the the difficult some of the
 
05:04:28.230 --> 05:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
words in here are are hard to read
 
05:04:31.070 --> 05:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
frankly uh but they need to be in there
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
so that we can have that definition
 
05:04:34.590 --> 05:04:34.600 align:start position:0%
Beyond knowing it when you see it yeah
 
05:04:37.510 --> 05:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
that was I know it when I see it Potter
 
05:04:37.520 --> 05:04:38.788 align:start position:0%
that was I know it when I see it Potter
St

05:04:38.788 --> 05:04:38.798 align:start position:0%
St
 
05:04:42.190 --> 05:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
1964 and uh and the challenge is to
 
05:04:44.590 --> 05:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
Define it better than that so hopefully
 
05:04:47.510 --> 05:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
what we've given you here is is a plus
 
05:04:48.990 --> 05:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
what I've already sent you from what
 
05:04:50.910 --> 05:04:50.920 align:start position:0%

use to define pornography wouldn't
 
05:06:29.110 --> 05:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
really be very nice to put in a
 
05:06:33.110 --> 05:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
bill um and I will also say that
 
05:06:35.628 --> 05:06:35.638 align:start position:0%

acts on on uh on the internet and it's a
 
05:06:51.548 --> 05:06:51.558 align:start position:0%
cause for concern and I hope this bill
 
05:06:55.390 --> 05:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh gets the attention that it
 
05:06:57.868 --> 05:06:57.878 align:start position:0%
deserves three and a half years ago I
 
05:07:01.310 --> 05:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
ran to represent Milford as a state
 
05:07:03.948 --> 05:07:03.958 align:start position:0%
representative I ran because of my
 
05:07:06.230 --> 05:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
passion to help those suffering from
 
05:07:09.390 --> 05:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
addiction originally the desire came
 
05:07:11.788 --> 05:07:11.798 align:start position:0%
from my relationship with Ark NH in
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
Milford and substance use
 
05:07:17.548 --> 05:07:17.558 align:start position:0%

Health Human Services and elderly
 
05:07:21.670 --> 05:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
Affairs committee I learned there was a
 
05:07:24.150 --> 05:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
lot more to addiction than
 
05:07:26.830 --> 05:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
Suds at the root of much addiction is
 
05:07:26.840 --> 05:07:27.990 align:start position:0%
Suds at the root of much addiction is
mental

05:07:27.990 --> 05:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
mental
 
05:07:30.788 --> 05:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
health mental health has now become my
 
05:07:33.548 --> 05:07:33.558 align:start position:0%
main focus and one Factor driving poor
 
05:07:36.190 --> 05:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
mental health starts with what our
 
05:07:39.510 --> 05:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
teenagers and sadly younger are exposed
 
05:07:41.430 --> 05:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
to on their cell phones and their
 
05:07:43.670 --> 05:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
computers through the internet
 
05:07:46.548 --> 05:07:46.558 align:start position:0%
content pornography is one of such
 
05:07:49.708 --> 05:07:49.718 align:start position:0%
influence our kids are experiencing and
 
05:07:51.390 --> 05:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
it is easy to
 
05:07:53.830 --> 05:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
access this bill is an attempt to make
 
05:07:56.788 --> 05:07:56.798 align:start position:0%
it harder for kids to access porn on
 
05:07:56.798 --> 05:07:57.948 align:start position:0%
it harder for kids to access porn on
their

05:07:57.948 --> 05:07:57.958 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:08:00.510 --> 05:08:00.520 align:start position:0%

05:08:04.510 --> 05:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
2023 at the uh DHHS oversight committee
 
05:08:07.230 --> 05:08:07.240 align:start position:0%

05:08:15.270 --> 05:08:15.280 align:start position:0%

05:08:17.590 --> 05:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
Children and Youth are exposed to
 
05:08:21.190 --> 05:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
messages from social media influencers
 
05:08:23.990 --> 05:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
which I would consider this one hidden
 
05:08:26.590 --> 05:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
ads in video games data collection
 
05:08:29.510 --> 05:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
across many platforms such as this
 
05:08:32.150 --> 05:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
virtually re virtual reality and
 
05:08:34.390 --> 05:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
encounters with strangers in games and
 
05:08:36.548 --> 05:08:36.558 align:start position:0%
targeted social media advertisements
 
05:08:39.788 --> 05:08:39.798 align:start position:0%
that are intended to make children take
 
05:08:43.628 --> 05:08:43.638 align:start position:0%
action porn sites are just one area that
 
05:08:45.548 --> 05:08:45.558 align:start position:0%
are impacting our
 
05:08:48.230 --> 05:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
children the bill is not a new concept
 
05:08:50.628 --> 05:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
as representative mafit did a very very
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
good job uh introducing this and um
 
05:08:57.590 --> 05:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
there's there is a similar version uh
 
05:09:00.310 --> 05:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
that passed the initial one passed in L
 
05:09:04.030 --> 05:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
Louisiana in 2022 so these this has not
 
05:09:06.750 --> 05:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
had a lot of time to to Really grab
 
05:09:09.470 --> 05:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
traction however he did also mention uh
 
05:09:12.350 --> 05:09:12.360 align:start position:0%

Montana Virginia and Texas have passed
 
05:09:15.480 --> 05:09:16.628 align:start position:0%
Montana Virginia and Texas have passed
similar

05:09:16.628 --> 05:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
similar
 
05:09:19.670 --> 05:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
bills you may ask does this bill
 
05:09:22.590 --> 05:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
accomplish what it sets out to do reduce
 
05:09:25.750 --> 05:09:25.760 align:start position:0%

branch if you think this may have been
 
05:10:00.590 --> 05:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
promoted by Evangelical Christians think
 
05:10:03.788 --> 05:10:03.798 align:start position:0%
again this bill actually got its start
 
05:10:06.670 --> 05:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
when representative schel was listening
 
05:10:09.750 --> 05:10:09.760 align:start position:0%

05:10:17.750 --> 05:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
destroyed his brain and how he felt
 
05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
incredibly devastated that he was
 
05:10:22.590 --> 05:10:22.600 align:start position:0%

05:10:25.070 --> 05:10:25.080 align:start position:0%

05:11:00.958 --> 05:11:03.948 align:start position:0%
 
Smith

05:11:03.948 --> 05:11:03.958 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
05:11:07.230 --> 05:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not really sure how to ask
 
05:11:07.240 --> 05:11:08.750 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not really sure how to ask
this

05:11:08.750 --> 05:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:11:12.830 --> 05:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
question I am under the
 
05:11:16.708 --> 05:11:16.718 align:start position:0%
impression that first of all most
 
05:11:20.708 --> 05:11:20.718 align:start position:0%
electronic devices have on and off
 
05:11:24.750 --> 05:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
switches and second that
 
05:11:29.750 --> 05:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
I and I think I am not alone take very
 
05:11:32.708 --> 05:11:32.718 align:start position:0%
strongly responsibility
 
05:11:35.830 --> 05:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
to I mean I took it to my children I see
 
05:11:38.590 --> 05:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
my children take that responsibility to
 
05:11:38.600 --> 05:11:39.548 align:start position:0%
my children take that responsibility to
my

05:11:39.548 --> 05:11:39.558 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:11:42.590 --> 05:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
grandchildren of making
 
05:11:46.510 --> 05:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
sure that there are limits that have
 
05:11:46.520 --> 05:11:47.788 align:start position:0%
sure that there are limits that have
been

05:11:47.788 --> 05:11:47.798 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
established according to that
 
05:11:50.638 --> 05:11:58.110 align:start position:0%
established according to that
family's

05:11:58.110 --> 05:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:03.628 --> 05:12:03.638 align:start position:0%
values I don't really see
 
05:12:07.708 --> 05:12:07.718 align:start position:0%
how this is going to help and I must be
 
05:12:10.190 --> 05:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
missing something I understand that so
 
05:12:12.628 --> 05:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
help me help me understand what I'm
 
05:12:15.390 --> 05:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
missing so I'm I'm not a computer
 
05:12:18.910 --> 05:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
science expert but I will let you know
 
05:12:22.030 --> 05:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
and the entire committee as as well
 
05:12:24.868 --> 05:12:24.878 align:start position:0%
there is a huge education that we as
 
05:12:26.868 --> 05:12:26.878 align:start position:0%
adults need to learn about the
 
05:12:29.628 --> 05:12:29.638 align:start position:0%
technology that is is in the hands of
 
05:12:32.750 --> 05:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
our kids there are way ways around
 
05:12:35.030 --> 05:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
things that the parents think they've
 
05:12:38.230 --> 05:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
set up and you're
 
05:12:42.190 --> 05:12:42.200 align:start position:0%
wrong there are ways of logging in under
 
05:12:45.350 --> 05:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
one and making it look like your parents
 
05:12:47.230 --> 05:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
have control on your
 
05:12:49.830 --> 05:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
device and then as soon as the parents
 
05:12:52.390 --> 05:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
are out of sight they log in under
 
05:12:54.708 --> 05:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
something else and there's a totally
 
05:12:56.948 --> 05:12:56.958 align:start position:0%
different access that they
 
05:13:00.548 --> 05:13:00.558 align:start position:0%
have the uh the power that these kids
 
05:13:02.110 --> 05:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
have with their cell phones and the
 
05:13:04.670 --> 05:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
internet access that they have is
 
05:13:07.030 --> 05:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
tremendous and we cannot UND
 
05:13:07.040 --> 05:13:10.070 align:start position:0%
tremendous and we cannot UND
underestimate

05:13:10.070 --> 05:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:12.990 --> 05:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
that representative Alexander thank you
 
05:13:15.590 --> 05:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair just to follow up on that if
 
05:13:18.150 --> 05:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
what you say is true what is this going
 
05:13:18.160 --> 05:13:19.150 align:start position:0%
what you say is true what is this going
to

05:13:19.150 --> 05:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:13:21.670 --> 05:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
do we're a bunch of adults trying to
 
05:13:23.708 --> 05:13:23.718 align:start position:0%
regulate what children do and you're
 
05:13:26.030 --> 05:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
saying that they're smarter than what we
 
05:13:27.990 --> 05:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
think I mean I'm 29 I think I know my
 
05:13:30.190 --> 05:13:30.200 align:start position:0%
way around a smartphone but maybe an
 
05:13:32.310 --> 05:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
18-year-old knows more 17 15y old I'm
 
05:13:34.510 --> 05:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
not sure there's an old saying that if
 
05:13:36.548 --> 05:13:36.558 align:start position:0%
you can't figure out your cell phone
 
05:13:37.548 --> 05:13:37.558 align:start position:0%
find a
 
05:13:41.310 --> 05:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
14-year-old um uh but seriously what
 
05:13:43.510 --> 05:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
this bill does is it doesn't control
 
05:13:46.110 --> 05:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
what's going on on on this side of the
 
05:13:47.868 --> 05:13:47.878 align:start position:0%
cell phone it's controlling what's
 
05:13:49.430 --> 05:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
happening on the other side of the cell
 
05:13:53.948 --> 05:13:53.958 align:start position:0%
phone and so um they can't they can't
 
05:13:56.070 --> 05:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
allow access unless they prove that
 
05:14:00.670 --> 05:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:00.680 --> 05:14:07.510 align:start position:0%
 
older

05:14:07.510 --> 05:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:10.830 --> 05:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
sorry about that sorry no problem right
 
05:14:14.788 --> 05:14:14.798 align:start position:0%
um other question yes representative
 
05:14:18.150 --> 05:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
Stapleton well this is a difficult one
 
05:14:23.190 --> 05:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
because 10 plus years ago um first
 
05:14:25.990 --> 05:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
episode was
 
05:14:29.628 --> 05:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
sexting and then even then the kids were
 
05:14:32.350 --> 05:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
far ahead of us because they would had
 
05:14:34.868 --> 05:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
images and they took images of
 
05:14:37.868 --> 05:14:37.878 align:start position:0%
themselves or their associate students
 
05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
and sent them all over and to one
 
05:14:42.230 --> 05:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
another and hideous
 
05:14:45.110 --> 05:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
stuff um and you know we were blind to
 
05:14:49.150 --> 05:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
it and I only found out about it when my
 
05:14:49.160 --> 05:14:50.948 align:start position:0%
it and I only found out about it when my
8-year-old

05:14:50.948 --> 05:14:50.958 align:start position:0%
8-year-old
 
05:14:54.190 --> 05:14:54.200 align:start position:0%
grandson um had pictures on his cell
 
05:14:56.990 --> 05:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
phone that were in appropriate and we
 
05:14:59.750 --> 05:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
corrected that right away but they are
 
05:15:02.070 --> 05:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
so far ahead of us we do need to have
 
05:15:05.110 --> 05:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
some guard rails and stop measures um
 
05:15:06.990 --> 05:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's just going to get worse
 
05:15:09.310 --> 05:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
as you point out in your fine testimony
 
05:15:13.548 --> 05:15:13.558 align:start position:0%
here thank you thank you other
 
05:15:16.788 --> 05:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
questions so represent I wonder if I
 
05:15:18.548 --> 05:15:18.558 align:start position:0%
could just uh follow up on a question
 
05:15:20.628 --> 05:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
that representative Alexander asked
 
05:15:23.910 --> 05:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
earlier it it's my understanding that
 
05:15:28.230 --> 05:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
let's use the PornHub as the example
 
05:15:32.310 --> 05:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding is that what this
 
05:15:34.590 --> 05:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
bill is intended to do is
 
05:15:37.110 --> 05:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
to stop
 
05:15:39.910 --> 05:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
PornHub from
 
05:15:42.750 --> 05:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
Distributing uh uh pornographic material
 
05:15:46.150 --> 05:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
to miners by requiring them to
 
05:15:48.868 --> 05:15:48.878 align:start position:0%
get appropriate verification that the
 
05:15:51.990 --> 05:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
person's over uh 18 years old that is
 
05:15:58.868 --> 05:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:02.030 --> 05:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
not clear on is
 
05:16:05.070 --> 05:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
if to use to go back to his example if
 
05:16:07.510 --> 05:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
if I own a small restaurant that has
 
05:16:07.520 --> 05:16:08.948 align:start position:0%
if I own a small restaurant that has
internet

05:16:08.948 --> 05:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
internet
 
05:16:12.230 --> 05:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
service and I and I you know I obviously
 
05:16:14.750 --> 05:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
know that something called pornhub or or
 
05:16:17.590 --> 05:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
like things exist on the
 
05:16:17.600 --> 05:16:19.750 align:start position:0%
like things exist on the
internet

05:16:19.750 --> 05:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
internet
 
05:16:23.470 --> 05:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
um and I and I am aware that
 
05:16:23.480 --> 05:16:25.310 align:start position:0%
um and I and I am aware that
PornHub

05:16:25.310 --> 05:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
PornHub
 
05:16:27.868 --> 05:16:27.878 align:start position:0%
can you know that somebody that somebody
 
05:16:30.788 --> 05:16:30.798 align:start position:0%
that uh uh has access to the internet
 
05:16:34.150 --> 05:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
can get on to uh to pornhub by doing
 
05:16:35.910 --> 05:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
that am
 
05:16:39.788 --> 05:16:39.798 align:start position:0%
I am I is the intent of this to make me
 
05:16:43.910 --> 05:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
liable if I don't do something to make
 
05:16:45.830 --> 05:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
sure that the kids that come into my
 
05:16:48.590 --> 05:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
restaurant are not you know accessing
 
05:16:51.390 --> 05:16:51.400 align:start position:0%
PornHub that is not the intent of the
 
05:16:53.470 --> 05:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
bill it the intent is to put the
 
05:16:56.708 --> 05:16:56.718 align:start position:0%
responsibility on PornHub or uh site
 
05:17:00.430 --> 05:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
similar to that I will also say that uh
 
05:17:02.628 --> 05:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
in my days working in
 
05:17:05.830 --> 05:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
corporate um porn was something that
 
05:17:09.150 --> 05:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
would show up on people's computers and
 
05:17:12.910 --> 05:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
the IT people would go in Block sites so
 
05:17:16.830 --> 05:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
if that's something um that you know if
 
05:17:19.470 --> 05:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
the day comes and restaurants are
 
05:17:22.150 --> 05:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
worried about or whoever is offering
 
05:17:24.990 --> 05:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
internet service they can have somebody
 
05:17:26.628 --> 05:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
come in and block sites or they can
 
05:17:29.070 --> 05:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
block the sites themselves right but I
 
05:17:30.670 --> 05:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
mean just just because I think the
 
05:17:32.070 --> 05:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
question the point he was getting at
 
05:17:33.910 --> 05:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
that I would be also worried about is
 
05:17:36.670 --> 05:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's not the intent of this bill
 
05:17:38.548 --> 05:17:38.558 align:start position:0%
and maybe we need to make adjust the
 
05:17:39.868 --> 05:17:39.878 align:start position:0%
language a little bit but it's not the
 
05:17:42.990 --> 05:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill to impose upon the
 
05:17:46.350 --> 05:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
restaurant in my example the obligation
 
05:17:48.868 --> 05:17:48.878 align:start position:0%
to to uh police the internet in other
 
05:17:51.470 --> 05:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
words they're not required
 
05:17:56.390 --> 05:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
to arrange their internet service so
 
05:17:59.670 --> 05:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
that PornHub is blocked that's correct
 
05:18:03.990 --> 05:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh yes representative
 
05:18:07.910 --> 05:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
Smith if you're right and it probably
 
05:18:10.948 --> 05:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
are that these young people who you're
 
05:18:13.548 --> 05:18:13.558 align:start position:0%
talking about are much more Adept than
 
05:18:13.558 --> 05:18:15.390 align:start position:0%
talking about are much more Adept than
we

05:18:15.390 --> 05:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:18:19.110 --> 05:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
are what
 
05:18:24.070 --> 05:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
is what is to prevent them these unnamed
 
05:18:24.080 --> 05:18:24.990 align:start position:0%
is what is to prevent them these unnamed
young

05:18:24.990 --> 05:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
young
 
05:18:30.230 --> 05:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
people from beating the system uh
 
05:18:32.788 --> 05:18:32.798 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know filling out whatever
 
05:18:35.470 --> 05:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
form has to be filled out to claim that
 
05:18:39.070 --> 05:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
they are over 18 and that it's all right
 
05:18:43.948 --> 05:18:43.958 align:start position:0%
to subject them to this
 
05:18:47.310 --> 05:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
um you know where does
 
05:18:51.030 --> 05:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
that protection come and I will tell you
 
05:18:53.510 --> 05:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
that I mean maybe I shouldn't say this
 
05:18:56.270 --> 05:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
publicly but I will I have had one
 
05:18:59.948 --> 05:18:59.958 align:start position:0%
occasion in all my years to have a
 
05:19:02.430 --> 05:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
fleeting glimp Glimpse at something that
 
05:19:04.030 --> 05:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
would be called
 
05:19:07.670 --> 05:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
pornography and it was on a
 
05:19:07.680 --> 05:19:09.510 align:start position:0%
pornography and it was on a
state

05:19:09.510 --> 05:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:19:12.350 --> 05:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
computer in room
 
05:19:18.910 --> 05:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
100 of the um of the state housee I
 
05:19:20.430 --> 05:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
froze I was
 
05:19:24.430 --> 05:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
shocked um and immediately went to we
 
05:19:26.510 --> 05:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
didn't have an IT office then but went
 
05:19:28.948 --> 05:19:28.958 align:start position:0%
to the appropriate people who who
 
05:19:31.788 --> 05:19:31.798 align:start position:0%
blocked it yeah um but
 
05:19:35.628 --> 05:19:35.638 align:start position:0%
so I'm not speaking as an expert here
 
05:19:38.030 --> 05:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
but you're saying the kids are experts
 
05:19:39.470 --> 05:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
and that they do know how to beat the
 
05:19:42.990 --> 05:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
system so why wouldn't they beat this
 
05:19:46.310 --> 05:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
system I guess there's no guarantees at
 
05:19:50.150 --> 05:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
all in life but I like the when
 
05:19:52.470 --> 05:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
representative Mafia used the word guard
 
05:19:54.190 --> 05:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
rails and actually representative
 
05:19:59.070 --> 05:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
Alexander repeated that uh I I would say
 
05:20:03.868 --> 05:20:03.878 align:start position:0%
it's it's you know how how can we
 
05:20:07.430 --> 05:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
actually guarantee that everybody will
 
05:20:10.868 --> 05:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
drive 65 and under when the speed limit
 
05:20:10.878 --> 05:20:12.230 align:start position:0%
drive 65 and under when the speed limit
is

05:20:12.230 --> 05:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:20:15.190 --> 05:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
65 um
 
05:20:17.150 --> 05:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
there I don't think there's any
 
05:20:18.948 --> 05:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
guarantee but I think what this law will
 
05:20:21.868 --> 05:20:21.878 align:start position:0%
do will will it will significantly cut
 
05:20:25.830 --> 05:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
down on uh just your average youth that
 
05:20:30.110 --> 05:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:33.190 --> 05:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
sites other questions for this
 
05:20:35.470 --> 05:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
05:20:38.548 --> 05:20:38.558 align:start position:0%
sir thank you I'm next going to call on
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:50.510 --> 05:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
please thank you and thank you for
 
05:20:53.030 --> 05:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
giving me the opportunity to um to speak
 
05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
to this bill I I just want to start by
 
05:20:56.750 --> 05:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
saying I I really appreciate rep Moffett
 
05:20:59.030 --> 05:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
and all the other bipartisan group of
 
05:21:00.750 --> 05:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors who've joined together to
 
05:21:03.430 --> 05:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
advocate for youth health and for uh
 
05:21:05.190 --> 05:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
youth health and Youth Development it's
 
05:21:06.510 --> 05:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
very very much
 
05:21:09.510 --> 05:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
appreciated um I'll start reading some
 
05:21:11.150 --> 05:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
of the testimony I have but but based
 
05:21:12.628 --> 05:21:12.638 align:start position:0%
off some of the comments I'm glad that
 
05:21:14.070 --> 05:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
I'm here because I can speak to the
 
05:21:20.070 --> 05:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
parental issue and um also we're the
 
05:21:23.070 --> 05:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill really is to add in
 
05:21:24.430 --> 05:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
a layer of age
 
05:21:28.750 --> 05:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
verification onto sites that this is
 
05:21:32.390 --> 05:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
their business to have elicit material
 
05:21:34.190 --> 05:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
so that we can ensure ensure that the
 
05:21:35.750 --> 05:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
people that are viewing this illicit
 
05:21:38.548 --> 05:21:38.558 align:start position:0%
material aren't under the legal age of
 
05:21:41.430 --> 05:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
adulthood that's the intent and in
 
05:21:42.948 --> 05:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
discussing some of the like the State
 
05:21:45.150 --> 05:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
House website and this in the bill it it
 
05:21:46.910 --> 05:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
actually clearly states that this is
 
05:21:49.548 --> 05:21:49.558 align:start position:0%
intended for a commercial entity that
 
05:21:51.270 --> 05:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
knowingly or intentionally publishes and
 
05:21:54.830 --> 05:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
distributes material um that for which
 
05:21:57.030 --> 05:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
this is their business so this isn't an
 
05:21:59.310 --> 05:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
accidental kind of a you know there's
 
05:22:01.590 --> 05:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
something on some accident site that
 
05:22:04.110 --> 05:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
comes through the State House
 
05:22:06.750 --> 05:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
algorithms um I would like to say that
 
05:22:08.750 --> 05:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
online pornography is incredibly easy
 
05:22:11.150 --> 05:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
for adolescence to to access due to the
 
05:22:12.990 --> 05:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
lack of age verification
 
05:22:15.470 --> 05:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
requirements and the pro proliferation
 
05:22:17.708 --> 05:22:17.718 align:start position:0%
of personal electronic devices
 
05:22:19.350 --> 05:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
accessible to Children we've discussed
 
05:22:21.390 --> 05:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
that and I'm going to highlight some of
 
05:22:22.750 --> 05:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
the information on this and I'm going to
 
05:22:25.390 --> 05:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
use PornHub as a reference uh because I
 
05:22:27.110 --> 05:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
have some data on that but they they are
 
05:22:29.750 --> 05:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
no means the only the only uh purveyor
 
05:22:31.190 --> 05:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
of commercial porn that's that this
 
05:22:34.628 --> 05:22:34.638 align:start position:0%
would apply to um and I already sent
 
05:22:36.390 --> 05:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
this in as testimony to the committee
 
05:22:38.110 --> 05:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
there's quite a bit of data in here and
 
05:22:39.868 --> 05:22:39.878 align:start position:0%
there's it's all cited and all of those
 
05:22:41.070 --> 05:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
citations are in there if you want to
 
05:22:43.910 --> 05:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
look at it later so according to the
 
05:22:45.708 --> 05:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
data reported in Psychology today well
 
05:22:48.070 --> 05:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
over 90 billion videos are viewed daily
 
05:22:50.350 --> 05:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
on PornHub it's the world largest
 
05:22:53.310 --> 05:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
pornography website and more than 65 has
 
05:22:56.708 --> 05:22:56.718 align:start position:0%
more than 64 million view uh visitors
 
05:23:00.628 --> 05:23:00.638 align:start position:0%
74% that are male 26% female according
 
05:23:03.788 --> 05:23:03.798 align:start position:0%
to a May 2023 report published by uh
 
05:23:06.110 --> 05:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
Britain's children's commissioner almost
 
05:23:08.990 --> 05:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
2third of young adults uh reported that
 
05:23:10.430 --> 05:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
they have intentionally or accidentally
 
05:23:12.670 --> 05:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
viewed porn this is likely to be an
 
05:23:14.470 --> 05:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
underestimation given the embarrassing
 
05:23:17.270 --> 05:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
nature of the self-report type of data
 
05:23:18.708 --> 05:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
the average age in which children
 
05:23:20.548 --> 05:23:20.558 align:start position:0%
intentionally or accidentally view uh
 
05:23:22.990 --> 05:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
pornography is 13 with incidents much
 
05:23:25.910 --> 05:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
much lower almost half of boys who had
 
05:23:27.830 --> 05:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
reported uh intentionally in viewing it
 
05:23:30.390 --> 05:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
they also report viewing it frequently
 
05:23:32.830 --> 05:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
uh once CE or twice once or twice or
 
05:23:35.708 --> 05:23:35.718 align:start position:0%
more per week a fifth of boys who had
 
05:23:37.830 --> 05:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
intentionally viewed porn every day more
 
05:23:39.990 --> 05:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
often um a fifth of boys had
 
05:23:42.310 --> 05:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
intentionally viewed porn every day uh
 
05:23:44.190 --> 05:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
that's one of the natures of pornography
 
05:23:46.110 --> 05:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
is just like many other things it's it's
 
05:23:49.510 --> 05:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
addictive it's an addictive uh issue for
 
05:23:51.948 --> 05:23:51.958 align:start position:0%
adults it's an addictive issue
 
05:23:53.548 --> 05:23:53.558 align:start position:0%
particularly for children who don't have
 
05:23:56.070 --> 05:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
developed senses of addiction
 
05:23:58.270 --> 05:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
control and the majority of pornography
 
05:24:01.310 --> 05:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
is viewed online because it's easy
 
05:24:03.510 --> 05:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
ramifications of this are children learn
 
05:24:05.788 --> 05:24:05.798 align:start position:0%
social norms by their personal
 
05:24:07.990 --> 05:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
experiences and what they View and uh
 
05:24:09.510 --> 05:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
pornography viewing increases their
 
05:24:11.788 --> 05:24:11.798 align:start position:0%
perceptions of inaccurate sexual scripts
 
05:24:13.708 --> 05:24:13.718 align:start position:0%
which include sexual exploitation of
 
05:24:17.510 --> 05:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
others sexual violence and even rape a
 
05:24:19.110 --> 05:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
British study revealed that many young
 
05:24:21.430 --> 05:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
people Express an expectation now that
 
05:24:23.470 --> 05:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
sex involves physical
 
05:24:27.670 --> 05:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
aggression 16 to 20 one year olds uh
 
05:24:30.470 --> 05:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
surveyed reported that um the survey
 
05:24:31.548 --> 05:24:31.558 align:start position:0%
found that young people who are
 
05:24:33.868 --> 05:24:33.878 align:start position:0%
frequently exposed to pornography were
 
05:24:35.510 --> 05:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
significantly more likely to have been
 
05:24:37.548 --> 05:24:37.558 align:start position:0%
involved in a physically aggressive or
 
05:24:41.230 --> 05:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
degrading SE sex act either as the child
 
05:24:43.070 --> 05:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
who had been harmed or the person who
 
05:24:44.510 --> 05:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
did the
 
05:24:47.190 --> 05:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
harm pornography is absent of any
 
05:24:49.270 --> 05:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
emotional context that forms healthy
 
05:24:51.910 --> 05:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
adult relationships and many who view
 
05:24:53.948 --> 05:24:53.958 align:start position:0%
pornography have feelings of guilt and
 
05:24:56.110 --> 05:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
shame which further adds to the mental
 
05:24:58.830 --> 05:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
health exasperation of young people now
 
05:25:01.670 --> 05:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
this is besides the emotional and
 
05:25:03.750 --> 05:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
developmental growth of children one of
 
05:25:05.830 --> 05:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
the things to keep in mind um
 
05:25:08.708 --> 05:25:08.718 align:start position:0%
underscoring all of this is there are
 
05:25:10.470 --> 05:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
additional concerns with the operational
 
05:25:13.110 --> 05:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
model of some of these uh major porn
 
05:25:15.750 --> 05:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
sites many online pornography sites are
 
05:25:18.070 --> 05:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
built on video sharing models where
 
05:25:19.948 --> 05:25:19.958 align:start position:0%
independent developers can upload their
 
05:25:22.510 --> 05:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
content onto the site this is an issue
 
05:25:24.030 --> 05:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
because the hosting company cannot
 
05:25:25.868 --> 05:25:25.878 align:start position:0%
ensure that this is free from Child
 
05:25:28.150 --> 05:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
exploitation and human trafficking and
 
05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
this has actually been quite the issue
 
05:25:31.788 --> 05:25:31.798 align:start position:0%
lately I don't know if this is called
 
05:25:35.150 --> 05:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
Alo or ILO a yo Holdings it's a company
 
05:25:37.510 --> 05:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
formerly called mindgeek it's the parent
 
05:25:41.070 --> 05:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
company of PornHub a 2020 study found
 
05:25:43.750 --> 05:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
that nearly half of pornhub's content
 
05:25:46.270 --> 05:25:46.280 align:start position:0%
contains sexual violence and women were
 
05:25:49.590 --> 05:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
the target of this violence 97% of the
 
05:25:52.628 --> 05:25:52.638 align:start position:0%
time uh interestingly in January 2020 a
 
05:25:54.670 --> 05:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
US judge awarded damages to a group of
 
05:25:56.070 --> 05:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
women who the court had found had been
 
05:25:58.750 --> 05:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
coed and tricked into making pornography
 
05:26:01.670 --> 05:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
um by the uh by a video sharing site
 
05:26:04.390 --> 05:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
hosted on PornHub in April of 2021 a
 
05:26:05.868 --> 05:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
congressional briefing was held to
 
05:26:07.390 --> 05:26:07.400 align:start position:0%
discuss mindgeek who had been
 
05:26:09.548 --> 05:26:09.558 align:start position:0%
scrutinized for hosting videos of child
 
05:26:13.590 --> 05:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse rape and trafficking in
 
05:26:15.868 --> 05:26:15.878 align:start position:0%
June of 2021 a lawsuit was filed against
 
05:26:18.110 --> 05:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
mindgeek electing alleging that PornHub
 
05:26:20.548 --> 05:26:20.558 align:start position:0%

05:26:44.110 --> 05:26:44.120 align:start position:0%

note I'm the mother of four children I
 
05:27:01.350 --> 05:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
have two uh two daughters and two sons
 
05:27:04.350 --> 05:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
I will let you know that as a parent it
 
05:27:08.590 --> 05:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
is almost impossible to raise your child
 
05:27:11.310 --> 05:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
in a pornified society in a porn
 
05:27:14.030 --> 05:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
accessible Society no matter what you do
 
05:27:16.830 --> 05:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
as a parent you are not going to be able
 
05:27:19.948 --> 05:27:19.958 align:start position:0%
to to you're not going to be able to put
 
05:27:22.030 --> 05:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
controls on the situation where you
 
05:27:24.628 --> 05:27:24.638 align:start position:0%
actually can um limit this for your
 
05:27:27.430 --> 05:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
children it's very difficult no matter
 
05:27:30.788 --> 05:27:30.798 align:start position:0%
how many password protections algorithms
 
05:27:32.948 --> 05:27:32.958 align:start position:0%
on our child children's devices who are
 
05:27:35.230 --> 05:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
now young adults and my youngest is in
 
05:27:37.788 --> 05:27:37.798 align:start position:0%
high school um we've always had the
 
05:27:39.628 --> 05:27:39.638 align:start position:0%
controls to their phones we've always
 
05:27:43.510 --> 05:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
had those things still impossible
 
05:27:47.910 --> 05:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
um there's just it's it just cannot be
 
05:27:51.628 --> 05:27:51.638 align:start position:0%
it cannot be overstated how much parents
 
05:27:53.868 --> 05:27:53.878 align:start position:0%
even who try to do the right thing are
 
05:27:56.548 --> 05:27:56.558 align:start position:0%
having difficulty and I'll be honest
 
05:27:59.230 --> 05:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
with you our state laws are not helping
 
05:28:01.430 --> 05:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
parents we're actually we make this
 
05:28:02.628 --> 05:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
harder on
 
05:28:05.310 --> 05:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
parents um and it is honestly it's a
 
05:28:07.910 --> 05:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's a personal tra it's a real Travy
 
05:28:11.150 --> 05:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
tra sorry tragedy what an uphill parent
 
05:28:12.830 --> 05:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
what uphill battles parents have to go
 
05:28:15.470 --> 05:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
through right now now will this
 
05:28:17.070 --> 05:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
completely limit young people from
 
05:28:20.628 --> 05:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
having access to porn no no it won't
 
05:28:23.270 --> 05:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
however it is it is something we have to
 
05:28:25.590 --> 05:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
do something it is a it is a starting
 
05:28:29.070 --> 05:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
speed bump to address the fact that you
 
05:28:30.910 --> 05:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
have human sexual
 
05:28:33.788 --> 05:28:33.798 align:start position:0%
material trafficking material child rape
 
05:28:36.628 --> 05:28:36.638 align:start position:0%
material you have all of this worse it's
 
05:28:38.788 --> 05:28:38.798 align:start position:0%
this is fully accessible to adults which
 
05:28:41.150 --> 05:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
is worse enough all we're trying to do
 
05:28:42.948 --> 05:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
here is we're trying to put some a stop
 
05:28:46.030 --> 05:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
Gap measure to see if we can actually
 
05:28:47.750 --> 05:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
keep that from being accessible to
 
05:28:49.110 --> 05:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
children and as we've seen in the
 
05:28:51.590 --> 05:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
results in Louisiana there is there is
 
05:28:53.628 --> 05:28:53.638 align:start position:0%
some benefit to
 
05:28:57.190 --> 05:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
this um I would like to to say that one
 
05:28:58.830 --> 05:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
thing that this bill does it's it's just
 
05:29:00.708 --> 05:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
a way to be proactive and start I ating
 
05:29:03.510 --> 05:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
the harms uh to Youth Development and
 
05:29:05.990 --> 05:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
really to combat sexual violence overall
 
05:29:07.310 --> 05:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
if that's something that people in this
 
05:29:09.030 --> 05:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
committee you know I know you're all
 
05:29:11.590 --> 05:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
committed everyone here is committed to
 
05:29:14.430 --> 05:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
public health and safety and I know a
 
05:29:16.510 --> 05:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
lot of everyone here is committed to
 
05:29:18.110 --> 05:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
combating sexual
 
05:29:20.470 --> 05:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
violence some interesting facts some
 
05:29:22.510 --> 05:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
other states and uh countries that have
 
05:29:24.948 --> 05:29:24.958 align:start position:0%
en enacted this age verification
 
05:29:26.350 --> 05:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
interestingly what I found out when I
 
05:29:28.110 --> 05:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
started researching it it has huge
 
05:29:31.390 --> 05:29:31.400 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support and uh these laws
 
05:29:32.788 --> 05:29:32.798 align:start position:0%
have passed in a number of states to
 
05:29:34.670 --> 05:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
include Louisiana Texas Virginia
 
05:29:37.350 --> 05:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
Arkansas Mississippi and Montana in this
 
05:29:39.430 --> 05:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
year alone there there are 16 age
 
05:29:41.708 --> 05:29:41.718 align:start position:0%
verification bills in introduced across
 
05:29:44.190 --> 05:29:44.200 align:start position:0%
the US in the states who have passed
 
05:29:46.110 --> 05:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
these laws like I said it's typically
 
05:29:49.030 --> 05:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
typically bipartisan in Louisiana it
 
05:29:53.070 --> 05:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
passed 100 to zero with 30 Dems 68
 
05:29:54.948 --> 05:29:54.958 align:start position:0%
Republicans and two Independence in
 
05:29:59.430 --> 05:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
Texas it passed 135 to 5 with five de uh
 
05:30:02.430 --> 05:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
57 democ rats and 78 Republicans in
 
05:30:06.310 --> 05:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
Virginia it passed 39 to zero with 21
 
05:30:09.070 --> 05:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
Democrats and 18 Republicans
 
05:30:11.510 --> 05:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
interestingly just last month December
 
05:30:14.628 --> 05:30:14.638 align:start position:0%
2023 the European Union a block of 27
 
05:30:17.310 --> 05:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
Nations began requiring age verification
 
05:30:20.150 --> 05:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
for online porn pornography sites with
 
05:30:22.510 --> 05:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
penalty violations up to 6% of the
 
05:30:24.990 --> 05:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
company's Global revenues I'm not
 
05:30:26.590 --> 05:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting that but I'm just letting you
 
05:30:28.190 --> 05:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
know what the EU is doing this is a
 
05:30:31.708 --> 05:30:31.718 align:start position:0%
worldwide conversation and it's you know
 
05:30:33.590 --> 05:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
for lack of federal movement on this
 
05:30:35.788 --> 05:30:35.798 align:start position:0%
it's up to us in the states to act does
 
05:30:37.070 --> 05:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions for me I'm
 
05:30:39.070 --> 05:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions for this
 
05:30:40.628 --> 05:30:40.638 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Alexander
 
05:30:42.110 --> 05:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm sorry for so many
 
05:30:44.350 --> 05:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
questions I guess I'm just confused at
 
05:30:46.030 --> 05:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
what this would actually actually do
 
05:30:48.110 --> 05:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm on the liquor New
 
05:30:50.390 --> 05:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state liquor store website and
 
05:30:52.310 --> 05:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
when I log in it says You must be of
 
05:30:54.350 --> 05:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
legal age to enter this site are you
 
05:30:57.590 --> 05:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
over 21 yes or no that's all you have to
 
05:31:01.310 --> 05:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
say so if a minor wanted to go on
 
05:31:03.868 --> 05:31:03.878 align:start position:0%
PornHub all PornHub would have to do is
 
05:31:06.750 --> 05:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
say are you over the age of 18 yes or no
 
05:31:09.390 --> 05:31:09.400 align:start position:0%
no that's not what this bill says okay
 
05:31:12.070 --> 05:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
this bill because in this bill in the
 
05:31:15.390 --> 05:31:15.400 align:start position:0%
language of the bill it and it R moff
 
05:31:16.910 --> 05:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
you can correct me if I'm wrong but in
 
05:31:19.150 --> 05:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
the language of this bill it is a an
 
05:31:22.788 --> 05:31:22.798 align:start position:0%
uploading of a an ID card and it says in
 
05:31:25.350 --> 05:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
this bill that the the third party that
 
05:31:27.510 --> 05:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
is in charge of this security feature is
 
05:31:29.590 --> 05:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
not allowed to retain that ID but that's
 
05:31:32.548 --> 05:31:32.558 align:start position:0%
a partion of that I'll try to find
 
05:31:34.270 --> 05:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
exactly where it is but you know on the
 
05:31:36.948 --> 05:31:36.958 align:start position:0%
Fly I don't think I'm going to get to it
 
05:31:41.548 --> 05:31:41.558 align:start position:0%
it's on it's on uh page two uh ran
 
05:31:42.948 --> 05:31:42.958 align:start position:0%
numeral 8 I
 
05:31:45.910 --> 05:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
think okay so a user would have to
 
05:31:48.110 --> 05:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
upload a state issued driver's license
 
05:31:51.030 --> 05:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
or or access that website uh it would be
 
05:31:52.948 --> 05:31:52.958 align:start position:0%
whatever the the type of ID I think it
 
05:31:55.390 --> 05:31:55.400 align:start position:0%
just says governmen issued ID okay yeah
 
05:31:58.750 --> 05:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
and that's one there and um yes all
 
05:32:00.788 --> 05:32:00.798 align:start position:0%
right other questions for this yes
 
05:32:03.150 --> 05:32:03.160 align:start position:0%
representative D Lorenzo thank you Mr
 
05:32:04.390 --> 05:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:32:05.990 --> 05:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
question you know I'm looking at this
 
05:32:08.510 --> 05:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
bill and listening to you speak and um
 
05:32:11.390 --> 05:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
I'm getting a little bit confused um you
 
05:32:15.310 --> 05:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
know kids being um curious about
 
05:32:19.670 --> 05:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
sexuality and sex um is normal it's a
 
05:32:21.948 --> 05:32:21.958 align:start position:0%
normal right of passage um I know when I
 
05:32:24.230 --> 05:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
was growing up you know Brothers kids in
 
05:32:26.350 --> 05:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood would um look for their
 
05:32:29.070 --> 05:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
parents um Playboy magazines under the
 
05:32:31.310 --> 05:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
mattress or huster and all that stuff so
 
05:32:33.708 --> 05:32:33.718 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like a write of Passage and
 
05:32:36.390 --> 05:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing from when you speak
 
05:32:37.990 --> 05:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm what I'm hearing from you is
 
05:32:38.000 --> 05:32:41.430 align:start position:0%
what I'm what I'm hearing from you is
that

05:32:41.430 --> 05:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:44.590 --> 05:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
um a child who's exposed to um
 
05:32:46.430 --> 05:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
pornography or whatever we think of his
 
05:32:50.310 --> 05:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
pornography is subject to become
 
05:32:55.030 --> 05:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
dependent on it um it's almost like I'm
 
05:32:56.510 --> 05:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
thinking just because your kid looks at
 
05:32:57.548 --> 05:32:57.558 align:start position:0%
porn it doesn't mean that they're going
 
05:33:00.310 --> 05:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
to grow up into being Ted Bundy and
 
05:33:02.030 --> 05:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's the sort of panic that I'm that
 
05:33:05.430 --> 05:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing and feeling here um sure do
 
05:33:08.190 --> 05:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
you want me to answer to that well yeah
 
05:33:11.830 --> 05:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
sure okay so you know and and perhaps
 
05:33:13.670 --> 05:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's there's a plenty of data out
 
05:33:14.830 --> 05:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
there that you can look at you can
 
05:33:17.590 --> 05:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
easily you can easily uh look up some of
 
05:33:19.750 --> 05:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
these things but the unfortunately the
 
05:33:22.150 --> 05:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
really addictive nature of pornography
 
05:33:24.190 --> 05:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
is it's you know it and this is I'll
 
05:33:25.628 --> 05:33:25.638 align:start position:0%
honest with this is the talk I gave to
 
05:33:28.190 --> 05:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
my boys it starts off by looking at cute
 
05:33:30.390 --> 05:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
cheerleaders online and and then it gets
 
05:33:31.750 --> 05:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
a little graphic and then looking at
 
05:33:33.510 --> 05:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
cute cheerleaders isn't enough now you
 
05:33:35.548 --> 05:33:35.558 align:start position:0%
got to look at naked cute cheerleaders
 
05:33:36.910 --> 05:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden that becomes
 
05:33:39.230 --> 05:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
not enough because every at every level
 
05:33:41.390 --> 05:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
you get desensitized to what you're
 
05:33:43.548 --> 05:33:43.558 align:start position:0%
seeing and the only re and then you have
 
05:33:45.910 --> 05:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
to go and seek out harder and harder
 
05:33:51.390 --> 05:33:51.400 align:start position:0%
corn uh por uh porn uh images video
 
05:33:53.948 --> 05:33:53.958 align:start position:0%
whatever there's there's a negative
 
05:33:56.270 --> 05:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
progression that happens regularly and
 
05:33:59.270 --> 05:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
the problem that we have is that sure
 
05:34:02.990 --> 05:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
maybe you know 1980 where all you have
 
05:34:08.590 --> 05:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
to choose from is is Playboy there is a
 
05:34:14.470 --> 05:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
deep deep dark hole of really awful
 
05:34:18.270 --> 05:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
content and that is propagated online to
 
05:34:20.310 --> 05:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
be honest with you and another thing
 
05:34:23.310 --> 05:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
that is also very concerning is that
 
05:34:25.030 --> 05:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's very widely understood that
 
05:34:27.510 --> 05:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
pornography exposure is used as a
 
05:34:30.628 --> 05:34:30.638 align:start position:0%
deliberate strategy to groom children
 
05:34:33.310 --> 05:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
because it constantly desensitizes them
 
05:34:36.750 --> 05:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
to aberant sexual content so we have
 
05:34:39.470 --> 05:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
taken something that human sexuality and
 
05:34:42.350 --> 05:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
we have inverted it to a a point where
 
05:34:46.590 --> 05:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
it's we are this the stuff that children
 
05:34:48.628 --> 05:34:48.638 align:start position:0%
can see the honestly the stuff that
 
05:34:51.430 --> 05:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
adults can see it's it's really just
 
05:34:53.310 --> 05:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
beyond that what everyone could have
 
05:34:57.150 --> 05:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
even imagined from 1980 to now does that
 
05:34:59.990 --> 05:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
answer your question or does that answer
 
05:35:02.510 --> 05:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
you're did you did I touch upon the
 
05:35:03.910 --> 05:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
thing that you wanted to that you had
 
05:35:07.350 --> 05:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
made a statement about no not at all and
 
05:35:10.708 --> 05:35:10.718 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of State of Mind of the
 
05:35:14.190 --> 05:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
person who's U you know like addicted to
 
05:35:14.200 --> 05:35:15.910 align:start position:0%
person who's U you know like addicted to
pornography

05:35:15.910 --> 05:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
pornography
 
05:35:18.310 --> 05:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
um I would kind of think that they're
 
05:35:21.270 --> 05:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
probably not normal um and I don't think
 
05:35:23.030 --> 05:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
you can turn I don't think you can turn
 
05:35:26.230 --> 05:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
a normal kid into an a normal kid
 
05:35:28.788 --> 05:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
because they've they've um seen
 
05:35:31.150 --> 05:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
pornography so there has to be some sort
 
05:35:33.910 --> 05:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
of a mental lapse there or mental issue
 
05:35:35.830 --> 05:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
there I think well what you and I are
 
05:35:37.788 --> 05:35:37.798 align:start position:0%
doing right now is having a conversation
 
05:35:40.310 --> 05:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
we're not really I mean I'm I'm showing
 
05:35:43.150 --> 05:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
you right here PornHub has 64 million
 
05:35:47.910 --> 05:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
views viewers so you know don't take my
 
05:35:49.990 --> 05:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
word for it go look at go look at the
 
05:35:52.868 --> 05:35:52.878 align:start position:0%
net profit of porn across in the us
 
05:35:55.628 --> 05:35:55.638 align:start position:0%
alone the net profit of porn is
 
05:35:59.750 --> 05:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
astronomical so if if there is not a a
 
05:36:01.230 --> 05:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
addictive nature that there's plenty of
 
05:36:04.390 --> 05:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
people that are I would guess viewing
 
05:36:07.150 --> 05:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
porn that you would have no idea um it's
 
05:36:09.830 --> 05:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
highly it's a high big business to be
 
05:36:11.510 --> 05:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
honest with you
 
05:36:14.150 --> 05:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
so lot of repeat
 
05:36:17.110 --> 05:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
customers yes representative G thank you
 
05:36:19.548 --> 05:36:19.558 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you uh for your
 
05:36:22.390 --> 05:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
testimony do you have any statistics
 
05:36:24.750 --> 05:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
within your information about the number
 
05:36:28.868 --> 05:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
of convicted child molesters and or
 
05:36:32.390 --> 05:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
rapists and or other sexual
 
05:36:34.628 --> 05:36:34.638 align:start position:0%
predators uh
 
05:36:39.390 --> 05:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
who became addicted to pornography where
 
05:36:42.868 --> 05:36:42.878 align:start position:0%
or where the use of pornography was
 
05:36:46.070 --> 05:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
prevalent in their lives prior to their
 
05:36:49.310 --> 05:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
Commission of a sexual crime I don't
 
05:36:52.948 --> 05:36:52.958 align:start position:0%
have any specific uh stats on that um
 
05:36:55.670 --> 05:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
like I had just touched upon you
 
05:36:58.548 --> 05:36:58.558 align:start position:0%
know pornography exposure obviously is
 
05:37:01.150 --> 05:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
is often used as deliberate strategy to
 
05:37:04.830 --> 05:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
groom children and and that is that is
 
05:37:08.230 --> 05:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
obviously a big concern but as far as
 
05:37:10.150 --> 05:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
that goes I don't but there's quite a
 
05:37:12.750 --> 05:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
bit of data out there on mindgeek and
 
05:37:15.110 --> 05:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
the legal troubles that they have had
 
05:37:16.750 --> 05:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know if that's why they
 
05:37:18.670 --> 05:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
changed their name to Alo Holdings to be
 
05:37:19.628 --> 05:37:19.638 align:start position:0%
honest with you because they've had a
 
05:37:21.868 --> 05:37:21.878 align:start position:0%
couple different names but there is
 
05:37:23.868 --> 05:37:23.878 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of undercover reporting
 
05:37:25.788 --> 05:37:25.798 align:start position:0%
that's been done on mindgeek where
 
05:37:27.430 --> 05:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
people from mindgeek themselves have
 
05:37:29.590 --> 05:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
fully admit that they can't keep child
 
05:37:32.708 --> 05:37:32.718 align:start position:0%
child rape human trafficking sexual
 
05:37:35.270 --> 05:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
violence and other things that are
 
05:37:39.948 --> 05:37:39.958 align:start position:0%
highly illegal off their site um so that
 
05:37:42.150 --> 05:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily answer what you had
 
05:37:44.310 --> 05:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
but but there is a a huge legal
 
05:37:45.548 --> 05:37:45.558 align:start position:0%
component to what's going on with
 
05:37:48.830 --> 05:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
mindgeek for the last four to five
 
05:37:51.788 --> 05:37:51.798 align:start position:0%
years other questions for this witness
 
05:37:53.548 --> 05:37:53.558 align:start position:0%
so you know I want to just follow up as
 
05:37:55.990 --> 05:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of thinking about this um
 
05:37:58.230 --> 05:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
follow up on a question I asked of Prior
 
05:38:01.830 --> 05:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
witness so um the representative King I
 
05:38:03.470 --> 05:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
believe said that he was that was not
 
05:38:05.910 --> 05:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill in the in
 
05:38:05.920 --> 05:38:07.070 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill in the in
representative

05:38:07.070 --> 05:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:38:09.510 --> 05:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
Alexander's uh example of the you know
 
05:38:12.230 --> 05:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
the mom restaurant was not the it was
 
05:38:15.628 --> 05:38:15.638 align:start position:0%
not the uh uh purpose of this bill to
 
05:38:18.150 --> 05:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
capture the restaurant or put some
 
05:38:21.190 --> 05:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
burden on the restaurant to police what
 
05:38:22.868 --> 05:38:22.878 align:start position:0%
you know if they have Wi-Fi access what
 
05:38:26.310 --> 05:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
goes on in the Wi-Fi access my NE my my
 
05:38:28.510 --> 05:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
next question though is what
 
05:38:32.830 --> 05:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
about suppose I'm I'm I
 
05:38:35.590 --> 05:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
run uh an internet service in other
 
05:38:39.390 --> 05:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
words suppose I'm Microsoft or or
 
05:38:41.270 --> 05:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
Facebook or whatever I maybe Facebook's
 
05:38:44.190 --> 05:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
a bad but suppose I'm Microsoft and I
 
05:38:47.350 --> 05:38:47.360 align:start position:0%
provide internet service you know all
 
05:38:50.628 --> 05:38:50.638 align:start position:0%
over the place for around the world um
 
05:38:54.230 --> 05:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
and one of the one of the people that uh
 
05:38:57.110 --> 05:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
one of the businesses that uses my
 
05:39:00.190 --> 05:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
Microsoft Internet service is
 
05:39:03.910 --> 05:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
PornHub so is it the purpose of does
 
05:39:06.548 --> 05:39:06.558 align:start position:0%
this bill capture Microsoft in my
 
05:39:09.548 --> 05:39:09.558 align:start position:0%
example or is it only or is it only
 
05:39:13.590 --> 05:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
PornHub as I read the bill yeah it is it
 
05:39:16.430 --> 05:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
refers specifically the intent is about
 
05:39:19.150 --> 05:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
commercial entities that are Publishers
 
05:39:21.390 --> 05:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
of porn that's their business
 
05:39:24.270 --> 05:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
Microsoft's business isn't porn but a
 
05:39:27.030 --> 05:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
porn company's business is porn so well
 
05:39:28.708 --> 05:39:28.718 align:start position:0%
except that I mean under the under the
 
05:39:30.910 --> 05:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
law could would they be considered to be
 
05:39:35.110 --> 05:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
because because Microsoft passes
 
05:39:38.468 --> 05:39:38.478 align:start position:0%
on the the
 
05:39:41.510 --> 05:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know what PornHub Microsoft
 
05:39:44.948 --> 05:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
passes on to me for example if if I if I
 
05:39:48.190 --> 05:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
have a computer and I plug into PornHub
 
05:39:52.430 --> 05:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
Microsoft passes on to me from PornHub
 
05:39:55.070 --> 05:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
what's on on PornHub so in some sense
 
05:39:56.670 --> 05:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
they could be considered a publisher
 
05:40:00.070 --> 05:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
could they not well I mean these these
 
05:40:02.070 --> 05:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
technicalities can be ironed out in
 
05:40:03.868 --> 05:40:03.878 align:start position:0%
language and legislation which I'm I'm
 
05:40:05.948 --> 05:40:05.958 align:start position:0%
sure you all are very capable of doing
 
05:40:07.390 --> 05:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
and so some of these I'll call it the
 
05:40:09.468 --> 05:40:09.478 align:start position:0%
restaurant dilemma where we could we
 
05:40:12.230 --> 05:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
could sort of we talk about the sort of
 
05:40:14.030 --> 05:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
the well what if this and these are all
 
05:40:16.628 --> 05:40:16.638 align:start position:0%
good things but that that can be kind of
 
05:40:19.548 --> 05:40:19.558 align:start position:0%
dealt with within legislation okay so no
 
05:40:21.190 --> 05:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
no no I I don't disagree I guess what I
 
05:40:23.708 --> 05:40:23.718 align:start position:0%
want to make sure is your intent is not
 
05:40:27.030 --> 05:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
to capture Microsoft in my example the
 
05:40:29.190 --> 05:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is as it's written
 
05:40:31.708 --> 05:40:31.718 align:start position:0%
by by uh Rhett Moffet and uh the
 
05:40:33.350 --> 05:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors is that any commercial
 
05:40:35.110 --> 05:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
entity that knowingly or intentionally
 
05:40:38.110 --> 05:40:38.120 align:start position:0%
publishes or distributes uh material
 
05:40:39.548 --> 05:40:39.558 align:start position:0%
potentially harmful Myers on the
 
05:40:42.110 --> 05:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
internet from a website that contains a
 
05:40:44.070 --> 05:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
substantial portion of such material
 
05:40:47.430 --> 05:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
shall be head Li shall be held liable so
 
05:40:51.468 --> 05:40:51.478 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's saying here from sites to
 
05:40:53.708 --> 05:40:53.718 align:start position:0%
which that is their that's their ma
 
05:40:56.110 --> 05:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
majority portion of their content okay
 
05:40:58.190 --> 05:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
so you all right so you would say that
 
05:40:59.910 --> 05:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
in in the example you would say
 
05:41:02.548 --> 05:41:02.558 align:start position:0%
Microsoft is off the hook here because
 
05:41:05.788 --> 05:41:05.798 align:start position:0%
Microsoft it's not a third of their of
 
05:41:08.190 --> 05:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
their activity is not is not pornh hubs
 
05:41:09.628 --> 05:41:09.638 align:start position:0%
well that's not the their substantial

amount of their business that's not
 
05:41:13.110 --> 05:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
their purpose of their business just
 
05:41:14.830 --> 05:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
like the libraries off the hook the
 
05:41:16.670 --> 05:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
restaurants off the hook the coffee
 
05:41:19.150 --> 05:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
shops off the hook the state house um
 
05:41:20.868 --> 05:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
lobbies off the hook okay you know that
 
05:41:22.830 --> 05:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
kind of a thing that offers that and I
 
05:41:24.548 --> 05:41:24.558 align:start position:0%
will say one thing is really interesting
 
05:41:26.948 --> 05:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
is when I was looking at this um and
 
05:41:28.510 --> 05:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
looking at what are some of the you know
 
05:41:29.628 --> 05:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
what are some of the resist resistance
 
05:41:32.070 --> 05:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
to legislation like this and it you know
 
05:41:33.510 --> 05:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
when when you look at some of the cases
 
05:41:34.990 --> 05:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
that have come up
 
05:41:37.948 --> 05:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
because because the Texas laws challenge
 
05:41:39.990 --> 05:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
things like that it always comes down to
 
05:41:42.230 --> 05:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
First Amendment you know it it never
 
05:41:44.110 --> 05:41:44.120 align:start position:0%
comes down to well it's the you know
 
05:41:45.430 --> 05:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
they're trying
 
05:41:48.708 --> 05:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
to unintentionally in snare a an
 
05:41:50.548 --> 05:41:50.558 align:start position:0%
internet provider you know or something
 
05:41:53.310 --> 05:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
like that so the even in other states
 
05:41:55.430 --> 05:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
that argument really isn't even being
 
05:41:58.468 --> 05:41:58.478 align:start position:0%
made by people who are actively pushing
 
05:42:00.350 --> 05:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
back against this legislation and by
 
05:42:02.910 --> 05:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
people I mean PornHub okay all right

specialist at the Coalition this
 
05:43:26.868 --> 05:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
legislation is aligned with our

Statewide violence prevention efforts
 
05:43:31.750 --> 05:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the impact of pornography
 
05:43:33.628 --> 05:43:33.638 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire youth has become a
 
05:43:35.468 --> 05:43:35.478 align:start position:0%
significant challenge in our
 
05:43:36.868 --> 05:43:36.878 align:start position:0%
community-based sexual violence
 
05:43:39.070 --> 05:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
prevention and healthy relationship
 
05:43:41.350 --> 05:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
education schools throughout the state
 
05:43:43.350 --> 05:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
have requested prevention programming in
 
05:43:45.270 --> 05:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
response to concerning and harmful
 
05:43:47.590 --> 05:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
Behavior they've seen as a result of
 
05:43:50.350 --> 05:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
students viewing pornographic material
 
05:43:53.510 --> 05:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
online to be clear today's pornography
 
05:43:56.150 --> 05:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
normalizes sexual violence when teens
 
05:43:58.350 --> 05:43:58.360 align:start position:0%
view pornography they often struggle to
 
05:44:00.190 --> 05:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
differentiate what they're viewing from
 
05:44:02.708 --> 05:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
reality and it is formative in creating
 
05:44:04.788 --> 05:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
ideas of sex and relationships that
 
05:44:06.590 --> 05:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
directly contradict what we teach about
 
05:44:09.190 --> 05:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
healthy relationships and consent as
 
05:44:12.350 --> 05:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
part of our sexual violence prevention
 
05:44:14.510 --> 05:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
initiatives our work is informed on
 
05:44:17.190 --> 05:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
healthy stages of childhood development
 
05:44:19.110 --> 05:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
we know that the prefrontal cortex plays
 
05:44:21.310 --> 05:44:21.320 align:start position:0%
a key role in regulating thoughts
 
05:44:22.510 --> 05:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
actions and
 
05:44:24.708 --> 05:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
emotions for minors this part of the
 
05:44:26.990 --> 05:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
brain is not yet fully developed and
 
05:44:28.510 --> 05:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
that can create challenges in their
 
05:44:30.948 --> 05:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
ability to conceptualize the fact that
 
05:44:33.910 --> 05:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
in most pornographic videos the consent
 
05:44:35.628 --> 05:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
is only being given off
 
05:44:38.628 --> 05:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
camera it's an unfortunate reality that
 
05:44:40.150 --> 05:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
many teens in the granite state are
 
05:44:42.150 --> 05:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
looking to pornography as a way to learn
 
05:44:44.310 --> 05:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
about sex which is giving them all the
 
05:44:45.670 --> 05:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
wrong answers about healthy
 
05:44:49.150 --> 05:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
relationships and consent in the 2021
 
05:44:51.788 --> 05:44:51.798 align:start position:0%
youth risk behavior survey 11% of
 
05:44:53.868 --> 05:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
students reported experiencing sexual
 
05:44:55.948 --> 05:44:55.958 align:start position:0%
violence this mirrors is what we know
 
05:44:57.468 --> 05:44:57.478 align:start position:0%
about the reality of sexual assault in
 
05:44:59.430 --> 05:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:45:01.030 --> 05:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
we can only expect this number to
 
05:45:02.830 --> 05:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
decrease if we ensure that students
 
05:45:04.270 --> 05:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
receive age appropriate and
 
05:45:06.510 --> 05:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed information about
 
05:45:09.190 --> 05:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
healthy relationships the messages youth
 
05:45:11.150 --> 05:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
get from pornography contradict what we
 
05:45:12.948 --> 05:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
are focused on in our sexual violence
 
05:45:16.150 --> 05:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
prevention programming House Bill 1256
 
05:45:18.070 --> 05:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
will create important safeguards to
 
05:45:19.910 --> 05:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
block minors from accessing pornography
 
05:45:21.868 --> 05:45:21.878 align:start position:0%
online while this bill will not
 
05:45:23.910 --> 05:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate sexual violence in our state
 
05:45:26.150 --> 05:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
it is a step in the right direction to
 
05:45:27.708 --> 05:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
prevent miners from being exposed to
 
05:45:30.030 --> 05:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
harmful content
 
05:45:31.830 --> 05:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
we hope you consider supporting this
 
05:45:34.548 --> 05:45:34.558 align:start position:0%
legislation today and we thank you for
 
05:45:36.270 --> 05:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
helping protect New Hampshire children
 
05:45:38.628 --> 05:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to answer any questions
 
05:45:40.990 --> 05:45:41.000 align:start position:0%

05:46:24.350 --> 05:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:46:25.708 --> 05:46:25.718 align:start position:0%
committee jel biset I'm the legal
 
05:46:29.390 --> 05:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
director of the ACLU of New Hampshire um
 
05:46:31.150 --> 05:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that we have First
 
05:46:34.030 --> 05:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment concerns with um I can just
 
05:46:37.510 --> 05:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
tell you that um as was mentioned before
 
05:46:38.750 --> 05:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
there have been seven states that have
 
05:46:41.190 --> 05:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
enacted similar laws Arkansas Montana
 
05:46:43.350 --> 05:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
Mississippi Louisiana Utah Virginia and
 
05:46:46.150 --> 05:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
Texas these are pretty new laws um that
 
05:46:48.310 --> 05:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
have started kind of coming into place
 
05:46:50.510 --> 05:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
um over the the past couple years and
 
05:46:53.190 --> 05:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
there have been uh three pieces of
 
05:46:56.390 --> 05:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
litigation um um arising out of Texas
 
05:46:58.390 --> 05:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
Louisiana and Utah my understanding is
 
05:47:02.390 --> 05:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
the Louisiana and Utah cases uh were uh
 
05:47:04.468 --> 05:47:04.478 align:start position:0%
dismissed on the basis that there was an
 
05:47:06.310 --> 05:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
inability of the plaintiffs to bring a
 
05:47:08.430 --> 05:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
pre-enforcement challenge so I I don't
 
05:47:10.788 --> 05:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not uh I don't understand those
 
05:47:12.390 --> 05:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
decisions to have addressed the First
 
05:47:15.190 --> 05:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment implications um of these types
 
05:47:17.948 --> 05:47:17.958 align:start position:0%
of laws the Texas law uh there was a
 
05:47:19.948 --> 05:47:19.958 align:start position:0%
preliminary injunction issued on First
 
05:47:22.590 --> 05:47:22.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment grounds that injunction was
 
05:47:25.350 --> 05:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately uh stayed by by the fifth
 
05:47:28.110 --> 05:47:28.120 align:start position:0%
circuit but that Texas decision um is I
 
05:47:29.708 --> 05:47:29.718 align:start position:0%
think the
 
05:47:32.468 --> 05:47:32.478 align:start position:0%
um most recent kind of indication that
 
05:47:34.708 --> 05:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
we have at least where one Court um has
 
05:47:36.350 --> 05:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
gone in in evaluating the
 
05:47:38.510 --> 05:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
constitutionality so you know this is a
 
05:47:40.430 --> 05:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
really kind of new type of legislation
 
05:47:42.310 --> 05:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
and the courts are still processing it
 
05:47:44.030 --> 05:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I can articulate some of those first
 
05:47:45.510 --> 05:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
amendment concerns but I think my
 
05:47:47.750 --> 05:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
general kind of feedback is it really
 
05:47:50.910 --> 05:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
just may make sense to wait to see how
 
05:47:52.990 --> 05:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
those uh pieces of litigation get
 
05:47:54.948 --> 05:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
handled by the district courts and then
 
05:47:57.830 --> 05:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately by the circuit courts um
 
05:47:59.270 --> 05:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
because there are legitimate First
 
05:48:00.548 --> 05:48:00.558 align:start position:0%
Amendment issues that I just want to
 
05:48:02.708 --> 05:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
walk the committee through and I think
 
05:48:05.030 --> 05:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
just the under the overarching principle
 
05:48:06.468 --> 05:48:06.478 align:start position:0%
um that I just want to kind of make
 
05:48:10.390 --> 05:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
clear is that non-obscene adult content
 
05:48:13.270 --> 05:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
is First Amendment protected speech and
 
05:48:15.070 --> 05:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
even if it is harmful to Miners and
 
05:48:17.990 --> 05:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
meets the standard as to miners right
 
05:48:19.628 --> 05:48:19.638 align:start position:0%
which is articulated in the Ginsburg
 
05:48:23.150 --> 05:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
case it still is can be protected as to
 
05:48:25.190 --> 05:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
adults so I just want to be kind of very
 
05:48:26.590 --> 05:48:26.600 align:start position:0%
clear about that that this can
 
05:48:30.230 --> 05:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately impact um Pro protected
 
05:48:32.548 --> 05:48:32.558 align:start position:0%
content under the First Amendment as to
 
05:48:34.310 --> 05:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
adults because the bread of this law
 
05:48:36.510 --> 05:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
would impact adults and I think that
 
05:48:38.910 --> 05:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
underlies the First Amendment concerns
 
05:48:40.468 --> 05:48:40.478 align:start position:0%
that we and other organizations have
 
05:48:42.070 --> 05:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
raised and ultimately the concerns that
 
05:48:45.270 --> 05:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
that Texas Court um evaluated and um
 
05:48:47.150 --> 05:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
that that Texas decision is is on
 
05:48:50.590 --> 05:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
footnote one um of our um our written
 
05:48:52.270 --> 05:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
testimony and so how does this
 
05:48:55.468 --> 05:48:55.478 align:start position:0%
ultimately impact adults because I think
 
05:48:56.948 --> 05:48:56.958 align:start position:0%
that is where the key First Amendment
 
05:48:59.390 --> 05:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
issue lies uh in our view this would
 
05:49:02.350 --> 05:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
burden uh uh Speech rights of all users
 
05:49:05.310 --> 05:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
who seek to access regulated sites and
 
05:49:07.910 --> 05:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
it would uh ultimately deprive them of
 
05:49:10.788 --> 05:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
anonymity um and in chill privacy and
 
05:49:12.590 --> 05:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
security-minded people from accessing
 
05:49:14.070 --> 05:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
sites that they have a constitutional
 
05:49:17.868 --> 05:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
right to access right as adults and so
 
05:49:20.190 --> 05:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
if allowed to go into effect our view is
 
05:49:21.990 --> 05:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
that this bill will require all internet
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
users including adults to provide
 
05:49:25.628 --> 05:49:25.638 align:start position:0%
personal information right that section
 
05:49:27.070 --> 05:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
eight that was mentioned before you have
 
05:49:29.750 --> 05:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
to present you know a government issued
 
05:49:32.868 --> 05:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
ID potentially or a a digital ID that's
 
05:49:34.708 --> 05:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
like a real thing right a real real
 
05:49:36.868 --> 05:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
burden you present that online a company
 
05:49:38.788 --> 05:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
now has access to that I understand that
 
05:49:40.390 --> 05:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
there are parameters in this bill to try
 
05:49:42.750 --> 05:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
to you know deter misuse of that
 
05:49:45.590 --> 05:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
information but it is still a burden and
 
05:49:47.510 --> 05:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
a hurdle that will undoubtedly chill
 
05:49:49.590 --> 05:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
some people from engaging in their
 
05:49:52.230 --> 05:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected rights here
 
05:49:53.990 --> 05:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I know that there was some testimony
 
05:49:55.750 --> 05:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
before about Louisiana and how after
 
05:49:57.548 --> 05:49:57.558 align:start position:0%
Louisiana enacted their law there's been
 
05:50:00.350 --> 05:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
an 80% increase I would submit that that
 
05:50:02.350 --> 05:50:02.360 align:start position:0%
probably is evidence of chill right
 
05:50:03.948 --> 05:50:03.958 align:start position:0%
because I don't think I I'm very
 
05:50:06.150 --> 05:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
skeptical that it's 80% of individuals
 
05:50:08.230 --> 05:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
in Louisiana who are all minors right
 
05:50:09.948 --> 05:50:09.958 align:start position:0%
who now don't have access I think that
 
05:50:11.430 --> 05:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
what that probably indicates is that a
 
05:50:13.350 --> 05:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
significant number of those individuals
 
05:50:15.910 --> 05:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
are adults who just decided to not
 
05:50:17.948 --> 05:50:17.958 align:start position:0%
access that information you know rightly
 
05:50:19.750 --> 05:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
or wrongly people have that choice but
 
05:50:21.910 --> 05:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
the concern that um some Advocates have
 
05:50:25.070 --> 05:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
raised including the ACLU is that um
 
05:50:27.150 --> 05:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
that really is evidence of of the chill
 
05:50:29.310 --> 05:50:29.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day with respect to um
 
05:50:31.510 --> 05:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
some of this these types of laws so I
 
05:50:33.990 --> 05:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
think ultimately I think the the speech
 
05:50:35.750 --> 05:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
concerns are real they're they're
 
05:50:37.270 --> 05:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
articulated in that preliminary
 
05:50:40.708 --> 05:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
injunction decision in Texas um that we
 
05:50:42.350 --> 05:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
quote in our written testimony but I
 
05:50:44.548 --> 05:50:44.558 align:start position:0%
think my recommendation would be to
 
05:50:46.628 --> 05:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
maybe wait to see how those cases uh
 
05:50:48.190 --> 05:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
sort themselves out uh but I would
 
05:50:49.708 --> 05:50:49.718 align:start position:0%
encourage folks to read that decision
 
05:50:52.230 --> 05:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
because I think it it it it articulates
 
05:50:54.390 --> 05:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
many of the concerns we have there is a
 
05:50:55.788 --> 05:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
difference a material difference I do
 
05:50:57.390 --> 05:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
want to flag between this law and the
 
05:50:59.510 --> 05:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
Texas law the Texas law also had a
 
05:51:01.628 --> 05:51:01.638 align:start position:0%
series of disclaimers that were required
 
05:51:03.510 --> 05:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
with respect to to pornography we don't
 
05:51:05.350 --> 05:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
we don't have that um but I think the
 
05:51:08.670 --> 05:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
other portions of the Texas uh decision
 
05:51:11.590 --> 05:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
um apply with the same Force to the the
 
05:51:13.468 --> 05:51:13.478 align:start position:0%
bill that's before this committee all
 
05:51:15.910 --> 05:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
right thank you yes representative test
 
05:51:19.868 --> 05:51:19.878 align:start position:0%
question so as as I understand it the
 
05:51:23.990 --> 05:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
ACLU believes that uh child
 
05:51:27.430 --> 05:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
pornography uh should not be regulated
 
05:51:29.468 --> 05:51:29.478 align:start position:0%
is that true
 
05:51:30.868 --> 05:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
I can just tell you the position of the
 
05:51:33.910 --> 05:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
ACLU is we need to beware of
 
05:51:35.830 --> 05:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
restrictions that in an over Brad
 
05:51:38.230 --> 05:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
fashion Encompass protected speech that
 
05:51:41.070 --> 05:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
is our position and I think that is what
 
05:51:43.350 --> 05:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
this bill would do at the end of the day
 
05:51:49.750 --> 05:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
follow up yes so uh do you have a in
 
05:51:53.670 --> 05:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
your mind some sort of a law that could
 
05:51:57.628 --> 05:51:57.638 align:start position:0%
be used to pre prevent child pornography
 
05:51:59.270 --> 05:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
I I don't know I mean I could tell you
 
05:52:00.708 --> 05:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
when you look at the cases when you go
 
05:52:03.590 --> 05:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
back to ACLU versus Reno in 1997 one of
 
05:52:05.590 --> 05:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
the things that that Court talked about
 
05:52:08.868 --> 05:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
as a more narly tailored or a lesser
 
05:52:11.190 --> 05:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
restrictive alternative right is just
 
05:52:15.270 --> 05:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
the um the importance and usage of of
 
05:52:16.990 --> 05:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
filters right and we now all have that
 
05:52:18.590 --> 05:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
on our phones is that something that
 
05:52:20.948 --> 05:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
parents can use on an individualized
 
05:52:23.750 --> 05:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
basis with their families and I think
 
05:52:26.110 --> 05:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
what this law does that is a little bit
 
05:52:27.788 --> 05:52:27.798 align:start position:0%
different and Justice Scalia I think is
 
05:52:30.310 --> 05:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
kind of talked a little bit about this
 
05:52:33.510 --> 05:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
um is that this law these types of laws
 
05:52:35.830 --> 05:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
they don't enforce parental authority
 
05:52:38.548 --> 05:52:38.558 align:start position:0%
over children's speech they impose
 
05:52:40.628 --> 05:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
government Authority subject only to a
 
05:52:42.390 --> 05:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
parental veto and I think that is kind
 
05:52:45.350 --> 05:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
of the general libertarian concern with
 
05:52:48.030 --> 05:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
um these types of these types of
 
05:52:51.788 --> 05:52:51.798 align:start position:0%
statutes yes just one one last question
 
05:52:55.070 --> 05:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
so from your perspective there really
 
05:52:58.788 --> 05:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be any limits uh you you can
 
05:53:02.670 --> 05:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
talk about all these but you basically
 
05:53:07.230 --> 05:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
have some way to turn around and prevent
 
05:53:11.670 --> 05:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
or to object to any of these kind of
 
05:53:14.390 --> 05:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
Liberties well again I I can only just
 
05:53:16.708 --> 05:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
rearticulate my position and which is I
 
05:53:18.468 --> 05:53:18.478 align:start position:0%
think consistent where the Texas Court
 
05:53:20.670 --> 05:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
came out which is that when you have a
 
05:53:23.548 --> 05:53:23.558 align:start position:0%
regulation that deals with speech rights
 
05:53:25.788 --> 05:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
which this does including protected
 
05:53:27.788 --> 05:53:27.798 align:start position:0%
speech rights that adults haven't have a
 
05:53:30.190 --> 05:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
con tional right to access and consume
 
05:53:32.628 --> 05:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
you need to be very careful and more
 
05:53:34.350 --> 05:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
tailored than you need to be in other
 
05:53:36.990 --> 05:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
areas of the law given the the real
 
05:53:39.230 --> 05:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
importance of the First Amendment so
 
05:53:40.910 --> 05:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
that's just why I'm here is to
 
05:53:42.788 --> 05:53:42.798 align:start position:0%
articulate that there could be some
 
05:53:45.030 --> 05:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
tailoring concerns here in so far as
 
05:53:47.750 --> 05:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
this impacts protected speech which is
 
05:53:49.590 --> 05:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
where you know one District Court kind
 
05:53:52.070 --> 05:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
of landed at the preliminary injunction
 
05:53:54.510 --> 05:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
stage other questions for this word yes
 
05:53:54.520 --> 05:53:55.788 align:start position:0%
stage other questions for this word yes
representative

05:53:55.788 --> 05:53:55.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:53:58.990 --> 05:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
grion in order to reset the phone number
 
05:54:01.230 --> 05:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
on my Robin Hood account they want me to
 
05:54:04.510 --> 05:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
upload a picture of my government issued
 
05:54:08.110 --> 05:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
ID in order to do some uh various
 
05:54:09.910 --> 05:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
different things on on my Facebook
 
05:54:11.948 --> 05:54:11.958 align:start position:0%
account they wanted me to upload an
 
05:54:15.510 --> 05:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
image of my governmen issued ID when I
 
05:54:17.910 --> 05:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
go and well I don't but if if I wanted
 
05:54:20.510 --> 05:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
to go to the liquor store and get some
 
05:54:22.830 --> 05:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
alcohol I have to show my governmen
 
05:54:25.230 --> 05:54:25.240 align:start position:0%
issued ID if I want to check into a
 
05:54:27.070 --> 05:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
motel I have to provide a government
 
05:54:30.468 --> 05:54:30.478 align:start position:0%
issued ID I'm 52 years old I'm well over
 
05:54:33.150 --> 05:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
the age of of of consent for all of
 
05:54:33.160 --> 05:54:34.788 align:start position:0%
the age of of of consent for all of
these

05:54:34.788 --> 05:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:54:39.150 --> 05:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
things why is it an issue to provide a
 
05:54:42.750 --> 05:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
some form of government issued ID to
 
05:54:42.760 --> 05:54:44.150 align:start position:0%
some form of government issued ID to
access

05:54:44.150 --> 05:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
access
 
05:54:46.230 --> 05:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
pornography the difference here is
 
05:54:47.830 --> 05:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with a potential
 
05:54:51.510 --> 05:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
government mandate right uh with respect
 
05:54:54.670 --> 05:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
to how one can access speech and I think
 
05:54:56.150 --> 05:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
that is the concern at the end of the
 
05:54:57.430 --> 05:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
day and where I think this is
 
05:54:57.440 --> 05:54:58.510 align:start position:0%
day and where I think this is
distinguisher

05:54:58.510 --> 05:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
distinguisher
 
05:55:00.868 --> 05:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
from say going to a liquor store and
 
05:55:03.310 --> 05:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
presenting an ID here is that the fear
 
05:55:06.430 --> 05:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
and consequences of data misuse from
 
05:55:08.590 --> 05:55:08.600 align:start position:0%
uploading an ID to a website for the
 
05:55:11.230 --> 05:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
purpose of engaging and consuming speech
 
05:55:13.830 --> 05:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
I think is enough to scare away users
 
05:55:15.830 --> 05:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
from accessing their constitutional
 
05:55:18.350 --> 05:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
right to uh information and so I think
 
05:55:20.030 --> 05:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
that is the concern at the end of the
 
05:55:22.548 --> 05:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
day and I think um some of that is
 
05:55:24.670 --> 05:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
echoed in the Texas decision uh which I
 
05:55:26.548 --> 05:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
would encourage the committee to
 
05:55:28.590 --> 05:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
review other question questions for this
 
05:55:30.868 --> 05:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
witness so Mr President I I I haven't
 
05:55:32.750 --> 05:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
read the Texas decision and obviously
 
05:55:36.070 --> 05:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
something that I will do but um let me
 
05:55:39.030 --> 05:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
ask you I the the language in section
 
05:55:41.468 --> 05:55:41.478 align:start position:0%
four of this bill and as again as I say
 
05:55:45.190 --> 05:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
if you if you assume that that the
 
05:55:48.788 --> 05:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
requirement to meet the definition is
 
05:55:51.990 --> 05:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
that it must meet all of the subsections
 
05:55:54.670 --> 05:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
a b and c not just any one of them but
 
05:55:57.590 --> 05:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
all of them my understanding is that
 
05:56:00.310 --> 05:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
that language comes
 
05:56:03.590 --> 05:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
largely from existing Supreme Court case
 
05:56:07.310 --> 05:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
law on what is pornography and I
 
05:56:11.468 --> 05:56:11.478 align:start position:0%
think that that case law would say that
 
05:56:13.750 --> 05:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
even as to
 
05:56:17.150 --> 05:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
adults something that meets that
 
05:56:19.430 --> 05:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
definition could be
 
05:56:22.510 --> 05:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
prohibited so if that's if that's true
 
05:56:24.990 --> 05:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
and this doesn't prohibit that as to
 
05:56:26.910 --> 05:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
adults in other words I guess what I'm
 
05:56:29.350 --> 05:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
saying is if if it's true that that
 
05:56:32.510 --> 05:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
definition would allow a state to
 
05:56:35.628 --> 05:56:35.638 align:start position:0%
prohibit even adults from possessing
 
05:56:39.310 --> 05:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
such material why and we don't do that
 
05:56:41.510 --> 05:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
why would it be unconstitutional as to
 
05:56:43.548 --> 05:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
Children yeah so this language comes
 
05:56:45.590 --> 05:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
from the Ginsburg decision uh which is
 
05:56:47.430 --> 05:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
also footnoted and the point that really
 
05:56:48.788 --> 05:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
I was trying to make here is when you
 
05:56:50.948 --> 05:56:50.958 align:start position:0%
look at that standard with respect to
 
05:56:54.350 --> 05:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
minors on line 13 when you look at that
 
05:56:57.510 --> 05:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
standard um on line 18 with respect to
 
05:56:57.520 --> 05:56:58.830 align:start position:0%
standard um on line 18 with respect to
min

05:56:58.830 --> 05:56:58.840 align:start position:0%
min
 
05:57:01.590 --> 05:57:01.600 align:start position:0%
is that there easily could be a set of
 
05:57:04.110 --> 05:57:04.120 align:start position:0%
information that fits this criteria as
 
05:57:06.788 --> 05:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
to miners but wouldn't as to adults
 
05:57:08.350 --> 05:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
which is the Miller test right which
 
05:57:10.468 --> 05:57:10.478 align:start position:0%
came down several years before so there
 
05:57:13.830 --> 05:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
is a gap there it is true if um this
 
05:57:15.948 --> 05:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
said with respect to adults that would
 
05:57:17.788 --> 05:57:17.798 align:start position:0%
fit the Miller definition of obscenity
 
05:57:19.350 --> 05:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
which is not protected which can be
 
05:57:21.270 --> 05:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
regulated the point that I'm just trying
 
05:57:23.868 --> 05:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
to make here is this would cover
 
05:57:27.230 --> 05:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
material that's that that is protected
 
05:57:29.030 --> 05:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
as to a adults that would be on these
 
05:57:30.628 --> 05:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
websites that individuals would now have
 
05:57:33.230 --> 05:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
to use their license to access and the
 
05:57:35.788 --> 05:57:35.798 align:start position:0%
concern that we have given the fact that
 
05:57:37.910 --> 05:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
that information would be protected
 
05:57:40.948 --> 05:57:40.958 align:start position:0%
under uh Miller uh um because you could
 
05:57:42.430 --> 05:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
have something that's prohibited as two
 
05:57:44.070 --> 05:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
minors but not as adults that that would
 
05:57:46.310 --> 05:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
provide a chill with respect to access
 
05:57:48.390 --> 05:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
that information okay well I no I guess
 
05:57:49.590 --> 05:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure I think I'm a little
 
05:57:51.150 --> 05:57:51.160 align:start position:0%
bit confused because I'm guess what I'm
 
05:57:53.190 --> 05:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
saying is I I certainly agree with you
 
05:57:55.310 --> 05:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
completely that there can be differences
 
05:57:58.110 --> 05:57:58.120 align:start position:0%
between what is prohibited as to adult
 
05:58:00.150 --> 05:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
what is prohibited as to children but
 
05:58:03.110 --> 05:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:07.070 --> 05:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
is isn't am I incorrect that something
 
05:58:11.270 --> 05:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
that meets the definition of A and B and
 
05:58:11.280 --> 05:58:12.910 align:start position:0%
that meets the definition of A and B and
C

05:58:12.910 --> 05:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
C
 
05:58:16.948 --> 05:58:16.958 align:start position:0%
is a a state can prohibit that even as
 
05:58:16.958 --> 05:58:19.190 align:start position:0%
is a a state can prohibit that even as
to

05:58:19.190 --> 05:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:58:22.070 --> 05:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
adults I'm not sure about that I guess
 
05:58:23.430 --> 05:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
and that's maybe where there's a
 
05:58:26.310 --> 05:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
disconnect here is that I I have I've
 
05:58:27.510 --> 05:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
always kind of thought that there was a
 
05:58:27.520 --> 05:58:28.548 align:start position:0%
always kind of thought that there was a
gap

05:58:28.548 --> 05:58:28.558 align:start position:0%
gap
 
05:58:30.350 --> 05:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
um there right because you can have
 
05:58:32.510 --> 05:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
something that this would be not
 
05:58:34.910 --> 05:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
protected with respect to minor access
 
05:58:36.430 --> 05:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
that's the Ginsburg decision but it
 
05:58:38.910 --> 05:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
could be uh could be protected under the
 
05:58:40.350 --> 05:58:40.360 align:start position:0%
First Amendment because it doesn't meet
 
05:58:42.430 --> 05:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
the same standard as to adults which
 
05:58:44.468 --> 05:58:44.478 align:start position:0%
would be the Miller test and so that's
 
05:58:46.468 --> 05:58:46.478 align:start position:0%
where I just kind of see a gap here I
 
05:58:49.310 --> 05:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
hope that makes I hope that makes sense
 
05:58:50.830 --> 05:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
I I I I think I understand what you're
 
05:58:53.628 --> 05:58:53.638 align:start position:0%
saying all right um all right other
 
05:58:56.150 --> 05:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
question yes representative gon please
 
05:58:58.390 --> 05:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:59:01.310 --> 05:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned this chilling effect
 
05:59:02.190 --> 05:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm
 
05:59:06.070 --> 05:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
wondering does age
 
05:59:08.390 --> 05:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
verification where the government has
 
05:59:11.190 --> 05:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
imposed a an age
 
05:59:13.948 --> 05:59:13.958 align:start position:0%
restriction provide a chilling effect on
 
05:59:15.750 --> 05:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
any other activities like say maybe
 
05:59:18.590 --> 05:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:20.548 --> 05:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
tattoo you're you're worried about
 
05:59:23.628 --> 05:59:23.638 align:start position:0%
you're worried about chilling effect
 
05:59:25.990 --> 05:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
yeah because government might impose an
 
05:59:28.030 --> 05:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
age restriction is there any chilling
 
05:59:30.590 --> 05:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
effect on people getting tattoos maybe
 
05:59:32.270 --> 05:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
which is Free Speech maybe that's I mean
 
05:59:33.910 --> 05:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
that maybe the same argument could be
 
05:59:35.590 --> 05:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
made there I mean again I think the
 
05:59:37.350 --> 05:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
concern that we have at the end of the
 
05:59:39.310 --> 05:59:39.320 align:start position:0%
day is you have a chilling effect with
 
05:59:40.830 --> 05:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
respect to First Amendment protected
 
05:59:43.468 --> 05:59:43.478 align:start position:0%
activity which is um I think the same
 
05:59:45.390 --> 05:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
analysis where that the Texas Court
 
05:59:48.788 --> 05:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
landed on in its preliminary injunction
 
05:59:51.230 --> 05:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
decision yes uh representative Alexander
 
05:59:53.548 --> 05:59:53.558 align:start position:0%
please thank you um thank you for taking
 
05:59:56.270 --> 05:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
my question um the recently passed
 
05:59:57.788 --> 05:59:57.798 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment regarding the
 
05:59:59.110 --> 05:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
right to privacy nobody's brought that
 
06:00:01.430 --> 06:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
up today but I guess I'm wondering would
 
06:00:04.030 --> 06:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
this be a violation in your opinion of
 
06:00:06.150 --> 06:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
that new Constitutional Amendment
 
06:00:07.548 --> 06:00:07.558 align:start position:0%
because the government is opposing the
 
06:00:10.030 --> 06:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
age restriction on license ver
 
06:00:11.590 --> 06:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
verification not the private company
 
06:00:13.948 --> 06:00:13.958 align:start position:0%
itself which in the situations
 
06:00:15.468 --> 06:00:15.478 align:start position:0%
representative gon gave they were
 
06:00:17.430 --> 06:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
private companies imposing that in this
 
06:00:19.190 --> 06:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
case we're telling the private company
 
06:00:20.590 --> 06:00:20.600 align:start position:0%
they must verify the
 
06:00:22.788 --> 06:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
age it's a good qu I think the answer is
 
06:00:25.190 --> 06:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know to be honest well you're
 
06:00:26.948 --> 06:00:26.958 align:start position:0%
not a constit you're not a Supreme Court
 
06:00:28.430 --> 06:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
Judge right yeah
 
06:00:30.868 --> 06:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
um you know the the the right to
 
06:00:32.230 --> 06:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
informational privacy under the state
 
06:00:34.350 --> 06:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
constitution is is new um and I don't
 
06:00:36.070 --> 06:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
think we've really seen uh certainly the
 
06:00:37.830 --> 06:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
state supreme court evaluate what the
 
06:00:41.910 --> 06:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
Contour of that um is I my I suspect
 
06:00:43.830 --> 06:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
that proponents of this bill would say
 
06:00:45.270 --> 06:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
it probably doesn't violate those
 
06:00:46.990 --> 06:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
Provisions in part because the language
 
06:00:50.628 --> 06:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
on page two lines 28 through 29 that
 
06:00:53.070 --> 06:00:53.080 align:start position:0%
talk about how this information can't be
 
06:00:56.070 --> 06:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
retained you know for for various uh
 
06:00:58.110 --> 06:00:58.120 align:start position:0%
purposes um you know we don't think
 
06:01:00.390 --> 06:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's sufficient for various reasons uh
 
06:01:02.590 --> 06:01:02.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to U the chill that would
 
06:01:05.270 --> 06:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
that we think would would be created um
 
06:01:08.468 --> 06:01:08.478 align:start position:0%
but I suspect that PE people could rely
 
06:01:09.708 --> 06:01:09.718 align:start position:0%
on this language to say it does not
 
06:01:12.030 --> 06:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
violate that state constitutional
 
06:01:15.390 --> 06:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
provision yes representative gon you you
 
06:01:17.628 --> 06:01:17.638 align:start position:0%
bring up an excellent point uh if we
 
06:01:20.590 --> 06:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
were to include language in this bill
 
06:01:23.510 --> 06:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
that says anyone uh found in violation
 
06:01:26.830 --> 06:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
of the new right to privacy uh a company
 
06:01:29.030 --> 06:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
that retain CH this data would then you
 
06:01:30.628 --> 06:01:30.638 align:start position:0%
know just reinforcing that that is in
 
06:01:32.548 --> 06:01:32.558 align:start position:0%
the law that they would be subject to
 
06:01:35.910 --> 06:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
that uh to to the to that new law if we
 
06:01:37.390 --> 06:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
put that statement in there if you keep
 
06:01:39.990 --> 06:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
the data uh or retain the data then you
 
06:01:41.830 --> 06:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
would be subject to that law we put that
 
06:01:43.468 --> 06:01:43.478 align:start position:0%
in there is some language in there yeah
 
06:01:45.270 --> 06:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
I think that language is already in here
 
06:01:47.430 --> 06:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
and and um as I articulate I just don't
 
06:01:48.948 --> 06:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
think that that's sufficient there was
 
06:01:50.590 --> 06:01:50.600 align:start position:0%
similar language in Texas if I'm not
 
06:01:51.910 --> 06:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
mistaken as
 
06:01:54.868 --> 06:01:54.878 align:start position:0%

06:02:25.868 --> 06:02:25.878 align:start position:0%
hi hello Judiciary
 
06:02:28.990 --> 06:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
Committee my name is is Trisha nalu I'm
 
06:02:31.030 --> 06:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
representing myself and my community
 
06:02:34.150 --> 06:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
today I am a certified sex educator and
 
06:02:36.788 --> 06:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
intimacy coordinator and I have been an
 
06:02:38.110 --> 06:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
actor and producer of adult
 
06:02:41.230 --> 06:02:41.240 align:start position:0%
entertainment for 20 years I am also
 
06:02:43.230 --> 06:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
founder of the erotic laborers Alliance
 
06:02:45.670 --> 06:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:49.350 --> 06:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
England I worked recently on a
 
06:02:52.670 --> 06:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum called porn Literacy for
 
06:02:52.680 --> 06:02:53.830 align:start position:0%
curriculum called porn Literacy for
Boston

06:02:53.830 --> 06:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
Boston
 
06:02:57.868 --> 06:02:57.878 align:start position:0%
University and the goal for that was for
 
06:03:00.590 --> 06:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
High School curriculum teaching the
 
06:03:03.390 --> 06:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
difference between entertainment and
 
06:03:06.910 --> 06:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
education clearly there's a lack of
 
06:03:10.670 --> 06:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
comprehensive sexual education in this
 
06:03:14.030 --> 06:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
country I oppose this bill on behalf of
 
06:03:17.310 --> 06:03:17.320 align:start position:0%
myself and my community because House
 
06:03:20.030 --> 06:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 1256 harms the consumer and the
 
06:03:22.468 --> 06:03:22.478 align:start position:0%
content creator First Amendment
 
06:03:25.030 --> 06:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
protections apply to online speech as
 
06:03:25.948 --> 06:03:25.958 align:start position:0%
much as
 
06:03:27.830 --> 06:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
offline with a the third party
 
06:03:30.510 --> 06:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
government regulation on our websites is
 
06:03:32.468 --> 06:03:32.478 align:start position:0%
not clear if we would be allowing access
 
06:03:34.350 --> 06:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
to all Communications between content
 
06:03:36.868 --> 06:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
creator and
 
06:03:39.230 --> 06:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
consumer that would naturally deter
 
06:03:41.430 --> 06:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
consumers from trusting that their adult
 
06:03:44.310 --> 06:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
appetites and or Communications within
 
06:03:47.468 --> 06:03:47.478 align:start position:0%
the website would be
 
06:03:50.590 --> 06:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
private in 1996 the US Congress passed a
 
06:03:52.910 --> 06:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
law section 230 originally part of the
 
06:03:55.590 --> 06:03:55.600 align:start position:0%

06:04:05.868 --> 06:04:05.878 align:start position:0%
encourage internet users and services to

create and find communities section 230
 
06:04:11.670 --> 06:04:11.680 align:start position:0%

06:04:14.310 --> 06:04:14.320 align:start position:0%

have new ways to control the content

that they see it is not currently the
 
06:04:40.468 --> 06:04:40.478 align:start position:0%
burden of the state to collect and

Mississippi Arkansas and as you heard
 
06:04:56.190 --> 06:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
Texas it's already resulting in a an out
 
06:05:00.310 --> 06:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
of work situation for adult content
 
06:05:02.910 --> 06:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
creators the New Hampshire adults that
 
06:05:04.990 --> 06:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
are seeking entertainment deserve to
 
06:05:07.390 --> 06:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
search the vast worldwide web without
 
06:05:09.350 --> 06:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
having to upload their government issued
 
06:05:11.990 --> 06:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
identification we can all agree that
 
06:05:13.990 --> 06:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
underage viewing of adult entertainment
 
06:05:16.708 --> 06:05:16.718 align:start position:0%
is not something that we want happening
 
06:05:18.948 --> 06:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
all of
 
06:05:24.270 --> 06:05:24.280 align:start position:0%
us and to note on earlier comments not

everyone who produces Adult
 
06:05:28.750 --> 06:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
Entertainment is a groomer
 
06:05:30.868 --> 06:05:30.878 align:start position:0%
um there are other ways to protect
 
06:05:32.868 --> 06:05:32.878 align:start position:0%

material we believe in our community
 
06:05:41.390 --> 06:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
that parents not government should
 
06:05:43.990 --> 06:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
restrict what is allowed to be viewed
 
06:05:46.548 --> 06:05:46.558 align:start position:0%
there is technology that exists to Aid
 
06:05:48.230 --> 06:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
in the parental responsibility to
 
06:05:50.230 --> 06:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
control the potential content that their

brief uh history on how this came to be
 
06:07:50.230 --> 06:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
there number of bills related to
 
06:07:53.910 --> 06:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
occupational licensing that the governor
 
06:07:57.310 --> 06:07:57.320 align:start position:0%
requested um Majority Leader Osborne to
 
06:08:00.350 --> 06:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
submit he submitted the lsrs but doesn't
 
06:08:01.788 --> 06:08:01.798 align:start position:0%
didn't have time to deal with them nor
 
06:08:03.910 --> 06:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
did the chair of house cdna and I got
 
06:08:07.670 --> 06:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
asked to uh to take care of these and uh
 
06:08:09.230 --> 06:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
anyway so that's why I'm introducing
 
06:08:11.190 --> 06:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
this rather than representative
 
06:08:14.548 --> 06:08:14.558 align:start position:0%
Osborne um basically what this does is
 
06:08:17.510 --> 06:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
repeal the uh the requirement for court
 
06:08:19.190 --> 06:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
reporters to be
 
06:08:22.230 --> 06:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
licensed um what I handed around is the

application uh to get a license a court
 
06:08:27.868 --> 06:08:27.878 align:start position:0%

06:08:30.830 --> 06:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
requirements other than paying a $300
 
06:08:34.390 --> 06:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
fee is uh to show that you and provide

06:09:11.430 --> 06:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
position um there's someone here from
 
06:09:14.628 --> 06:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
oplc that can give uh details on their
 
06:09:17.150 --> 06:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
experience with the court reporters but
 
06:09:19.390 --> 06:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
basically there's relatively few of them
 
06:09:20.230 --> 06:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
that are
 
06:09:23.830 --> 06:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
licensed and um for the last quite a few
 
06:09:25.910 --> 06:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
years there have been um zero
 
06:09:27.830 --> 06:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
disciplinary issues the boards basically
 
06:09:32.310 --> 06:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do and um and I I don't
 
06:09:35.628 --> 06:09:35.638 align:start position:0%
believe I don't believe that uh there's
 
06:09:38.190 --> 06:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
a a need for this license to exist
 
06:09:42.468 --> 06:09:42.478 align:start position:0%
anymore um I can answer questions but um
 
06:09:45.150 --> 06:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
they might be better directed to uh the
 
06:09:47.110 --> 06:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
person here from oplc but I'll do what I
 
06:09:49.070 --> 06:09:49.080 align:start position:0%

opposition to this bill on January 1st
 
06:10:29.948 --> 06:10:29.958 align:start position:0%
of 2000 I retired after 26 years with
 
06:10:32.468 --> 06:10:32.478 align:start position:0%

States Marshall Services a supervisory
 
06:10:38.910 --> 06:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
Deputy US Marshall and I spent a lot of
 
06:10:41.190 --> 06:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
time in federal courts all across the
 
06:10:44.548 --> 06:10:44.558 align:start position:0%
country but primarily here in New
 
06:10:46.948 --> 06:10:46.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I can still hear the words
 
06:10:49.190 --> 06:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
of the late chief judge of the US
 
06:10:51.548 --> 06:10:51.558 align:start position:0%
District Court for New Hampshire judge
 
06:10:53.788 --> 06:10:53.798 align:start position:0%
Shane Devine telling an attorney who was
 
06:10:56.670 --> 06:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
speaking so fast that you were s they
 
06:10:59.310 --> 06:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
were getting paid by the word to slow
 
06:11:01.990 --> 06:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
down and as judge Divine would tell
 
06:11:04.628 --> 06:11:04.638 align:start position:0%
councel councel of the most important
 
06:11:06.708 --> 06:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
person in this courtroom isn't me the
 
06:11:10.030 --> 06:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
trial judge it's our court reporter
 
06:11:12.628 --> 06:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
who's making a complete record of every
 
06:11:16.788 --> 06:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
word that's being said in this courtroom
 
06:11:20.430 --> 06:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
today Mickey Spain was an author of the
 
06:11:23.390 --> 06:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
popular uh Mike Hammer detective
 
06:11:26.270 --> 06:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
novels and he once got a h copy of one
 
06:11:27.948 --> 06:11:27.958 align:start position:0%
of his latest book back from the
 
06:11:30.468 --> 06:11:30.478 align:start position:0%
publisher and he realized the publisher
 
06:11:34.548 --> 06:11:34.558 align:start position:0%
left out six words so he called his uh
 
06:11:36.750 --> 06:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
editor of Simon and Schuster and said
 
06:11:39.628 --> 06:11:39.638 align:start position:0%
you took six words out of my book why he
 
06:11:41.390 --> 06:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
said Mickey you don't understand in
 
06:11:43.310 --> 06:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
publishing these books by having one
 
06:11:46.110 --> 06:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
full page we could take out of the book
 
06:11:48.670 --> 06:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
by not having those words there and when
 
06:11:50.350 --> 06:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
you're printing thousands of books
 
06:11:52.230 --> 06:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
you're saving a lot of money by not
 
06:11:54.990 --> 06:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
having one page eliminated so that's a
 
06:11:57.430 --> 06:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
good thing and he says Mickey here at
 
06:12:00.510 --> 06:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
Simon and Schuster our average novel is
 
06:12:03.510 --> 06:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
70,000 Pages do you think anybody's
 
06:12:05.190 --> 06:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
going to miss six
 
06:12:07.910 --> 06:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
words so in his next manuscript he sent
 
06:12:10.030 --> 06:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
to Simon and Schuster the editor was
 
06:12:12.190 --> 06:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
reading it proof reading it got to the
 
06:12:14.390 --> 06:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
end and I can't remember the exact words
 
06:12:16.990 --> 06:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
but it was something to the effect that
 
06:12:20.510 --> 06:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
at that point my camera realized that
 
06:12:22.350 --> 06:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
only one person could have committed
 
06:12:25.430 --> 06:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
this murder and that person was and he
 
06:12:27.230 --> 06:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
left it blank
 
06:12:29.190 --> 06:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
and he got a call from his aditor and he
 
06:12:31.590 --> 06:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
said Mickey what are you doing who who
 
06:12:33.390 --> 06:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
was the murder you didn't put in your
 
06:12:36.110 --> 06:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
transcript he said you told me that six
 
06:12:38.750 --> 06:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
words weren't important now you know
 
06:12:41.788 --> 06:12:41.798 align:start position:0%
that one word can be important for a
 
06:12:43.910 --> 06:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
defendant going through the court system
 
06:12:46.910 --> 06:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
in here in the granted state if you're
 
06:12:49.590 --> 06:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
appealing a conviction regardless of the
 
06:12:52.270 --> 06:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
grounds it's nice to know that the
 
06:12:55.708 --> 06:12:55.718 align:start position:0%
certified court reporters in this state
 
06:12:55.718 --> 06:12:56.990 align:start position:0%
certified court reporters in this state
realize

06:12:56.990 --> 06:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
realize
 
06:13:00.830 --> 06:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
like Mickey Spain every single word that
 
06:13:03.430 --> 06:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
is said is important and it could be
 
06:13:05.350 --> 06:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
important to a defendant trying to get
 
06:13:08.670 --> 06:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
an appeal after a conviction and with
 
06:13:10.548 --> 06:13:10.558 align:start position:0%
that I'll conclude Mr chairman any
 
06:13:12.990 --> 06:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be glad to answer them
 
06:13:14.548 --> 06:13:14.558 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
06:13:18.070 --> 06:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative
 
06:13:23.990 --> 06:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:28.030 --> 06:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
that um represent resentative is I'm
 
06:13:30.868 --> 06:13:30.878 align:start position:0%
interested in knowing whether there's
 
06:13:35.750 --> 06:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
any issue um with court reporters about
 
06:13:35.760 --> 06:13:36.868 align:start position:0%
any issue um with court reporters about
for

06:13:36.868 --> 06:13:36.878 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:13:39.830 --> 06:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
example confidential
 
06:13:43.708 --> 06:13:43.718 align:start position:0%
information to which they are privy by
 
06:13:47.670 --> 06:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
nature of of what they're doing and what
 
06:13:51.030 --> 06:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
system we have we would have if they
 
06:13:57.510 --> 06:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
were not to be licensed um to guarantee
 
06:14:02.350 --> 06:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
the protection of all parties involved
 
06:14:05.670 --> 06:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
in a Judicial matter well I think that's
 
06:14:09.548 --> 06:14:09.558 align:start position:0%
a a genuinely an important question uh
 
06:14:11.390 --> 06:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned earlier the court
 
06:14:13.150 --> 06:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
reporters and members of the national
 
06:14:15.390 --> 06:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
Court we Porters
 
06:14:17.628 --> 06:14:17.638 align:start position:0%
Association um and there was mentioned
 
06:14:20.110 --> 06:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
that's a private organization but so is
 
06:14:22.750 --> 06:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
the American buyer Association and the
 
06:14:24.468 --> 06:14:24.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire buyer
 
06:14:26.868 --> 06:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
Association um they
 
06:14:29.990 --> 06:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
regulate who is a member of that
 
06:14:32.350 --> 06:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
organization and there's criteria
 
06:14:33.948 --> 06:14:33.958 align:start position:0%
there's different levels they can
 
06:14:38.070 --> 06:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
achieve uh in the reporting they do and
 
06:14:41.628 --> 06:14:41.638 align:start position:0%
um one thing I never saw in my 26 years
 
06:14:45.590 --> 06:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
in the federal court no one ever
 
06:14:48.390 --> 06:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
ever had any questions about a
 
06:14:50.468 --> 06:14:50.478 align:start position:0%
transcript or anything that came out of
 
06:14:52.910 --> 06:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
a court reporter because they knew it
 
06:14:55.270 --> 06:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
was going to be a quality product and it
 
06:14:57.830 --> 06:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
was going to be exact ly what should be
 
06:15:00.230 --> 06:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
presented most importantly to appeals
 
06:15:02.750 --> 06:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
court or even up to the US Supreme Court
 
06:15:05.708 --> 06:15:05.718 align:start position:0%
without that licens to procedure The
 
06:15:07.310 --> 06:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
Village Idiot could say they're a court
 
06:15:09.670 --> 06:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
reporter and then we'd pay the
 
06:15:11.548 --> 06:15:11.558 align:start position:0%
consequences but I'm not going to be a
 
06:15:13.190 --> 06:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
court reporter so I got to eliminate The
 
06:15:15.070 --> 06:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
Village Idiot
 
06:15:19.270 --> 06:15:19.280 align:start position:0%

06:16:47.718 --> 06:16:48.788 align:start position:0%
from some private National Organization
or

06:16:48.788 --> 06:16:48.798 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:16:51.350 --> 06:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
such that's not a question I think I can
 
06:16:55.030 --> 06:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
answer I don't know how many professions
 
06:16:56.990 --> 06:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
that are outside of the open PLC require
 
06:17:00.030 --> 06:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
certification that don't fall under our
 
06:17:02.708 --> 06:17:02.718 align:start position:0%

06:17:04.628 --> 06:17:04.638 align:start position:0%

on this bill okay thank you other
 
06:17:15.510 --> 06:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
questions so can I ask you sir um I I
 
06:17:18.350 --> 06:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
representative sherli was here I think
 
06:17:20.868 --> 06:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
he uh he was as he indicated he was
 
06:17:24.310 --> 06:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
mostly U aware based on his uh service
 
06:17:26.750 --> 06:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
in the federal system
 
06:17:30.150 --> 06:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
am I understanding correctly that
 
06:17:34.310 --> 06:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
for at least since the early
 
06:17:37.910 --> 06:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
2000s the state court system does not
 
06:17:40.590 --> 06:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
make use of court reporters
 
06:17:44.750 --> 06:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
in regular Court proceedings we now have
 
06:17:49.310 --> 06:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
court monitors um who are who basically
 
06:17:51.868 --> 06:17:51.878 align:start position:0%
they they I don't mean to oversimplify
 
06:17:55.750 --> 06:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
but they they push the record button um
 
06:17:57.830 --> 06:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
and when this when the hearing starts
 
06:18:00.590 --> 06:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
and they stop it when they're when the
 
06:18:02.910 --> 06:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
hearing is over or and maybe stop it in
 
06:18:04.590 --> 06:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
between but they're not and they are not
 
06:18:06.590 --> 06:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
licensed is that
 
06:18:08.750 --> 06:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
correct I'm not aware that there's a
 
06:18:11.390 --> 06:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
license I I haven't been in a courtroom
 
06:18:13.670 --> 06:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
in two years um prior to that I did
 
06:18:15.270 --> 06:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
litigate and I don't think I was ever in
 
06:18:17.030 --> 06:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
a room with a court reporter but there
 
06:18:19.670 --> 06:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
may be people here who can speak to that
 
06:18:22.150 --> 06:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
better than I can but it was in my
 
06:18:25.510 --> 06:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
experience recorded record right and so
 
06:18:28.390 --> 06:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
I I will be Happ I certainly will ask
 
06:18:30.270 --> 06:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
questions of other people who may
 
06:18:33.548 --> 06:18:33.558 align:start position:0%
testify but my understanding is and
 
06:18:34.990 --> 06:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
again correct me if you have different
 
06:18:35.000 --> 06:18:36.510 align:start position:0%
again correct me if you have different
information

06:18:36.510 --> 06:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:18:39.270 --> 06:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
that traditional court reporters that
 
06:18:42.548 --> 06:18:42.558 align:start position:0%
are subject to lure under this are
 
06:18:44.548 --> 06:18:44.558 align:start position:0%
really only used
 
06:18:47.310 --> 06:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
now basically
 
06:18:50.310 --> 06:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
for depositions and things other words
 
06:18:52.030 --> 06:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
they don't appear they're not there in
 
06:18:54.430 --> 06:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
court because the court has its own
 
06:18:56.548 --> 06:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
Court monitors who
 
06:18:58.830 --> 06:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
um who are not court
 
06:19:01.150 --> 06:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
reporters in my experience I haven't
 
06:19:03.150 --> 06:19:03.160 align:start position:0%
seen a court reporter but I can't speak
 
06:19:04.990 --> 06:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
as to what the licensed individuals are
 
06:19:08.110 --> 06:19:08.120 align:start position:0%

a lot of personal information I hope
 
06:20:20.990 --> 06:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
this addresses your concerns
 
06:20:23.670 --> 06:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative Smith um their
 
06:20:25.830 --> 06:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
information should remain private and
 
06:20:27.910 --> 06:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
Protected Their pii their personal
 
06:20:30.590 --> 06:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information the
 
06:20:33.390 --> 06:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
majority of work is uh in divorce during
 
06:20:35.948 --> 06:20:35.958 align:start position:0%
a deposition I will hear about children
 
06:20:38.788 --> 06:20:38.798 align:start position:0%
I know their names ages where they go to
 
06:20:41.750 --> 06:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
school I find out who their doctors and
 
06:20:43.390 --> 06:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
therapists are what their
 
06:20:46.190 --> 06:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
extracurricular activities are um their
 
06:20:48.868 --> 06:20:48.878 align:start position:0%
day-to-day schedule if that gets into an
 
06:20:52.190 --> 06:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
unlicensed unregulated person's hands I
 
06:20:53.990 --> 06:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
I shutter to think what could what could
 
06:20:56.230 --> 06:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
happen I'll also hear about the husband
 
06:20:58.670 --> 06:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
and wife I know everything that they do
 
06:21:02.310 --> 06:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
I know their jobs their incomes um their
 
06:21:04.510 --> 06:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
assets and liabilities I know with their
 
06:21:07.788 --> 06:21:07.798 align:start position:0%
mortgages um I Mark bank statements
 
06:21:10.190 --> 06:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
years worth of bank statements and tax
 
06:21:12.310 --> 06:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
returns that have account information
 
06:21:16.030 --> 06:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
and so Security numbers I protect that
 
06:21:18.750 --> 06:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
information and since it's divorce I
 
06:21:20.910 --> 06:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
will also hear all of the dirty little
 
06:21:23.468 --> 06:21:23.478 align:start position:0%
secrets I take depositions some real
 
06:21:25.110 --> 06:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
world examples that I have personally
 
06:21:26.390 --> 06:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
done is
 
06:21:28.468 --> 06:21:28.478 align:start position:0%
a husband is asked where the safe is in
 
06:21:30.230 --> 06:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
his home and how and what's in it and
 
06:21:32.030 --> 06:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
he'll tell the opposing Council where
 
06:21:34.030 --> 06:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
the safe is and that there's in this
 
06:21:34.040 --> 06:21:35.510 align:start position:0%
the safe is and that there's in this
example

06:21:35.510 --> 06:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
example
 
06:21:38.510 --> 06:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
$247,000 worth of gold in another
 
06:21:41.990 --> 06:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
example a husband at a at a executive
 
06:21:44.190 --> 06:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
position in a high very popular
 
06:21:47.030 --> 06:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
financial institution misappropriated
 
06:21:49.830 --> 06:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
$400,000 of marital funds at a local
 
06:21:53.830 --> 06:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
gentleman's club for various Services a
 
06:21:55.708 --> 06:21:55.718 align:start position:0%
wife would take tennis lessons and learn
 
06:21:57.868 --> 06:21:57.878 align:start position:0%
nothing from the instructor we'll learn
 
06:22:01.548 --> 06:22:01.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:03.628 --> 06:22:03.638 align:start position:0%
tennis my point being if that
 
06:22:05.270 --> 06:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
information gets out someone could get
 
06:22:07.510 --> 06:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
robbed someone could lose their job
 
06:22:09.350 --> 06:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
someone's reputation is
 
06:22:12.468 --> 06:22:12.478 align:start position:0%
ruined and my point is in order to
 
06:22:14.948 --> 06:22:14.958 align:start position:0%
maintain my relationer I am ethically
 
06:22:18.230 --> 06:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
bound to keep that information private
 
06:22:21.270 --> 06:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
and secure and safe I take continuing
 
06:22:24.070 --> 06:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
education credits I'm required to and
 
06:22:25.510 --> 06:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
that the courses involved technical
 
06:22:27.350 --> 06:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
techical advancements in my field data
 
06:22:30.150 --> 06:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
encryption cyber security ethical
 
06:22:32.708 --> 06:22:32.718 align:start position:0%
obligations and duties that I have
 
06:22:35.110 --> 06:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
taking away a licensure means that just
 
06:22:37.270 --> 06:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
just what was said anybody can come in
 
06:22:39.990 --> 06:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
put a tape recorder on the table record
 
06:22:42.030 --> 06:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
the proceedings at a deposition and send
 
06:22:44.270 --> 06:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
that recording out to to gosh knows
 
06:22:47.390 --> 06:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
where to be transcribed by who where is
 
06:22:49.030 --> 06:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
the chain of custody who has that
 
06:22:50.788 --> 06:22:50.798 align:start position:0%
recording and more importantly who is
 
06:22:52.670 --> 06:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
making sure that nobody is manipulating
 
06:22:55.868 --> 06:22:55.878 align:start position:0%
that recording in these days of a AI the
 
06:22:59.190 --> 06:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence um they're be
 
06:23:00.868 --> 06:23:00.878 align:start position:0%
they're being touted as a replacement
 
06:23:02.190 --> 06:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
for court reporters I'm not worried
 
06:23:05.590 --> 06:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
about my job I am seriously worried
 
06:23:07.468 --> 06:23:07.478 align:start position:0%
about the litigants and what's going to
 
06:23:08.788 --> 06:23:08.798 align:start position:0%
happen to their
 
06:23:11.590 --> 06:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
information if there's no regulation No
 
06:23:13.190 --> 06:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
Authority no recourse with other
 
06:23:15.350 --> 06:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
methodology in capturing the record and
 
06:23:17.230 --> 06:23:17.240 align:start position:0%
no one to complain to when a problem
 
06:23:19.910 --> 06:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
arises with using inferior technology
 
06:23:21.788 --> 06:23:21.798 align:start position:0%
what is the public supposed to do
 
06:23:24.190 --> 06:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
there's no one those recordings could
 
06:23:25.868 --> 06:23:25.878 align:start position:0%
easily be manipulated it's it's easy
 
06:23:28.070 --> 06:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
even today to change a yes to a no in an
 
06:23:30.390 --> 06:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
audio or video recording to fake
 
06:23:33.030 --> 06:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
someone's what someone has said what's
 
06:23:35.150 --> 06:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
going to happen tomorrow when an actual
 
06:23:36.830 --> 06:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
when you can't decipher what an actual
 
06:23:39.190 --> 06:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
recording is compared to a manipulated
 
06:23:41.830 --> 06:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
copy that's coming the licens court
 
06:23:44.230 --> 06:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
reporter in a proceeding outside of a
 
06:23:46.390 --> 06:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
courtroom where those recordings that
 
06:23:48.788 --> 06:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
are in court are overseen by a judge
 
06:23:50.830 --> 06:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
they are done by a court monitor but a
 
06:23:53.548 --> 06:23:53.558 align:start position:0%
judge is there where are the officers of
 
06:23:54.830 --> 06:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
the Court where are the licensed court
 
06:23:56.868 --> 06:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
reporters in the actual depositions
 
06:23:59.590 --> 06:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
protecting The public's information
 
06:24:02.708 --> 06:24:02.718 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this witness
 
06:24:04.868 --> 06:24:04.878 align:start position:0%
representative tur could you just
 
06:24:07.510 --> 06:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
Briefly summarize what the Privileges
 
06:24:09.430 --> 06:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
that come with being a court reporter
 
06:24:11.230 --> 06:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
are and how sort of the lers
 
06:24:14.430 --> 06:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
operationalized in terms of your access
 
06:24:16.390 --> 06:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
does that question in terms of access to
 
06:24:18.350 --> 06:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
to the court proceedings or whatever
 
06:24:20.750 --> 06:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
whatever sensitive matters you'd be and
 
06:24:22.190 --> 06:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
mainly what what was discussed I
 
06:24:24.190 --> 06:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
apologize for cutting you off there um
 
06:24:25.830 --> 06:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
mainly what was discussed is we work in
 
06:24:27.948 --> 06:24:27.958 align:start position:0%
the depos we work in law offices we work
 
06:24:30.628 --> 06:24:30.638 align:start position:0%
at depositions we don't do Court workor
 
06:24:33.070 --> 06:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
unless we're paid privately to come in
 
06:24:34.948 --> 06:24:34.958 align:start position:0%
by attorneys not the state we're not
 
06:24:36.750 --> 06:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
employed by the state we are all
 
06:24:38.310 --> 06:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
independent contractors we're not
 
06:24:41.510 --> 06:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
employed by anyone so no employer is
 
06:24:45.070 --> 06:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
going to come and vet us for anything
 
06:24:48.670 --> 06:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
we're we're Bound by our lure that
 
06:24:50.468 --> 06:24:50.478 align:start position:0%
oversees the state rules yes our
 
06:24:51.868 --> 06:24:51.878 align:start position:0%
national license our national
 
06:24:53.990 --> 06:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
certifications just prove that we can
 
06:24:55.910 --> 06:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
write at this speed and without accuracy
 
06:24:57.788 --> 06:24:57.798 align:start position:0%
and we take tests written knowledge
 
06:25:00.190 --> 06:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
tests but we have to follow each State's
 
06:25:04.270 --> 06:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
rules I can't just move to Illinois
 
06:25:06.230 --> 06:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
because I have an rpr I have to get
 
06:25:08.070 --> 06:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
their state certification that's just an
 
06:25:09.628 --> 06:25:09.638 align:start position:0%
example I'm not sure if Chicago actually
 
06:25:12.510 --> 06:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
has that sorry so so just a quick
 
06:25:16.788 --> 06:25:16.798 align:start position:0%
followup for me um so so when entering
 
06:25:18.190 --> 06:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
these kind of proceedings that you're
 
06:25:21.110 --> 06:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
talking about your certification is is
 
06:25:24.110 --> 06:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
sort of examined by somebody currently
 
06:25:26.190 --> 06:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
yes every deposition that I open it has
 
06:25:28.548 --> 06:25:28.558 align:start position:0%
my license number on it I state that I'm
 
06:25:30.310 --> 06:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
a licensed court reporter I have it on
 
06:25:33.070 --> 06:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
my certificate page that I'm a licensed
 
06:25:35.548 --> 06:25:35.558 align:start position:0%
court reporter and am happy to answer
 
06:25:37.948 --> 06:25:37.958 align:start position:0%
any other questions that attorneys may
 
06:25:39.150 --> 06:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
have at a
 
06:25:41.590 --> 06:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
deposition about my qualifications
 
06:25:41.600 --> 06:25:43.030 align:start position:0%
deposition about my qualifications
representative

06:25:43.030 --> 06:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:25:45.430 --> 06:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
Kat thank you Mr chairman I have two
 
06:25:46.670 --> 06:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
questions if I
 
06:25:50.230 --> 06:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
may um
 
06:25:53.548 --> 06:25:53.558 align:start position:0%
first if you're already certified by the
 
06:25:56.708 --> 06:25:56.718 align:start position:0%
national court reporters associ
 
06:25:58.708 --> 06:25:58.718 align:start position:0%
and this isn't really asking any
 
06:25:58.718 --> 06:26:00.910 align:start position:0%
and this isn't really asking any
additional

06:26:00.910 --> 06:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
additional
 
06:26:05.230 --> 06:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
questions on here at all um what
 
06:26:07.670 --> 06:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
difference does it make between just
 
06:26:09.270 --> 06:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
having that like why couldn't you just
 
06:26:10.750 --> 06:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
give that to the people that are doing
 
06:26:12.750 --> 06:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
the deposition that hey I have this this
 
06:26:16.430 --> 06:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
is making you pay an extra $300 for the
 
06:26:18.670 --> 06:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
application what value is that adding to
 
06:26:21.310 --> 06:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
you we're happy to pay $300 thank you
 
06:26:25.230 --> 06:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
kind um but we have um the rsa's Megan
 
06:26:28.948 --> 06:26:28.958 align:start position:0%
hefler who is our legislative leaon um
 
06:26:30.830 --> 06:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
do you want to speak to this and the
 
06:26:33.350 --> 06:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
rules we have to follow we'll hear from
 
06:26:35.788 --> 06:26:35.798 align:start position:0%
her just second so I'll defer the
 
06:26:38.150 --> 06:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
question to Megan okay one other
 
06:26:41.190 --> 06:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
question if I may of course um so had
 
06:26:43.430 --> 06:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
asked so you're only being used
 
06:26:44.788 --> 06:26:44.798 align:start position:0%
privately right now you're not being
 
06:26:46.548 --> 06:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
used in the court so you're
 
06:26:50.430 --> 06:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
not accessing like say a a closed case
 
06:26:52.230 --> 06:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
that might be like a guardianship case
 
06:26:55.230 --> 06:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
that's you know a red confidential case
 
06:26:58.270 --> 06:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
you're accessing you're providing
 
06:27:00.510 --> 06:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
services for other things that like a
 
06:27:02.948 --> 06:27:02.958 align:start position:0%
divorce proceeding isn't typically a
 
06:27:04.750 --> 06:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
confidential case so if those things
 
06:27:06.310 --> 06:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
were submitted into court they are
 
06:27:07.750 --> 06:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
public information somebody could get
 
06:27:09.830 --> 06:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
them I understand why you're saying some
 
06:27:11.468 --> 06:27:11.478 align:start position:0%
people may not want that stuff disclosed
 
06:27:13.150 --> 06:27:13.160 align:start position:0%
but it's not typically like a private
 
06:27:14.708 --> 06:27:14.718 align:start position:0%
case you're not getting access into
 
06:27:17.230 --> 06:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
cases that are statutorily sealed is
 
06:27:18.868 --> 06:27:18.878 align:start position:0%
what I'm really trying to ask sure yes
 
06:27:20.548 --> 06:27:20.558 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that but depositions
 
06:27:22.910 --> 06:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
are not admitted into trials the
 
06:27:24.350 --> 06:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
testimony is admitted into trials
 
06:27:25.788 --> 06:27:25.798 align:start position:0%
depositions are just fact finding
 
06:27:29.468 --> 06:27:29.478 align:start position:0%
missions credibility um finders and
 
06:27:31.150 --> 06:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
stuff so everything that's testified to
 
06:27:34.590 --> 06:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
it a deposition is not going to be um
 
06:27:36.468 --> 06:27:36.478 align:start position:0%
testified to a
 
06:27:40.868 --> 06:27:40.878 align:start position:0%
trial thank you so question I I mean
 
06:27:42.670 --> 06:27:42.680 align:start position:0%
that that's not exactly true right I
 
06:27:45.070 --> 06:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
mean depositions are often used at trial
 
06:27:47.390 --> 06:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
to cross-examine Witnesses and uh used
 
06:27:49.468 --> 06:27:49.478 align:start position:0%
to impeach testimony you are correct um
 
06:27:51.110 --> 06:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
and sometime even even more than that
 
06:27:52.788 --> 06:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
depending on the circumstances they may
 
06:27:54.628 --> 06:27:54.638 align:start position:0%
come in if a witness isn't available or
 
06:27:54.638 --> 06:27:55.830 align:start position:0%
come in if a witness isn't available or
something

06:27:55.830 --> 06:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:27:57.990 --> 06:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
um the
 
06:28:00.948 --> 06:28:00.958 align:start position:0%
the so I you know the I I guess the
 
06:28:03.910 --> 06:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
thing I have real trouble with is all of
 
06:28:06.548 --> 06:28:06.558 align:start position:0%
the things that you say are so important
 
06:28:09.788 --> 06:28:09.798 align:start position:0%
that it that somebody be licensed for uh
 
06:28:11.190 --> 06:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
because of all the
 
06:28:11.200 --> 06:28:12.868 align:start position:0%
because of all the
dangers

06:28:12.868 --> 06:28:12.878 align:start position:0%
dangers
 
06:28:14.750 --> 06:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
um all
 
06:28:17.708 --> 06:28:17.718 align:start position:0%
of this is sort of the periphery the
 
06:28:19.468 --> 06:28:19.478 align:start position:0%
stuff that you're doing is sort of the
 
06:28:22.070 --> 06:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
periphery but when it actually gets to
 
06:28:25.030 --> 06:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
court and we have to worry about making
 
06:28:28.548 --> 06:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
sure that the court gets it right and
 
06:28:31.270 --> 06:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
that there's no that there's no uh
 
06:28:34.590 --> 06:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
errors in in what people testify about
 
06:28:36.150 --> 06:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
or that things that are supposed to be
 
06:28:38.548 --> 06:28:38.558 align:start position:0%
sealed in court are sealed and the ones
 
06:28:39.948 --> 06:28:39.958 align:start position:0%
that that stuff that's not supposed to
 
06:28:42.390 --> 06:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
be sealed is not supposed to be sealed
 
06:28:44.750 --> 06:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
all that is done by a
 
06:28:48.150 --> 06:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
non-licensed court monitor uh and yet
 
06:28:49.868 --> 06:28:49.878 align:start position:0%
the court system seems to have been
 
06:28:52.948 --> 06:28:52.958 align:start position:0%
doing that now for pretty close to 20
 
06:28:55.468 --> 06:28:55.478 align:start position:0%
years maybe more than 20 years uh and
 
06:28:59.390 --> 06:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
seems to be operating just fine um so I
 
06:29:02.708 --> 06:29:02.718 align:start position:0%
you know I I have to say I'm I'm a
 
06:29:06.070 --> 06:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
little bit skeptical that uh that lure
 
06:29:09.190 --> 06:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
is uh is such a critical thing for court
 
06:29:11.110 --> 06:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
reporters and and Court monitors like I
 
06:29:13.230 --> 06:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
said are monitored by the actual judge
 
06:29:16.310 --> 06:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
in the courtroom and the state has um
 
06:29:19.830 --> 06:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
government um contract with transcribers
 
06:29:21.270 --> 06:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
so they have oversight over the
 
06:29:23.628 --> 06:29:23.638 align:start position:0%
transcriptions of those Court
 
06:29:26.190 --> 06:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
recordings by done by the court monitor
 
06:29:28.708 --> 06:29:28.718 align:start position:0%
so if if somebody has a case in trial
 
06:29:30.750 --> 06:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
and they want to get a transcript for
 
06:29:33.788 --> 06:29:33.798 align:start position:0%
appeal um they'd have to go through the
 
06:29:36.230 --> 06:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
state contracted vendor to get a
 
06:29:38.350 --> 06:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
transcription so there's oversight even
 
06:29:40.468 --> 06:29:40.478 align:start position:0%
on that side what I was talking about
 
06:29:43.030 --> 06:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
and what my job is if if I'm not
 
06:29:44.868 --> 06:29:44.878 align:start position:0%
licensed and somebody comes into a
 
06:29:46.990 --> 06:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
deposition who's not licensed they're
 
06:29:49.830 --> 06:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
not held to any standards any ethical
 
06:29:52.590 --> 06:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
standards at all any procedural
 
06:29:56.390 --> 06:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
standards at all and I am
 
06:29:58.590 --> 06:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
and and why would you not be able to be
 
06:30:01.110 --> 06:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
held to standards by the the lawyers
 
06:30:04.548 --> 06:30:04.558 align:start position:0%
that hired you why I mean is it if if we
 
06:30:08.510 --> 06:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
if if your if court reporters weren't
 
06:30:11.910 --> 06:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
licensed um is it is it really fair to
 
06:30:14.830 --> 06:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
think that that the lawyers who employ
 
06:30:17.230 --> 06:30:17.240 align:start position:0%
who employ people to take records like
 
06:30:19.468 --> 06:30:19.478 align:start position:0%
you or maybe people who are who are just
 
06:30:22.150 --> 06:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
recording it uh How likely is it that
 
06:30:25.070 --> 06:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
you know that if if you are not doing a
 
06:30:26.788 --> 06:30:26.798 align:start position:0%
good job and you were getting things
 
06:30:29.270 --> 06:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
wrong that the lawyers that you'd be
 
06:30:32.390 --> 06:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
long long employed in that in that
 
06:30:33.990 --> 06:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
occupation whether you were licensed or
 
06:30:35.590 --> 06:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
not but how many mistakes would have to
 
06:30:37.388 --> 06:30:37.398 align:start position:0%
happen for them to learn
 
06:30:40.150 --> 06:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
that and so your your thought is that we
 
06:30:43.548 --> 06:30:43.558 align:start position:0%
would have to that in order to a to
 
06:30:47.150 --> 06:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
avoid that risk we should have this
 
06:30:50.190 --> 06:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
licensing system in place 100% for the
 
06:30:52.788 --> 06:30:52.798 align:start position:0%
citizens of this great state all right
 
06:30:54.868 --> 06:30:54.878 align:start position:0%
other questions yes Mr yes
 
06:30:56.270 --> 06:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
representative D Lorenzo thank you Mr
 
06:30:57.708 --> 06:30:57.718 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
06:31:00.628 --> 06:31:00.638 align:start position:0%
question um as far as your certification
 
06:31:04.430 --> 06:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
um are you administered an oath as part
 
06:31:06.430 --> 06:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
of you know being licensed I swear
 
06:31:08.750 --> 06:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
people in if that's what you're saying I
 
06:31:11.150 --> 06:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
I don't take an oath I I give an oath I
 
06:31:13.628 --> 06:31:13.638 align:start position:0%
administer an oath to Witnesses okay
 
06:31:15.868 --> 06:31:15.878 align:start position:0%
which is granted to me under the LCR as
 
06:31:18.030 --> 06:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
well so that's a I'm also a notary but I
 
06:31:20.030 --> 06:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
don't have to be a notary but that's not
 
06:31:21.990 --> 06:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
my question I'm I'm asking you if you
 
06:31:25.150 --> 06:31:25.160 align:start position:0%
are required to um take an oath of
 
06:31:28.190 --> 06:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
office uh with for confidentiality or
 
06:31:29.628 --> 06:31:29.638 align:start position:0%
anything like that nope that's just
 
06:31:31.350 --> 06:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
inherent in the rules of the ethical
 
06:31:33.190 --> 06:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
rules of following the state okay
 
06:31:34.830 --> 06:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines may I follow yes of course so
 
06:31:36.548 --> 06:31:36.558 align:start position:0%
then let's talk about the ethical rules
 
06:31:38.910 --> 06:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
those come from the state is that
 
06:31:41.830 --> 06:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
it that's part of the LCR what is the
 
06:31:43.948 --> 06:31:43.958 align:start position:0%
LCR the licensed court reporter that's
 
06:31:46.868 --> 06:31:46.878 align:start position:0%
the licensed court reporter so through
 
06:31:49.150 --> 06:31:49.160 align:start position:0%
the licensed court reporter organization
 
06:31:52.150 --> 06:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
whatever they are you take an oath of
 
06:31:54.990 --> 06:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
office I don't go somewhere like in in
 
06:31:56.750 --> 06:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
the notary office and raise my hand to
 
06:32:01.310 --> 06:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
do that all right I get that oh so I
 
06:32:03.788 --> 06:32:03.798 align:start position:0%
meant I didn't mean like o the I said
 
06:32:06.388 --> 06:32:06.398 align:start position:0%
this what about the um ethics that
 
06:32:10.350 --> 06:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
you're required to um subscribe to do
 
06:32:13.788 --> 06:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
you swear to um that's part of follow
 
06:32:15.868 --> 06:32:15.878 align:start position:0%
the ethical code yes it's it's part of
 
06:32:18.190 --> 06:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
the cope of um code of professional
 
06:32:21.030 --> 06:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
ethics okay that we follow it's called
 
06:32:23.990 --> 06:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
cope okay and follow up and that's not a
 
06:32:25.708 --> 06:32:25.718 align:start position:0%
government entity right that is a
 
06:32:28.070 --> 06:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
commercial entty they follow the
 
06:32:29.830 --> 06:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
national court reporters Association
 
06:32:31.708 --> 06:32:31.718 align:start position:0%
okay as well okay so they're a
 
06:32:34.468 --> 06:32:34.478 align:start position:0%
commercial rather than governmental yes
 
06:32:36.430 --> 06:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
okay they're private thank you all right
 
06:32:37.868 --> 06:32:37.878 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander please thank
 
06:32:39.190 --> 06:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
06:32:42.948 --> 06:32:42.958 align:start position:0%
question are you held liable for
 
06:32:44.788 --> 06:32:44.798 align:start position:0%
Distributing personal information
 
06:32:46.230 --> 06:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
whether you're licensed or not could you
 
06:32:49.510 --> 06:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
be held liable absolutely we oh sorry go
 
06:32:51.990 --> 06:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
ahead no I just I I guess I'm I'm a
 
06:32:54.310 --> 06:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
bartender by trade like I sling beers at
 
06:32:57.590 --> 06:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
night um Bud Lights whatever you know so
 
06:32:59.388 --> 06:32:59.398 align:start position:0%
um do you have any on you not not
 
06:33:03.510 --> 06:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
currently hopefully later so um my
 
06:33:07.990 --> 06:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
question is is I am not licensed at all
 
06:33:10.868 --> 06:33:10.878 align:start position:0%
I don't have to be licensed but I am
 
06:33:13.270 --> 06:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
liable so what you're saying is like the
 
06:33:14.910 --> 06:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
license is so important because you
 
06:33:16.430 --> 06:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
could you know share personal
 
06:33:18.788 --> 06:33:18.798 align:start position:0%
information or whatever but I'm liable
 
06:33:20.388 --> 06:33:20.398 align:start position:0%
if I serve somebody too many drinks and
 
06:33:22.548 --> 06:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
they drive so I guess I'm wondering is
 
06:33:26.310 --> 06:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
like how critical is the license itself
 
06:33:28.990 --> 06:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
to protecting the liability or personal
 
06:33:31.230 --> 06:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
information of the person you're you're
 
06:33:33.590 --> 06:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
taking a deposition from so you're
 
06:33:35.868 --> 06:33:35.878 align:start position:0%
comparing bartender to to court reporter
 
06:33:37.510 --> 06:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
well I'm I'm comparing an unlicensed
 
06:33:39.830 --> 06:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
position to a licensed position what's
 
06:33:41.510 --> 06:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
the difference between the two in the
 
06:33:44.310 --> 06:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
liability aspect there's no
 
06:33:46.750 --> 06:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
accountability to an unlicensed
 
06:33:48.708 --> 06:33:48.718 align:start position:0%
person there there's no we have a
 
06:33:50.948 --> 06:33:50.958 align:start position:0%
assurity bond that we have to carry as
 
06:33:54.990 --> 06:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
part of our LCR that protects us um so
 
06:33:57.110 --> 06:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm so to follow up I think I think
 
06:33:58.990 --> 06:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
I got a contradiction because I heard
 
06:34:01.590 --> 06:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
once that you are liable if you share
 
06:34:02.830 --> 06:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
somebody's personal information if
 
06:34:05.150 --> 06:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
you're not licensed you're still liable
 
06:34:06.830 --> 06:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
for sharing personal information oh if
 
06:34:09.030 --> 06:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
that's how what I answered I apologize I
 
06:34:11.628 --> 06:34:11.638 align:start position:0%
I if you're not licensed what what's the
 
06:34:13.388 --> 06:34:13.398 align:start position:0%
recourse they'd have to sue me
 
06:34:15.510 --> 06:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
personally I
 
06:34:17.910 --> 06:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
guess okay I just wouldn't be held to a
 
06:34:19.510 --> 06:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
governmental standard and and wouldn't
 
06:34:21.350 --> 06:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
be reprimanded wouldn't lose my lure
 
06:34:22.548 --> 06:34:22.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't lose my
 
06:34:24.270 --> 06:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
certifications all those things that I
 
06:34:27.750 --> 06:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
hold deer in doing my job okay right
 
06:34:27.760 --> 06:34:29.830 align:start position:0%
hold deer in doing my job okay right
representative

06:34:29.830 --> 06:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:34:33.110 --> 06:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
ston do you carry uh professional
 
06:34:33.120 --> 06:34:35.190 align:start position:0%
ston do you carry uh professional
liability

06:34:35.190 --> 06:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
liability
 
06:34:38.548 --> 06:34:38.558 align:start position:0%
insurance we are available we can get um
 
06:34:40.788 --> 06:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
Eno insurance but we it's covered under
 
06:34:41.830 --> 06:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
our shity
 
06:34:46.388 --> 06:34:46.398 align:start position:0%
bond that we're required to have and um
 
06:34:48.910 --> 06:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
to get that you know professional
 
06:34:51.788 --> 06:34:51.798 align:start position:0%
liability must you be licensed according
 
06:34:54.590 --> 06:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
to the insurance company's uh provisions
 
06:34:57.230 --> 06:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
on the policy issue I am unsure of that
 
06:34:59.430 --> 06:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
question I know that I get the shity
 
06:35:00.990 --> 06:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
bond because I'm
 
06:35:02.750 --> 06:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
licensed thank

you representative
 
06:35:08.628 --> 06:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
K is there something in the licensing
 
06:35:11.910 --> 06:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
rules that somewhere states
 
06:35:15.270 --> 06:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
that you're only liable up to the $1,000
 
06:35:17.468 --> 06:35:17.478 align:start position:0%

06:35:51.468 --> 06:35:51.478 align:start position:0%
long history together going back uh many
 
06:35:54.070 --> 06:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
years uh I am proud to be New Hampshire
 
06:35:57.190 --> 06:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
Li since court reporter number 61 and I
 
06:35:59.750 --> 06:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
live in Northampton New Hampshire on the
 
06:36:02.868 --> 06:36:02.878 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast which was a lot warmer than up
 
06:36:05.670 --> 06:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
here little 48 degrees before I hit the
 
06:36:09.310 --> 06:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
road to come here today um Katherine
 
06:36:12.670 --> 06:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
deferred a few questions to me and uh
 
06:36:14.590 --> 06:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
there are some other things I'd like to
 
06:36:16.468 --> 06:36:16.478 align:start position:0%
mention as well but let me start with
 
06:36:19.030 --> 06:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
the last one the shity bond question uh
 
06:36:21.150 --> 06:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
representative um it is
 
06:36:24.270 --> 06:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
$1,000 and there is no higher limit that
 
06:36:26.030 --> 06:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
we're required to get pursuant to our
 
06:36:29.230 --> 06:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
licensure with the RSA uh I suppose we
 
06:36:33.070 --> 06:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
could um I personally do not carry uh
 
06:36:35.350 --> 06:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
professional liability insurance Eno
 
06:36:39.670 --> 06:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
insurance I never have uh I I never saw
 
06:36:41.708 --> 06:36:41.718 align:start position:0%
the need for it and nobody's ever come
 
06:36:44.868 --> 06:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
after me about any bad transcripts or
 
06:36:48.270 --> 06:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
omissions or acts that I've done so um
 
06:36:49.510 --> 06:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's the answer to that question as
 
06:36:51.788 --> 06:36:51.798 align:start position:0%
far as the amount that's required by the
 
06:36:54.788 --> 06:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
RSA um the code of ethics
 
06:36:56.430 --> 06:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
06:36:59.670 --> 06:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
dorenzo uh the code of ethics in the RSA
 
06:37:01.628 --> 06:37:01.638 align:start position:0%
is tied to the code of ethics of the
 
06:37:03.350 --> 06:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
national Cory Porters
 
06:37:07.230 --> 06:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
Association so they go to each other if
 
06:37:09.830 --> 06:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
we eliminate lure that code of ethics
 
06:37:13.788 --> 06:37:13.798 align:start position:0%
goes away if we eliminate lure the shity
 
06:37:18.070 --> 06:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
bond goes away if we eliminate lure the
 
06:37:20.030 --> 06:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
requirement for continuing education
 
06:37:23.990 --> 06:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
units which is 10 units 10 hours a year
 
06:37:27.590 --> 06:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
go goes away um I will say this I think
 
06:37:30.910 --> 06:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
the greatest deterrent against unethical
 
06:37:33.270 --> 06:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
maybe even illegal acts by practitioners
 
06:37:35.788 --> 06:37:35.798 align:start position:0%
in any profession is the possibility of
 
06:37:38.310 --> 06:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
losing one's license and not being able
 
06:37:41.990 --> 06:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
to work are you not better drivers
 
06:37:43.830 --> 06:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
because you were licensed to
 
06:37:46.708 --> 06:37:46.718 align:start position:0%
drive would you go through that red
 
06:37:50.830 --> 06:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
arrow and make an illegal act knowing
 
06:37:52.350 --> 06:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
that you're going to luse your license
 
06:37:54.910 --> 06:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
if you do so and get caught you probably
 
06:37:58.868 --> 06:37:58.878 align:start position:0%
don't so I I ask you to consider that
 
06:38:00.468 --> 06:38:00.478 align:start position:0%
and you I know that you think is the
 
06:38:02.910 --> 06:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
national certification enough and why
 
06:38:04.830 --> 06:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
should the state of New Hampshire be
 
06:38:06.990 --> 06:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
involved be further involved continue to
 
06:38:09.110 --> 06:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
be involved the marketplace will sort
 
06:38:11.590 --> 06:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
out who's good and who's bad I would ask
 
06:38:14.150 --> 06:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
you to also think about not just the
 
06:38:16.070 --> 06:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
lawyers that we work with on a daily
 
06:38:18.310 --> 06:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
basis but prosay
 
06:38:20.510 --> 06:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
litigants I I'm doing a prosay
 
06:38:22.868 --> 06:38:22.878 align:start position:0%
deposition next week these are folks
 
06:38:24.830 --> 06:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
that um judge Lin will tell tell you
 
06:38:28.070 --> 06:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
represent themselves in civil courts and
 
06:38:30.670 --> 06:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
even criminal courts and I have a
 
06:38:32.590 --> 06:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
deposition next week and it's a prosay
 
06:38:34.868 --> 06:38:34.878 align:start position:0%
person who is suing their veterinarian
 
06:38:36.590 --> 06:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
for medical
 
06:38:40.868 --> 06:38:40.878 align:start position:0%
negligence so I have to be absolutely
 
06:38:43.548 --> 06:38:43.558 align:start position:0%
impartial not even the imper of
 
06:38:45.948 --> 06:38:45.958 align:start position:0%
impropriety dealing and judge you know
 
06:38:50.030 --> 06:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
how difficult prosay litigant can be um
 
06:38:51.590 --> 06:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
and they're filling the courts more and
 
06:38:54.190 --> 06:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
more so it's not just the lawyers that
 
06:38:55.948 --> 06:38:55.958 align:start position:0%
have to pick the court reporters it's
 
06:38:59.510 --> 06:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
also individual litigant pray
 
06:39:02.190 --> 06:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
litigant and so more
 
06:39:05.270 --> 06:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
things uh the lack of complaints against
 
06:39:08.910 --> 06:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
practitioners we say yeah whoooo that's
 
06:39:10.948 --> 06:39:10.958 align:start position:0%
because we do all the things that I've
 
06:39:14.150 --> 06:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned the cus the ethics and I'll
 
06:39:16.548 --> 06:39:16.558 align:start position:0%
tell you with artificial intelligence
 
06:39:18.708 --> 06:39:18.718 align:start position:0%
got mentioned just briefly but our
 
06:39:20.510 --> 06:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
National Association and I'll make sure
 
06:39:23.350 --> 06:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
that all you folks get this has issued a
 
06:39:24.590 --> 06:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
white paper
 
06:39:27.468 --> 06:39:27.478 align:start position:0%
about the effect of AI in the in the
 
06:39:29.270 --> 06:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
judicial system I'll make sure you all
 
06:39:32.030 --> 06:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
get a copy of this this is very scary
 
06:39:36.030 --> 06:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
stuff that's happening um our
 
06:39:39.388 --> 06:39:39.398 align:start position:0%
CEUs we Embrace learning new stuff we
 
06:39:41.350 --> 06:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
love to learn new stuff not just
 
06:39:43.270 --> 06:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
technology stuff as far as our sto
 
06:39:45.190 --> 06:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
machines and software but we are
 
06:39:48.788 --> 06:39:48.798 align:start position:0%
learning about AI cloud storage issues
 
06:39:51.628 --> 06:39:51.638 align:start position:0%
data breaches and as court reporters on
 
06:39:54.070 --> 06:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
a daily basis when we're in very highly
 
06:39:57.468 --> 06:39:57.478 align:start position:0%
sensitive depositions we have to sign
 
06:39:59.510 --> 06:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
non-confidentiality agreements
 
06:40:01.670 --> 06:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreements we have to
 
06:40:03.948 --> 06:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
sign on to protective orders a
 
06:40:06.030 --> 06:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
protective order means that we cannot
 
06:40:08.750 --> 06:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
talk about let anything come out that
 
06:40:11.230 --> 06:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
was a document and exhibit a trade
 
06:40:13.030 --> 06:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
secret all the information that
 
06:40:14.948 --> 06:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
Katherine mentioned we are privy to
 
06:40:17.468 --> 06:40:17.478 align:start position:0%
Social Security numbers birth dates
 
06:40:19.750 --> 06:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
mother's maiden names and when the
 
06:40:22.230 --> 06:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys start to go down that road and
 
06:40:24.430 --> 06:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
and ask somebody their name their
 
06:40:26.750 --> 06:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
address and then they hit the birth date
 
06:40:28.110 --> 06:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
and then they they want the social
 
06:40:29.868 --> 06:40:29.878 align:start position:0%
security number it's us as court
 
06:40:31.948 --> 06:40:31.958 align:start position:0%
reporters that say councel could we
 
06:40:34.190 --> 06:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
please stop and go off the Record
 
06:40:36.270 --> 06:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
because that is going to violate a
 
06:40:38.990 --> 06:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
person's personal identify personally
 
06:40:42.430 --> 06:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
identifiable information and the lawyers
 
06:40:44.468 --> 06:40:44.478 align:start position:0%
are learning they go off the Record they
 
06:40:46.590 --> 06:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
get the Social Security while we're off
 
06:40:48.310 --> 06:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
the Record so it's not in our
 
06:40:50.388 --> 06:40:50.398 align:start position:0%
transcripts and then they go back on the
 
06:40:52.628 --> 06:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
record they write it down somewhere but
 
06:40:54.990 --> 06:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
that that combination of information as
 
06:40:57.110 --> 06:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
you know can lead to data breaches and
 
06:41:00.830 --> 06:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
personal uh identity theft so those are
 
06:41:03.388 --> 06:41:03.398 align:start position:0%
things to consider um you haven't
 
06:41:06.430 --> 06:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
brought up some things but uh I I think
 
06:41:08.990 --> 06:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
we're so far over time I I just would
 
06:41:11.548 --> 06:41:11.558 align:start position:0%
not answer any questions you want
 
06:41:12.948 --> 06:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
06:41:15.708 --> 06:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative
 
06:41:17.868 --> 06:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:41:20.628 --> 06:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um so when
 
06:41:22.270 --> 06:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the national court
 
06:41:24.388 --> 06:41:24.398 align:start position:0%
reporters Association we website I'm
 
06:41:27.670 --> 06:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
just I'm trying to differentiate I guess
 
06:41:31.708 --> 06:41:31.718 align:start position:0%
what the difference between the NC is
 
06:41:32.910 --> 06:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
and the difference between the New
 
06:41:35.070 --> 06:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm just I'm not understanding
 
06:41:36.150 --> 06:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
why you need the New Hampshire
 
06:41:37.948 --> 06:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
certification when I'm seeing on there
 
06:41:40.270 --> 06:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
that they do require a certain number of
 
06:41:42.670 --> 06:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
continuing add-on here and that there is
 
06:41:45.388 --> 06:41:45.398 align:start position:0%
a process uh for filing a complaint
 
06:41:47.310 --> 06:41:47.320 align:start position:0%
against the member of the association
 
06:41:49.388 --> 06:41:49.398 align:start position:0%
could the RSA just not state that a
 
06:41:52.270 --> 06:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
court reporter has to be certified by
 
06:41:54.628 --> 06:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
the NC and then just eliminate the
 
06:41:56.948 --> 06:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
license couldn't the statute just simply
 
06:41:58.548 --> 06:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
be amended that you have to be a member
 
06:42:00.388 --> 06:42:00.398 align:start position:0%
of this National Organization in good
 
06:42:03.150 --> 06:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
standing I don't think you can force
 
06:42:05.430 --> 06:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
membership and a voluntary membership
 
06:42:08.468 --> 06:42:08.478 align:start position:0%
organization and there are
 
06:42:10.628 --> 06:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
lenses that are I don't know about that
 
06:42:12.628 --> 06:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
I mean the bar is a is a private
 
06:42:14.708 --> 06:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
organization and we force attorneys to
 
06:42:16.350 --> 06:42:16.360 align:start position:0%
be members of
 
06:42:21.030 --> 06:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
that excuse me um um with all due
 
06:42:24.990 --> 06:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
respect the bar is a holy own subsidiary
 
06:42:27.990 --> 06:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
of the Supreme Court it is not an
 
06:42:31.150 --> 06:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
independent body we're we're one of we
 
06:42:33.388 --> 06:42:33.398 align:start position:0%
are one of it's called unified bar
 
06:42:35.510 --> 06:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
unified bar we are we are I think
 
06:42:36.990 --> 06:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
there's a minority of states that have
 
06:42:38.788 --> 06:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
unified bars but we are one of them
 
06:42:41.150 --> 06:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is not for example but in
 
06:42:42.468 --> 06:42:42.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if you want to practice
 
06:42:44.468 --> 06:42:44.478 align:start position:0%
law you have to be a member of the of
 
06:42:46.230 --> 06:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
the bar but okay but in so in
 
06:42:47.910 --> 06:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it's privately owned and
 
06:42:49.868 --> 06:42:49.878 align:start position:0%
to be a mass attorney you have to be a
 
06:42:51.388 --> 06:42:51.398 align:start position:0%
member of the bar right right but you
 
06:42:52.388 --> 06:42:52.398 align:start position:0%
don't have to be a member of the bar
 
06:42:54.310 --> 06:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
association you don't have to be
 
06:42:57.070 --> 06:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
Association that's
 
06:43:00.190 --> 06:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the question other
 
06:43:00.200 --> 06:43:01.430 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the question other
other

06:43:01.430 --> 06:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:43:04.750 --> 06:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative tur please
 
06:43:07.590 --> 06:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh just in in the in the broader sense
 
06:43:09.430 --> 06:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
um your
 
06:43:13.270 --> 06:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
Association consists completely of um
 
06:43:15.990 --> 06:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
licensed court reporters is that right
 
06:43:18.190 --> 06:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
is there I I guess what I'm what I'm
 
06:43:20.190 --> 06:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
wondering is do you have the the
 
06:43:22.388 --> 06:43:22.398 align:start position:0%
knowledge of is is essentially everyone
 
06:43:25.948 --> 06:43:25.958 align:start position:0%
impacted by this this um uh potential
 
06:43:28.350 --> 06:43:28.360 align:start position:0%
withdrawal of a license supportive of
 
06:43:30.910 --> 06:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
the license the way that it currently
 
06:43:35.150 --> 06:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
exists at least as as as sort of your
 
06:43:38.270 --> 06:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
organization um promotes that oh to
 
06:43:39.910 --> 06:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
answer your question we have also
 
06:43:42.388 --> 06:43:42.398 align:start position:0%
retired members and we also have a
 
06:43:45.830 --> 06:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
student member uh because uh student
 
06:43:48.190 --> 06:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
we're doing some great work on the local
 
06:43:50.590 --> 06:43:50.600 align:start position:0%
and National level of recruiting and
 
06:43:53.350 --> 06:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
training court reporters for the future
 
06:43:55.030 --> 06:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
and so it's not just licensed court
 
06:43:56.628 --> 06:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
reporters but we have retired members
 
06:43:57.868 --> 06:43:57.878 align:start position:0%
and a student member and we have an
 
06:44:00.070 --> 06:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
associate member or two these are people
 
06:44:03.030 --> 06:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
that proof read like for instance I am
 
06:44:05.510 --> 06:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
use a a proofreader that I give a 1099
 
06:44:08.468 --> 06:44:08.478 align:start position:0%
to every year and uh I she proofreads
 
06:44:10.670 --> 06:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
every transcript of mine so after I
 
06:44:13.230 --> 06:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
finish producing the transcript I proof
 
06:44:15.750 --> 06:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
freed it myself but we all know how many
 
06:44:18.910 --> 06:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
times we Blow by our own errors so I pay
 
06:44:20.990 --> 06:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
an outside person who is a retired
 
06:44:22.750 --> 06:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
licensed court reporter and she proof
 
06:44:24.190 --> 06:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
freed all my work
 
06:44:25.868 --> 06:44:25.878 align:start position:0%
can I just just one quick follow of
 
06:44:28.708 --> 06:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
course uh thanks that that's helpful so
 
06:44:30.830 --> 06:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
so in your knowledge there's nobody sort
 
06:44:33.670 --> 06:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
of within your Association asking to

1976 and I graduated from college in
 
06:45:24.190 --> 06:45:24.200 align:start position:0%

Bay Community College in Massachusetts
 
06:45:30.948 --> 06:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
where I'm originally from um so
 
06:45:34.350 --> 06:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
obviously you know I am now 65 years old
 
06:45:36.350 --> 06:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
or I was a child prodigy cour reporter
 
06:45:38.910 --> 06:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
one or the other so I've been doing this
 
06:45:42.270 --> 06:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
47 years and I still love it and uh just
 
06:45:43.788 --> 06:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
got my Medicare card and I'm still
 
06:45:45.350 --> 06:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
working because that's how much I love
 
06:45:47.670 --> 06:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
this job I love this profession I love
 
06:45:49.948 --> 06:45:49.958 align:start position:0%
this career but it's a 2-year generally
 
06:45:52.150 --> 06:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
a 2-year program some people want to go
 
06:45:54.868 --> 06:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
four years and get a bachelor's degree U
 
06:45:56.948 --> 06:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
some people do it private training
 
06:45:56.958 --> 06:45:57.750 align:start position:0%
some people do it private training
through

06:45:57.750 --> 06:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
through
 
06:45:59.868 --> 06:45:59.878 align:start position:0%
individuals uh and there are some very
 
06:46:03.230 --> 06:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
talented natural Steno writers out there
 
06:46:04.670 --> 06:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
that can complete a course in much
 
06:46:06.708 --> 06:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
shorter time but I wanted to get my
 
06:46:08.830 --> 06:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
associates degree and have that degree
 
06:46:11.150 --> 06:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
so I did a full curriculum for two
 
06:46:15.868 --> 06:46:15.878 align:start position:0%
years y other questions for this witness
 
06:46:17.510 --> 06:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
06:46:19.070 --> 06:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
you jine thank
 
06:46:21.468 --> 06:46:21.478 align:start position:0%
you uh is there anyone else who wishes
 
06:46:27.310 --> 06:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:29.708 --> 06:46:29.718 align:start position:0%
1412 of course representative leakas
 
06:46:33.190 --> 06:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:35.548 --> 06:46:35.558 align:start position:0%
up um this addresses the question of
 
06:46:37.030 --> 06:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
whether the state can require somebody
 
06:46:39.430 --> 06:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
of a member of a private organization
 
06:46:41.430 --> 06:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
currently in order to get a license uh
 
06:46:43.628 --> 06:46:43.638 align:start position:0%
to become a court reporter you are
 
06:46:45.628 --> 06:46:45.638 align:start position:0%
required to join at least one of the two
 
06:46:46.910 --> 06:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
organizations that are on the
 
06:46:48.910 --> 06:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
application you have there so that's
 
06:46:53.750 --> 06:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
currently law and uh and if if the
 
06:46:55.070 --> 06:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
committee I don't think there's a need
 
06:46:56.788 --> 06:46:56.798 align:start position:0%
for the license the people employing
 
06:46:58.990 --> 06:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
them can require the certification but
 
06:47:01.628 --> 06:47:01.638 align:start position:0%
if the committee felt more comfortable
 
06:47:03.350 --> 06:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh just saying if you're going to uh
 
06:47:04.948 --> 06:47:04.958 align:start position:0%
practice as a court reporter you have to
 
06:47:06.468 --> 06:47:06.478 align:start position:0%
have one of these certifications of
 
06:47:08.948 --> 06:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
course that that would be not
 
06:47:12.070 --> 06:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
unreasonable thing to do thank
 
06:47:16.510 --> 06:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
you yes um I'm sorry please if you had a
 
06:47:20.030 --> 06:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
response to that go happy to hear
 
06:47:23.868 --> 06:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
it yes thank you so much um I think
 
06:47:25.190 --> 06:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative Lea said that we're
 
06:47:27.230 --> 06:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
required to be members of Our National
 
06:47:29.670 --> 06:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
Association that actually is not the
 
06:47:31.788 --> 06:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
case um there are licensed court
 
06:47:33.310 --> 06:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
reporters who are not members of Our
 
06:47:37.468 --> 06:47:37.478 align:start position:0%
National Association they got their lure
 
06:47:39.070 --> 06:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
either through the grandfathering from
 
06:47:42.190 --> 06:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
decades ago or because they came here
 
06:47:44.030 --> 06:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
from another state and had licensed from
 
06:47:46.270 --> 06:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
another state and held the What's called
 
06:47:48.670 --> 06:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
the registered professional reporter
 
06:47:49.910 --> 06:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
designation from our National
 
06:47:53.388 --> 06:47:53.398 align:start position:0%
Association called the rpr but our RSA
 
06:47:56.070 --> 06:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
currently you have to have the rpr to
 
06:47:58.310 --> 06:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
apply and get your license here but you
 
06:48:00.388 --> 06:48:00.398 align:start position:0%
do not have to maintain that status
 
06:48:01.990 --> 06:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
after you get your license
 
06:48:04.430 --> 06:48:04.440 align:start position:0%

record um I I ran into uh uh I believe
 
06:49:11.070 --> 06:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
it was representative to trer who was uh
 
06:49:13.190 --> 06:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
I think in involved in some other she
 
06:49:15.070 --> 06:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
who who had some other business here
 
06:49:17.910 --> 06:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
today was not able to be here but who
 
06:49:20.270 --> 06:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
who basically who told me the same thing
 
06:49:23.830 --> 06:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
um and I had a discussion with uh
 
06:49:28.868 --> 06:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
with uh him last evening uh about the
 
06:49:31.110 --> 06:49:31.120 align:start position:0%

06:49:32.868 --> 06:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
personally that I had some reservations
 
06:49:36.070 --> 06:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
about the the uh the idea of having a
 
06:49:38.750 --> 06:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
police officer be able to uh practice
 
06:49:41.388 --> 06:49:41.398 align:start position:0%
law uh other than maybe as a prosecutor
 
06:49:44.110 --> 06:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
and and I think he he he would sort of
 
06:49:45.990 --> 06:49:46.000 align:start position:0%

06:49:49.388 --> 06:49:49.398 align:start position:0%
was going to ask that the billb itl um
 
06:49:51.510 --> 06:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
so in light of that um and in the
 
06:49:54.468 --> 06:49:54.478 align:start position:0%
