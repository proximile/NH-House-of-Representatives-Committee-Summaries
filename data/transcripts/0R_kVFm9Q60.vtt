bill
 
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman thank
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
you my name is uh Mark PR representing
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 15 which is Manchester Ward 8
 
00:19:41.549 --> 00:19:41.559 align:start position:0%
this morning I'm uh introducing House
 
00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:43.029 align:start position:0%
this morning I'm uh introducing House
Bill

00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
1051 which
 
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
prohibits uh restaurants
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
from holding wages or making the weight
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
staff pay a bill of someone who scoots
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
out without paying
 
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
um I've heard this from a couple
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
different people that they've had to pay
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
past uh
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that's really a good
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
thing to be happening because they have
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
no control over that if somebody gets up
 
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
and walks out they can't tackle them
 
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
they you know they can call the police
 
00:20:21.549 --> 00:20:21.559 align:start position:0%
but they'll be long gone by that time by
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
the time they get there so I don't think
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
it's fair for them to have to pay for
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
somebody that gets up and
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
um to me this is a pretty simple thing
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
um from what I
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
understand uh there's nothing in a law
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
that says they can but there's nothing
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
that says they can't so they
 
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
do and with that I'll I'll take any
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
questions and try to answer them to the
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
best of my knowledge all right thank you
 
00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:57.039 align:start position:0%
are there questions for the sponsor
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%

other business sector that requires

their emplo or maybe not so much
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
requires but does have their employees
 
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.360 align:start position:0%

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
happened matter of fact uh I was eating

dinner one evening and somebody and I

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
practice there and then I kind of
 
00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:54.039 align:start position:0%
started asking around and I've heard of
 
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
it at a couple of different people
 
00:21:59.950 --> 00:21:59.960 align:start position:0%

have insurance to cover such
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
losses I have no idea I I think I see
 
00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:13.960 align:start position:0%

okay further questions representative on
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
line Thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
representative PR um so if you have an
 
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
employee whose friends come in skip out
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
on a bill and the employee comes back
 
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
and tells you hey you know what these
 
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
people just left and unb knowings to the
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
owner that it was their friends
 
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
shouldn't there be some mechanism in
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
there to hold these people accountable
 
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
police but how would he how would he
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
even find out that they're they're
 
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
friends and I I I I understand what
 
00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
00:22:51.549 --> 00:22:51.559 align:start position:0%
but I think if that happened more than
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
once then the account would be out of
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
the bag but still breaking the law right
 
00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
the friends skip out
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to be happy with my
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
friends if I have to pay for it that's
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
for sure cor and what about the business
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
owner would he follow Mr chairman follow
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
up would the bu should the business
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
well so you're talking about one little
 
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
piece of a bigger picture right
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
so if the business owner can have the
 
00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
police investigate and if they have an
 
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
idea that it's their friend I'm sure
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
they can find out who those people are
 
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
thinkk thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
Mr representative Pro representative C
 
00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:43.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh representative
 
00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
Pro if if I worked at Macy's and I had
 
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
friends come in and they stole clothes
 
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
and they left would it be reasonable to
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
expect that I would be paying for their
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
clothes that they stole no cuz I'd be
 
00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
calling police on my friends that are
 
00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
going to jam me up thank you thank
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony thank you I have
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
a card uh from Tracy McGraw from the
 
00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor anticipating that we
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
may have some questions about the
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
law good morning my name is Tracy mcra
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney in legislative leaon for
 
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor and um I gave
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
you that card primarily
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that a law does
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
exist and it is under
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
27548 and it is not specific to
 
00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
restaurant employees it is in general to
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
all employees that if an employer is
 
00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
going to deduct anything from an
 
00:24:56.389 --> 00:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
employee there has to be an
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
agreement it has to be signed by the
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
employee there has to be a determination
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
of whether it's going to be a gradual
 
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
deduction another's over a period of
 
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
time depending upon the amount or if
 
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to be paid at termination but
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is is there is a law in
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
there so there's nothing actually it
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
would actually be employee theft of by
 
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
the employer if they took money from any
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
of their weights any of their employ
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
simply to cover a tab that somebody
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
walked out on um so it's already in the
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
law and in fact this actual section is
 
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
to be put under 1A 1- a as the new
 
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
section and it's actually in
 
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.830 align:start position:0%
section and it's actually in
27548

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
27548
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
already um as to the question with
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
regards to what does the employer have
 
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
as uh recourse if a friend of of a
 
00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
server walks in and they they either
 
00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:00.039 align:start position:0%
bail on the check and maybe the server's
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
involved in it maybe the server's not
 
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
involved in it that's a case for
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
criminal court for Superior Court for uh
 
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
restitution for reimbursement for
 
00:26:15.149 --> 00:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
Recovery uh but that is nothing that's
 
00:26:17.789 --> 00:26:17.799 align:start position:0%
needed underneath the department of
 
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
labor laws all right thank you um are
 
00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:22.919 align:start position:0%
you aware of
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
any restaurant employees weight staff
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
that have made complaint to the
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor that they have been
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
had something deducted from their I
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
asked before I came the answer was no
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
all right thank you further questions
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative kahill thank you Mr chair
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
and thank you Miss mcra um I'm
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
interested in the response you just gave
 
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
to that question and I wonder if perhaps
 
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
the employees don't know their rights
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
and that this is actually illegal and
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
that the Restaurant Association might
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
include this kind of information what
 
00:27:00.269 --> 00:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
the rules are as they are providing the
 
00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
information for tipped tipped wages
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
tipped employees what their rules and
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
practices are that uh that you're not
 
00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
responsible if somebody comes in and
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
stiffs you I wouldn't argue with that
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you further questions
 
00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.470 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you further questions
representative

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
Sullivan um thank you for taking my
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um the
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
um If an employer had a policy that uh
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
emplo that the weight staff had to pay
 
00:27:32.039 --> 00:27:33.389 align:start position:0%
emplo that the weight staff had to pay
for

00:27:33.389 --> 00:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
these um uh checks that were skipped out
 
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
on um and they made the employees aware
 
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
of that policy upon hire could that be
 
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:45.799 align:start position:0%
viewed as an agre I mean you take the
 
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
job you live with our policies could
 
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
that be viewed as an agreement between
 
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
the employer and employee that they
 
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
would be stuck with the with the um
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
Bill if the employer had that policy and
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
they presented it to an employee um
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
either after hiring or before hiring if
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
that employee signed off on that policy
 
00:28:09.549 --> 00:28:09.559 align:start position:0%
I think the employer would have a better
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
argument but the bottom line is is that
 
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
the statute requires the employee to
 
00:28:17.549 --> 00:28:17.559 align:start position:0%
agree on any deduction and must sign off
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.070 align:start position:0%
on that
deduction

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
deduction
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
follow and and so essentially the way
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
that the um statute reads is that each
 
00:28:30.029 --> 00:28:30.039 align:start position:0%
time that there's going to be
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
um a deduction of this nature they would
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
have to sign off on each one it doesn't
 
00:28:37.389 --> 00:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
specifically State each time but the
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation for the Department of
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
Labor would be if there is any deduction
 
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
to be made from a paycheck normally it
 
00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:46.519 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be all five at one time so if
 
00:28:48.029 --> 00:28:48.039 align:start position:0%
there are five different deductions that
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
need to be made there need to be five
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
different writings with signatur from
 
00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:52.310 align:start position:0%
different writings with signatur from
the

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
employee thank you um if I may follow up
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
on that if I recall the language of this
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
statute it is written to be restrictive
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
in other words the assumption is that an
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
employer cannot take out of the
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
employees paycheck except under certain
 
00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:16.039 align:start position:0%
narrow conditions and to me that's part
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
of what you're explaining here is that
 
00:29:22.509 --> 00:29:22.519 align:start position:0%
it's not simply a matter of an employer
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
writing a policy and saying I'm going to
 
00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:27.799 align:start position:0%
take stuff from you am I spot on thank
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
you uh representative kill thank you Mr
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
chair um when we're talking about
 
00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559 align:start position:0%
withholding with deducting from wages
 
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
are we talking about the tipped minimum
 
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
wage that the employer pays or the tips
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
that they're divied up at the end of the
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.549 --> 00:29:51.559 align:start position:0%
share I'm not 100% sure that I
 
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
understand the question we talking about
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
here about people who are skipping out
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
and on this particular bill so if you
 
00:30:00.029 --> 00:30:00.039 align:start position:0%
could give me a little bit more detail I
 
00:30:02.909 --> 00:30:02.919 align:start position:0%
can try let's let's just say that uh the
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
server has had this p a table walk out
 
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
this $200 Tab and they they've walked
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
out uh does when the employer does will
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
the employer say okay when I give you
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
your paycheck which sometimes has zero
 
00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
at the end uh will will I be deducting
 
00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:21.519 align:start position:0%
it from that or will I the end of this
 
00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:24.519 align:start position:0%
shift where I take out your tips and say
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
well you're you owe me for this table
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
that's that's ski out and I might have
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
to take out the next time you work too
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
okay so you're talking about a single
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
employee whose table walked out and an
 
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
employer possibly reducing that
 
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
employees tips correct okay same issue
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
they cannot that's their money that's
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
their wages and although they're
 
00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:47.799 align:start position:0%
calculated and they're done differently
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
in in various establishments those are
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
still wages and the employer is not
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
allowed to take them without a signed
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
document thank you very
 
00:31:02.629 --> 00:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
much further questions representative
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
McKenzie uh thank you Mr
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
chairman if I understand the where we're
 
00:31:11.549 --> 00:31:11.559 align:start position:0%
going with this legislation is that the
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
sponsor wants to make it illegal for the
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
employers to deduct money that's stolen
 
00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
from uh from a restaurant and so at
 
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
least that's what I so we don't want
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to allow the practice
 
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
at all whether they sign or not that
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
employee should not uh have to pay if
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
somebody steals something out of the
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
restaurant and if I understand the
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
nature of the of the uh what the intent
 
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:39.559 align:start position:0%
of the legislation that this is the
 
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
intent of the legislation to say no
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
whether the employee agrees to it or not
 
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know what employee would agree
 
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
to it but regardless of that it's the
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
idea that somebody's stealing something
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
and the employee is in any way
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
responsible for that so I think that's
 
00:31:57.389 --> 00:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
what that's what I understand to the
 
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
legislation okay as far as the intent I
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm assuming that's exactly where it
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
was going but the law already covers it
 
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
so if an employer comes in and says okay
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh Miss Smith your table walked out on
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
you there's $200 that you now owe me
 
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
even if they say you must sign this
 
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
document because it was your table they
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
need to be educated that they don't have
 
00:32:27.149 --> 00:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
to sign that document it has to be an
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
agreement not a
 
00:32:32.669 --> 00:32:32.679 align:start position:0%
forced uh issue and if they don't sign
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
the document then the employer is not
 
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
wages so by touching their wages that
 
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
would be a violation of the law which
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
pretty much goes down what I think the
 
00:32:51.789 --> 00:32:51.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
is further
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative d sylvestro
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
I thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:33:01.629 --> 00:33:01.639 align:start position:0%
question you said earlier that you had
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
no reports of this and you're saying um
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
I think now that an employer might force
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
or not explain that situation so
 
00:33:12.629 --> 00:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
therefore an employee would not
 
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:14.919 align:start position:0%
necessarily call the Department of Labor
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
in your opinion because they're afraid
 
00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
of retaliation so you may not have any
 
00:33:22.269 --> 00:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
reports I don't want to speculate on
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
that but the bottom line is is I think
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
that that is I think that's a fair state
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
to say but I also think that the key to
 
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
all of this is
 
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
education what we tell employees we have
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
all of these placards that are required
 
00:33:42.269 --> 00:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
to be uh hung at a business and it says
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
in other applicable laws we don't have
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
every single employment related law hung
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
up at a business you'd need an entire
 
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
office space for
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
that so employees need to be educated
 
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
and that employers also need to be
 
00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:00.039 align:start position:0%
educated because it could very well be a
 
00:34:00.039 --> 00:34:01.710 align:start position:0%
educated because it could very well be a
mistaken

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
mistaken
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
expectation of an employee having to pay
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
for uh a table that walks out so this is
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
not on one side or the other this is
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
just purely
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
education and then the Department of
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
Labor if they get a claim for it um they
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
resource did that answer your question
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
yeah okay would you have a
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
concern given that you've explained this
 
00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
would already be
 
00:34:39.149 --> 00:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
illegal that by itemizing specific cases
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
where it's illegal
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
might have uh effects of other cases
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
where it's also illegal but since we
 
00:34:51.149 --> 00:34:51.159 align:start position:0%
didn't specifically call it out it might
 
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
cause more confusion rather than less is
 
00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
that part of what you're saying I think
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
I think that the way that it is written
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
right now it is interpreted as very
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
simply the employer cannot touch your
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
money without your written approval and
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
agreement with a spelled out document
 
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
that says how the money will be taken
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
from your
 
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
pay and leaving it at that leaves It
 
00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
Wide Open for every other possibility so
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
that you're not limiting things because
 
00:35:26.589 --> 00:35:26.599 align:start position:0%
then the bill will end up adding and
 
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
adding adding and adding so yes Vice
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
chair seaworth I I do believe that
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
leaving it more broad makes it simpler
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
but if obviously this committee deems
 
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise the Department of Labor will
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
administer as as you direct thank you
 
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.510 align:start position:0%
administer as as you direct thank you
representative

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
BL this bill to me seems to just uh
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
clarify what we've already got in
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
statute for for some people um you know
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
the a restaurant owner or any any
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
business owner could uh could just blow
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
right over this and not not even realize
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
they're doing something wrong for
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
starters and the employ and the same
 
00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
thing going for an employee wouldn't
 
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
this be a a good addition to our our
 
00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.030 align:start position:0%
this be a a good addition to our our
current

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
law I I'd have to go back to exactly
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
what I said it's already in there and I
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
think that I believe it was
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
representative KC's question about
 
00:36:23.069 --> 00:36:23.079 align:start position:0%
Macy's so are we going to add dasb that
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
if it's a retail store and somebody
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
walks out um having stolen items is that
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
going to be on the particular um the
 
00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
particular employee that was working
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
that section or the person that was
 
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.790 align:start position:0%
that section or the person that was
helping

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
helping
 
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
them it's already in the statute that
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
the employer cannot do this delineating
 
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
things it does make it overly
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
complicated could make it confusing
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
could make it so that there's more
 
00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:52.599 align:start position:0%
questions that are
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
presented but again if the committee do
 
00:36:59.309 --> 00:36:59.319 align:start position:0%
decides otherwise and to add these
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
individual exceptions
 
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
obviously follow uh would would an
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to just to reward this uh
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
something to the effect no employee
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
shall be held responsible for theft um
 
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.069 align:start position:0%
shall be held responsible for theft um
you

00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
know you know put yeah unless wrong but
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know for for any theft I uh I worked
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
on a beer truck back in the day and you
 
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
know we had liquor two and the five
 
00:37:27.069 --> 00:37:27.079 align:start position:0%
cases of Johnny Walker black when time
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
took a you know went missing and uh you
 
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
know while we were bringing stuff in and
 
00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
out of the store and uh the the boss did
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
want to but it was a union job and they
 
00:37:39.069 --> 00:37:39.079 align:start position:0%
weren't allowed to but um you know that
 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
they they would have if um you know if
 
00:37:45.309 --> 00:37:45.319 align:start position:0%
that if if they could have uh you know
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
without without protection uh without
 
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
Clarity I think this happens more often
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
I then I think something to that effect
 
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
would clarify the law for even the
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
simplest of Minds to to understand
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're saying and if
 
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
this committee were to decide that a
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
clarification needs to go in obviously
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
the department of labor would be able to
 
00:38:07.309 --> 00:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
administer that but I do have to
 
00:38:12.309 --> 00:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
reiterate that it is theft if they do it
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
any other way than is set into
 
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
7548 okay thank you any further
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative kahill uh just
 
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
to put a finer point on my colleagues
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
across the way if it was uh other than
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
other theft other than hand in the till
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know caught in the act definitely
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
employee responsible would that uh help
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
us a
 
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
bit if an employer has knowledge has a
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
witness has a credible belief that their
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
employee is in some way robbing them
 
00:38:52.589 --> 00:38:52.599 align:start position:0%
whether it's colluding with friends to
 
00:38:57.069 --> 00:38:57.079 align:start position:0%
walk out on a check or hand in the tail
 
00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
there are other ways for recourse and
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
that goes into the various court systems
 
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.430 align:start position:0%
that goes into the various court systems
criminal

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
law but this covers anything that an
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
employer could possibly want to deduct
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
outside of your normal deductions for
 
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
insurance and other things that
 
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
employees obviously have already written
 
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
and approved for those
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
deductions this covers it as far as the
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor is deals with these
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
particular types of cases the rest of it
 
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
would obviously have other recourse
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
thank you any further
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
um I do have one other card as uh
 
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
anticipating the questions that we have
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
from uh Mike Summers who's representing
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
Association good morning Mr Mr chairman
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you uh
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to speak to you
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
today uh again for the record my name is
 
00:40:03.309 --> 00:40:03.319 align:start position:0%
Mike Summers I'm the president CEO of
 
00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:05.079 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
 
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
Association uh I signed in an opposition
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
frankly because I think this bill is a
 
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem um as a
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
department testified they don't get
 
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
calls about this um I talk to an awful
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
lot of people in this industry and I
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
can't recall the last time I heard of a
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
case like this um that aside uh one of
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
the questions earlier was whether or not
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh our association uh does communication
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
and that kind of Outreach to our members
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
on this topic and the answer to that
 
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
question is yes we do uh we are not
 
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
usually focused on this portion of it
 
00:40:38.829 --> 00:40:38.839 align:start position:0%
but about this part of the statute
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
because this statute is very
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
prescriptive you cannot touch any
 
00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
employees wages they are the property of
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
the employee you cannot take them unless
 
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
they meet one of these very narrow uh
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
scenarios and I would like to point to
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
one section which I think the department
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
essentially referred to which uh for me
 
00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
is about as clear as you can make it
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
without making it you know by industry
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
in an individual in instance which I
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
think would to one of the comments
 
00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
earlier it would be just like
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
wallpapering a room but uh I will read
 
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.990 align:start position:0%
for you
27548

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
27548
 
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.710 align:start position:0%
27548
1

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
1
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
B2 if I'm reading this correctly for any
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
purpose on which the employer and
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
employee mutually agree that does not
 
00:41:23.309 --> 00:41:23.319 align:start position:0%
Grant financial advantage to the
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
employer I don't think you how you make
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
it any clearer than that frankly so
 
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
again I go back to I think we're kind of
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
looking at this is a solution in search
 
00:41:34.109 --> 00:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
of a problem and I would suggest uh to
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
the sponsor appreciate the effort
 
00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward but if he has
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
heard of instances of this happening we
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
would highly recommend that uh he
 
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
encourage people that he spoken to to
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
reach out to the department because we
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
don't stand for it we don't condone it
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
and we certainly make sure that our
 
00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:50.839 align:start position:0%
members and and the bulk of the industry
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
knows about this issue so this is not
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
new territory the one time the couple of
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
times that I've heard heard about this
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
in my 15 plus years in this organization
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
the only couple of times I'd heard about
 
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
when we had business owners who had
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
moved here from other states where this
 
00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
is allowed had opened a business and
 
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
things had happened etc etc and the
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
moment we heard about it we made sure to
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
reach out to them directly and tell them
 
00:42:14.829 --> 00:42:14.839 align:start position:0%
you cannot do that here um and there are
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
other parts of the statute that uh there
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
are similar things like that for example
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
U I won't open a can of worms I'll stick
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
to the bill so um so I think with that I
 
00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:26.559 align:start position:0%
am happy to uh conclude and try answer
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have all right
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative Granger thank
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
you so uh question was asked earlier
 
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
about uh when it would be taken out of
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
wages so a lot of employees they get a
 
00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:40.559 align:start position:0%
paid check so if you're a server you get
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
a paid check and then you also collect
 
00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
cash from uh paying customers and then
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
you would uh pay you would divvy that up
 
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
because if they're paying their whole
 
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
bill and you know you take your portion
 
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
of the tips and you pay take the portion
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
that's paying for the actual meal you
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
calculate that up and then you put the
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
cash in the till uh do you happen to
 
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
know if in other states where people do
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
do this sort of thing when the actual
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
deduction occurs
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
normally I can't speak to it because
 
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
frankly I've never been involved in it
 
00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
directly um but I one thing I will
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
allude to is I know that everyone thinks
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
that tips are cash these days and I'm
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
raise show your hand you know show a
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
hands how many people actually have paid
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
a bill on a tip recently with
 
00:43:25.079 --> 00:43:27.390 align:start position:0%
a bill on a tip recently with
cash

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
cash
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
well maybe that's an age thing so um so
 
00:43:33.309 --> 00:43:33.319 align:start position:0%
setting that aside uh I will say that
 
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
most B not most but a a significant
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
portion of businesses now they don't do
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
a quote unquote cash out at the end of a
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
night anymore because the majority of
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
the tips received by most restaurant
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
servers now are in the form of credit
 
00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
card payments so you most of them will
 
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
essentially just at the end at the end
 
00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
of the pay period they will just pay out
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
all of the tips so my suspicion is if
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
this is happening in other states it's
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
probably taken at that point rather than
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
taken directly out of cash at the end of
 
00:43:59.950 --> 00:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
a night although I'm certainly sure that
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
if you know it was in that situation
 
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
that could be handled that way thank you
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.109 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
representative

00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
Kum thank you Mr
 
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
chairman would you agree um in talking
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
about uh RSA
 
00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
27548 112 or is it 212
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
112 uh that it would be a disadvantage
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
to an employer to have somebody steal
 
00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:24.990 align:start position:0%
to an employer to have somebody steal
from

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.589 align:start position:0%
from
them

00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
it would be a disadvantage to the
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
employer but this is about the agreement
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
between the employer and the employee
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
and in this instance it would be to the
 
00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
benefit of the employer and not the
 
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
employee because the employer would
 
00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
essenti employee would essentially be
 
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
covering the losses for the business so
 
00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
I think that the department I don't want
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
to speak for them I think that's about
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
as bright a line as you can draw PA
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
please so if the theft is a disadvantage
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
would it then become an advantage for
 
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
them to be able to recoup the money from
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
somebody else other than their insurance
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
company which may for further cause a
 
00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
penalty to their insurance policy or
 
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
other charges so is it then an advantage
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
because they've recouped their loss from
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
somebody else well I think that's my
 
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
point that if they were have recouped
 
00:45:11.309 --> 00:45:11.319 align:start position:0%
this money from the employee that
 
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:13.640 align:start position:0%
agreement between employee and employer
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
would be to the advantage of the
 
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
employer and therefore not allowed okay
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
sorry I think I misunderstood what you
 
00:45:20.829 --> 00:45:20.839 align:start position:0%
said originally I
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
follow-ups representative mcken thank
 
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
you uh so the the person can agree if
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
they agree to cover the losses of the
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
employer currently the law allows them
 
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.079 align:start position:0%
to do that I don't think it
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
does I I think that is misc
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
characterization because let me read you
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
that statement again um which an
 
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
employer and employee mutually agree
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
that does not Grant financial advantage
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
to the employer and I think any instance
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
where the employer would retain
 
00:45:58.510 --> 00:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
wages or earnings of the employee would
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
be to the detriment of the employee and
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the employer so I think
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to speak to the
 
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
department but I think that is is a very
 
00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.670 align:start position:0%
department but I think that is is a very
bright

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
love I'm going to guess that uh you know
 
00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
most of your members are very reputable
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
businesses they they're interested in
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
the law they're interested in I hope so
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
yes and uh but the the sad F fact of the
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
matter is uh a lot of business aren't
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
very you know very reputable very uh you
 
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
know law-abiding a lot of lot of
 
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
businesses fly by the seat of the pants
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
and uh uh as I go out to eat uh you know
 
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
most of the the the weight staff is
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
usually you know 23 and under you know
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
young vulnerable gullible uh kids you
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
know that that don't know uh I like the
 
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
idea of clarifying is that a question um
 
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
would would you be okay with just
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
clarifying for the for the Young and not
 
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:01.640 align:start position:0%
educated so I have a two-part response
 
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
the first part is um I disagree with the
 
00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
characterization that there are a lot of
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
disreputable businesses in our industry
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
I think there are an awful lot of very
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
good hardworking small mom and pop
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
businesses in our industry who work very
 
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
hard to try to comply with all the rules
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
and regulations that are laid out before
 
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
them I will also say that that is an
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
awful lot of rules and regulations that
 
00:47:21.549 --> 00:47:21.559 align:start position:0%
they have to comply with with one of
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
most heavily regulated industries that
 
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
said to your point about clar ification
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
I think in concept that sounds fantastic
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
but I think the real issue is there is
 
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
not a 22 or a 23 year old that is ever
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
going to read
 
00:47:33.839 --> 00:47:36.069 align:start position:0%
going to read
27

00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
27
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
27548 and uh you know the department has
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
already testified that uh you know if
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
they get a call they certainly educate
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
folks we work very hard to make sure
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
that our business owners know what the
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations are and whenever
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
we have come in contact with business
 
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
and randomly we will get a call from an
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
employee with a question about something
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
we make a point if we don't know the
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
answer we will get them the answer so I
 
00:47:59.230 --> 00:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
think there are a lot of a lot of
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
mechanisms of of trying to communicate
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
what the rules and regulations are but
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
if if the expectation is that a 22 or 23
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
or a younger you know less educated
 
00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
person working in the restaurant
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
industry working their way through
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
school or whatever is going to read
 
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:23.079 align:start position:0%
effort representative kill thank you Mr
 
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
chair thank you SU Tak my question uh
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
would you believe that uh that I mean I
 
00:48:33.069 --> 00:48:33.079 align:start position:0%
think you'd acknowledge that not every
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
restaurant mom and pop or otherwise is a
 
00:48:37.549 --> 00:48:37.559 align:start position:0%
member of your Association which I think
 
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
is a shame because you do so work so
 
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
hard to educate them and Us by way of
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
bringing up this attention to that D12
 
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is that I haven't read uh
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
would you believe that there are that it
 
00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
does in fact happen and that it
 
00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't happen that people uh get
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
confronted by the boss well I lost money
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
today and I'm not going to take it
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to give me this money and
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
or else or you lose your job and you'll
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
have to go look for another one and it's
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
not always such a demanding economy up
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
from the employer side would you believe
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
that maybe we should do more to educate
 
00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh maybe that your the other
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
business owners don't read the statute
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
either that more education would be
 
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
beneficial I would I I'm always for more
 
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
education um and to your comment about
 
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:27.079 align:start position:0%
what I believe that the happens I'm sure
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
that there are in some rare instances it
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
happens um but I don't know that we want
 
00:49:33.549 --> 00:49:33.559 align:start position:0%
to necessarily uh get tangled up in that
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
because again I I think it's just
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
covered in the statute the department
 
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
already testified to that uh to your
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
comment about not all indust uh me you
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
know businesses in the industry are
 
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
members absolutely true we represent
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
about a third of the industry uh paying
 
00:49:49.789 --> 00:49:49.799 align:start position:0%
members and and actively participate but
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
I will also say that as we walk into
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
those businesses who are not members of
 
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
our organization more often than not we
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
find the materials that we send out to
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
our members are showing up in their
 
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
businesses because our industry is
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
famous for networking you know we have
 
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
five six seven members in an area and
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
there's 25 restaurants they all talk to
 
00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
each other they all know each other they
 
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
compete with each other they share
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
things amongst themselves whether it's
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
food staff Etc um so our reach well if
 
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
we can only quantify it by X we know it
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
is much higher than that um but to the
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
bottom bottom line of your question yes
 
00:50:26.349 --> 00:50:26.359 align:start position:0%
we would are normally more open to more
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
education is always good for everyone
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
involved follow up so so your materials
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
are not copywritten or or anything like
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
that and you might would you might
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
consider lowering your lowering your fee
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
for membership so that more people would
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
join Mr avalani for I don't know if he's
 
00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.270 align:start position:0%
join Mr avalani for I don't know if he's
a

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:46.799 align:start position:0%
member I actually don't recall if he is
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:53.799 align:start position:0%
you representative Granger uh thank you
 
00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
the simple question uh insurance
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
insurance has been brought up a couple
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
times so is loss from people running out
 
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
on their on their tab covered by
 
00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:01.829 align:start position:0%
on their on their tab covered by
insurance

00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
normally not normally and frankly most
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
businesses wouldn't apply to it because
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
it would just drive up your insurance
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
rates um and this is not that common of
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
An Occurrence that just as a general
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
rule that people walk out on their tabs
 
00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
I remember when I was a kid there was
 
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
the D and dash scenario right um that
 
00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
really doesn't happen that that
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
often thank you representative balone
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good to see you
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
again Mr Summers I am not a member um it
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
would be improper of me to be a member
 
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
and then question you um which is what I
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
suspected but I want to put you in a
 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
spot so thank you well I I clarified
 
00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
that um I will say in the light it the
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
reason that dond Dash has gone away
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
almost pretty much is the adoption of um
 
00:51:47.549 --> 00:51:47.559 align:start position:0%
security systems and cameras within
 
00:51:49.789 --> 00:51:49.799 align:start position:0%
correct restaurants and all all other
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
areas so I mean it's becoming less and
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
less of a problem I totally agree with
 
00:51:56.349 --> 00:51:56.359 align:start position:0%
that statement and
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
what I believe um totally agree with
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
that statement um and most restaurants
 
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
have cameras right at the front door for
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
those reasons uh ALS yes that is
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely true
 
00:52:09.069 --> 00:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
yes thank you any further
 
00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you very much for
 
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
your input thank that was the last pink
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
card I had on this bill uh
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative Kum if you could pass the
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
blue sheet forward for this bill and um
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
I see the sponsor of the next bill if
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
you could make sure your pink card gets
 
00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:29.559 align:start position:0%
up here that would be
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.710 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:49.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
is these are the next one that and this
 
00:52:56.789 --> 00:52:56.799 align:start position:0%
is the so so the this is the sign the
 
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
signin sheet for the bill we just heard
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh had no uh signups Beyond those who
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
testified oh no signups at all um so
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
with that I will close the hearing on HB
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
1051 and we'll move directly to the
 
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.710 align:start position:0%
 
bill

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
hi so I'm representative Eric
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um representative from uh
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
conquered Ward six um and I am here to
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
introduce HB
 
00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
1072 uh relative to prohibiting
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
employers from using polygraph
 
00:53:48.359 --> 00:53:50.190 align:start position:0%
employers from using polygraph
testing

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.030 align:start position:0%
testing
so

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
um so I bring this bill for
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
forward uh during a time when we're at
 
00:54:03.549 --> 00:54:03.559 align:start position:0%
record lows for unemployment and one of
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
the things when presented with our low
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
unemployment numbers that people will do
 
00:54:11.549 --> 00:54:11.559 align:start position:0%
is sometimes they'll say oh
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
well um the low unemployment numbers
 
00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:17.720 align:start position:0%
fail to take into account people who
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
have dropped out of the workforce
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
entirely so um I've endeavored to
 
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
uh take that Counterpoint seriously and
 
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
look at addressing some of the reasons
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
people might drop out of the
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
workforce um entirely uh one of
 
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
which I think is the entire job
 
00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:44.910 align:start position:0%
which I think is the entire job
application

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
process that we have and the
 
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
um the coercive power that
 
00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
employers maintain in such a
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
process um so often times job Seekers
 
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
will um when discussing advice with one
 
00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.990 align:start position:0%
will um when discussing advice with one
another

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
um what one piece of advice you'll often
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
hear is oh just lie on your job
 
00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.990 align:start position:0%
hear is oh just lie on your job
application

00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:19.480 align:start position:0%
and the thing is it really shouldn't be
 
00:55:22.349 --> 00:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
necessary to do that you should be able
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
to answer the questions in
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
um in a job interview truthfully without
 
00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing your employment um so the
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
bill I originally wanted to file was
 
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
something um broader based basically um
 
00:55:44.109 --> 00:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
regulating the sorts of questions that
 
00:55:47.309 --> 00:55:47.319 align:start position:0%
can be asked and the types of um answers
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
that can be provided but um OS never got
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
back to me uh with or never complet
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
completed that research request for me
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
in time but one thing I did find though
 
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
that was kind of related to the topic
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
was apparently um
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
federal um employee polygraph protection
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
act that exists that prevents the use of
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
um employers from using polygraph tests
 
00:56:22.829 --> 00:56:22.839 align:start position:0%
commonly as Li detector tests
 
00:56:27.029 --> 00:56:27.039 align:start position:0%
um and the job app application process
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
um and so it's it's federal law and it's
 
00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
got exemptions for state level stuff
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
which leaves room for states to
 
00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
craft um their own versions of it and so
 
00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:45.640 align:start position:0%
I asked OLS if they could draft a state
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
level version of it for me and they
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
found actually Vermont has a similar
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
um law on their books at the state level
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
that they um largely copied this from um
 
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
so yeah basically
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's basically copied from
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
Vermont's uh legislation prohibition on
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
polygraph examinations um although one
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
thing um so the amendment I passed
 
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
around um so one one bit of feedback I
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
got back from it was um the head of uh
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
dncr I think the division of natural I
 
00:57:35.069 --> 00:57:35.079 align:start position:0%
forget the whole acronym something about
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
natural resources um got in touch with
 
00:57:40.589 --> 00:57:40.599 align:start position:0%
me um wanting to add an additional
 
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
exemption for
 
00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:48.839 align:start position:0%
um for Rangers in fishing game and
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
um other sorts
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
of uh positions like that so given the
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
existing uh exemptions that are already
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
in the bill I figured that was fine and
 
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
requested that an amendment be drafted
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
to that effect
 
00:58:09.599 --> 00:58:13.029 align:start position:0%
to that effect
um

00:58:13.029 --> 00:58:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah to to be clear I I don't think
 
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
that job Seekers should lie in job
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
interviews I just I I do think that um
 
00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
that employers shouldn't
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
be putting them in a stressful situation
 
00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
where um
 
00:58:36.599 --> 00:58:38.950 align:start position:0%
where um
they're

00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839 align:start position:0%
um apt to screw up somehow just due to
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
from the um an anxiety about um how to
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
answer job interview questions
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
because that's basically what the
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
function of polygraph tests is it's not
 
00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
act like they're called lie detector
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
tests but they're not actually really
 
00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:09.160 align:start position:0%
good at detecting lies though um you
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
know there there have been studies
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
um Paul uh Paul emman a famous
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
psychologist did studies um showing that
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
they weren't re um weren't really any
 
00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
more accurate than like this ancient Tri
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
practice that um some uncon uncontacted
 
00:59:32.029 --> 00:59:32.039 align:start position:0%
group had where they'd ask someone to
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
just hold an egg um and then if it broke
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
that would um indicate lying and
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
polygraph tests really aren't that much
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
more accurate than that
 
00:59:43.079 --> 00:59:44.910 align:start position:0%
more accurate than that
um

00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah they basically they don't work
 
00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
they just serve to create anxiety for
 
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
job Seekers and therefore should um
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
be prohibited to prevent
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
um to to help um help keep job Seekers
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
from being intimidated during the uh job
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
application process so let's this bill
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
and um I'll take questions now thank you
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
Drago thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm curious I see all
 
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
the uh the exemptions on the amendment
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
do what other do you know of other
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
businesses that are actually
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
administering polygraph tests I I
 
01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
honestly don't haven't heard of many
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
that do
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
that um well so yeah it the this is
 
01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:44.670 align:start position:0%
that um well so yeah it the this is
really

01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:47.799 align:start position:0%
um more just
 
01:00:51.549 --> 01:00:51.559 align:start position:0%
or this is less about any
 
01:00:51.559 --> 01:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
or this is less about any
particular

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
um any particular case then it is about
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
the just general chilling effect of the
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
possibility that that might be one of
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
the things that might be required um
 
01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:10.119 align:start position:0%
that it might have on job applicants
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
um and yeah
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
just I I think that just knowing that
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't be something that they'd
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
have to face would make people more
 
01:01:28.589 --> 01:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
representative Granger uh thank you uh
 
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
question about the egg so I have a
 
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
plethora of eggs um but I am constantly
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
surrounded by Liars because I work in
 
01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
the state house um how exactly did that
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
work what do I got to look up in order
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
um well so yeah basically what I I I was
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
using that as an example of something
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't actually work so I don't I
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
don't actually recommend that you bring
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
in eggs um but yeah so for the
 
01:02:04.079 --> 01:02:05.710 align:start position:0%
in eggs um but yeah so for the
comparison

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
um the so for the comparison between
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
that and polygraphs um that was
 
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh famously popularized on the uh TV
 
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
show Li toy uh which was in fact based
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
on real research of the psychologist
 
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
Paul Ean
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
um but yeah basically what polygraphs do
 
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
is they just measure the um emotional
 
01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:34.039 align:start position:0%
excitedness or
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
agitated um of the person that it's
 
01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
being administered to and you can be
 
01:02:44.029 --> 01:02:44.039 align:start position:0%
emotionally excited or agitated for a
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
lot of other reasons besides lying um
 
01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
you know Ju Just because you're nervous
 
01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
or something or other things like that
 
01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
and you know that's kind of the same
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
Principle as the egg can also break for
 
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
other reasons besides someone lying you
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
know just because they're
 
01:03:06.029 --> 01:03:06.039 align:start position:0%
clumsy um so yeah in in in each case
 
01:03:10.589 --> 01:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
there are examples of um tests that
 
01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be taken
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
seriously thank
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
01:03:21.309 --> 01:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
questions representative c one thank you
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair do you I might have not
 
01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
heard properly the question that
 
01:03:29.789 --> 01:03:29.799 align:start position:0%
representative Drago asked but um is
 
01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
this something that you have experienced
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
with an employer when you were seeking
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
or is this something that one of your
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
constituents brought to you saying that
 
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
they feel that this is an issue that
 
01:03:40.109 --> 01:03:40.119 align:start position:0%
they've experienced what was the impetus
 
01:03:45.269 --> 01:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
to this um well it's just um yeah again
 
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
it's not so much in response to any
 
01:03:50.029 --> 01:03:50.039 align:start position:0%
particular case of an employer using
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
polygraph testing as it is to um just
 
01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
try and to enact some sort of
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
legislation on the general principle of
 
01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.589 align:start position:0%
legislation on the general principle of
um

01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
reducing the imbalance of power in the
 
01:04:10.589 --> 01:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
um job application process um and it it
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
is something that people worry about um
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
you know regard regardless of whether it
 
01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
actually happens or not so I I think by
 
01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.470 align:start position:0%
actually happens or not so I I think by
passing

01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
passing
 
01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
this law um you know we could help
 
01:04:29.549 --> 01:04:29.559 align:start position:0%
instill confidence in more job Seekers
 
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
to try to apply for the jobs that
 
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
employers are saying they're having such
 
01:04:39.069 --> 01:04:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
filling thank you and thank you for
 
01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:44.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question I as an employer
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
myself I have had employees come in or
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
prospective employees drastically
 
01:04:51.069 --> 01:04:51.079 align:start position:0%
overstate their experience and it was
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
only after they were hired that I found
 
01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
out that that they actually did in fact
 
01:04:57.269 --> 01:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
not know what they were talking about or
 
01:04:59.710 --> 01:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
what they were doing so I don't
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
administer a polygraph test I actually
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
don't know any employers that do but my
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
question would
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
be why would it be okay to create a law
 
01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
to say that I as a business owner cannot
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
do that to
 
01:05:15.069 --> 01:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
verify that the person I'm hiring
 
01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
actually does know the specific skill
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
set that I want and not just that they
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
can walk in and be honest and lie on
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
their application
 
01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
why do I not have that opportunity if
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass well um
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
so one because it doesn't actually work
 
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
and two um
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
because I I think that a lot of the
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
problem here is that the motivations are
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
in place to um for people to like um you
 
01:05:51.359 --> 01:05:53.069 align:start position:0%
in place to um for people to like um you
know

01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:05:53.079 --> 01:05:55.589 align:start position:0%
know
if

01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
um you know if employers and the J job
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
application process had generally
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
created um more of a culture of being
 
01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
willing to hire people even when um
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
they're honest about their shortcomings
 
01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
and um less likely to um puff themselves
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
up um then people wouldn't feel as much
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
of a need to do it any do that sort of
 
01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:28.750 align:start position:0%
of a need to do it any do that sort of
behavior

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
anymore um so yeah I I I think this is
 
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
just one part of um a larger effort
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
that's needed to change the incentives
 
01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:42.670 align:start position:0%
that's needed to change the incentives
involved

01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
here representative
 
01:06:46.829 --> 01:06:46.839 align:start position:0%
alalani thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
you representative gag for the questions
 
01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
today um I see a lot of exemptions in
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
your Amendment and in the bill are there
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
any other industries that you think
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
should not be using polygraphs outside
 
01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:02.839 align:start position:0%
of the things that the places you
 
01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:05.799 align:start position:0%
referenced here
 
01:07:09.069 --> 01:07:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
mean well I so so I I
 
01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.309 align:start position:0%
mean well I so so I I
personally

01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
personally
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
um would prefer the list of exemptions
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
to be kept minimal um the ones that
 
01:07:25.269 --> 01:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
exist are just for simil it with other
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
states existing law to make it easier to
 
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
administer um since we can then just
 
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
base our experience off the experiences
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
that other states have had with similar
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
laws um so yeah in in terms of other
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
exemptions I would look to what other
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
done any further questions
 
01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.630 align:start position:0%
done any further questions
representative

01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:53.079 align:start position:0%
low thank you for taking my question uh
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:59.470 --> 01:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
um you you have your carve outs here
 
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
that uh you know the exemptions and uh
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
you know I I think we could probably go
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
around this room and everybody everybody
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
could add one one business or another
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
that they've known that there lost lost
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of money you know to to theft and
 
01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know this would this would be
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
preventing somebody and uh from from
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
from possibly identifying a a Thief um I
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
know in my business from time to time
 
01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:27.640 align:start position:0%
you know my insurance did cover it but I
 
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
lost a lot of material and and you know
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
some tools and and things like that uh
 
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
my uh my my late father-in-law 30 years
 
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
ago owned two recovery hospitals is is
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
this a
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
question um would you
 
01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:43.480 align:start position:0%
believe uh there were pleas for everyone
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
in the committee this isn't an
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to convince the
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
people who come to
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
testify where they might disagree with
 
01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.590 align:start position:0%
testify where they might disagree with
us

01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
please restrict this to a question that
 
01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
you if you want information from the
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor try to keep your comments in in
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
that direction thank you okay um would
 
01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
you be opposed to having more exemptions
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:09:12.239 --> 01:09:15.709 align:start position:0%
rather than
less

01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
um well all right so I did not oppose
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
the um DNC
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
cr's um request to add an exemp um
 
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:30.759 align:start position:0%
additional exemption for them because I
 
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
saw that as in line with the existing
 
01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
ones that were already in the bill so I
 
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
guess it would really depend on um
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
whether they're in line with the
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
existing ones in the bill or
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
not thank you any further
 
01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
01:09:53.789 --> 01:09:53.799 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you next up and I I
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to mispronounce your name so
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
I'll let you say it but from the New
 
01:09:59.870 --> 01:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of chiefs of
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
police uh 3 minutes of testimony you
 
01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
didn't sign in either for or against
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
morning I'm sorry so good morning uh my
 
01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
name is Charles rage I'm the chief of
 
01:10:25.149 --> 01:10:25.159 align:start position:0%
the Hinsdale police dep department and
 
01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
um the reason that we didn't sign for or
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
opposed is because um we believe that
 
01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is proposed has uh and some
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
areas of concern for us for some of our
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
employees who aren't necessarily sworn
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
police Personnel um overall I have a lot
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
of experience working with polygraphs
 
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not a polygrapher um but there are
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
specific tool for a specific purpose um
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
they're very good at uh determining
 
01:10:53.709 --> 01:10:53.719 align:start position:0%
whether or not someone's accurate on
 
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
their application on the background
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
other things it's uh no different than
 
01:10:58.830 --> 01:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
if you have a Carpenter and he's got a
 
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
saw and he makes precise cuts when he's
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
building a house or mechanic that needs
 
01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
a wrench to get into a certain piece of
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
a car it's uh it's the same thing and uh
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
we believe that it's important to give
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
our employees all the tools they need to
 
01:11:16.669 --> 01:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
do a good job to hire the best employees
 
01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
possible uh the polygraph is important
 
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
because it's a double check of a
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
background process um and I'm sure that
 
01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
that translates into uh many fields that
 
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
are outside of law enforcement probably
 
01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
medical uh Insurance banking um anything
 
01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
in the finance world I have witnessed uh
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
many polygraphs in my career I've been
 
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
the subject of two of them I've
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
witnessed employees I've witnessed them
 
01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
with um sometimes as suspects and crimes
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
so I I can say with uh with a degree of
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
certainty that it that depends on the
 
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
operator if you have a polygrapher who's
 
01:11:55.149 --> 01:11:55.159 align:start position:0%
very good with us using his tool um
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's the same as bringing your car to
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
a reliable mechanic you want to make
 
01:12:00.189 --> 01:12:00.199 align:start position:0%
sure that it's it's operating properly
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
and I can say through 20 years of
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
experience that I know that it works and
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
it works very well um in law enforcement
 
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
we do have very uh a very large group of
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
people who aren't necessarily sworn
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
officers you have uh Corrections guards
 
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
um evidence technicians I mean imagine
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
you have somebody in an Evidence room
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
they're handling narcotics money firearm
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh dispatchers they know everything
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
about people they have their social
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
security numbers their driver's license
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
their mother's made a name um so they're
 
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
handling uh very sensitive information
 
01:12:35.629 --> 01:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
and other things too like social workers
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
you know they we're hiring social
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
workers now we spent a lot of time and
 
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
energy the last four years learning how
 
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
to deescalate situations how to uh help
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
get out involved in the community and
 
01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
undercut problems before they start and
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
all these people they're uh they're
 
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
holding important positions that are
 
01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
responsible to the community and they're
 
01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
responsible to the department and to the
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
public in general and uh I think that I
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of the association when
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
I say that we want to make sure that we
 
01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
provide the public with the best public
 
01:13:08.189 --> 01:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
servant we can give you and the
 
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
polygraph is a good way of doing that
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
and the the bill was written doesn't
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
cover our non-sworn
 
01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
Personnel thank you for your testimony
 
01:13:19.709 --> 01:13:19.719 align:start position:0%

federal law are you familiar with the
 
01:13:27.149 --> 01:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
scope of the federal law as it applies
 
01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
to this I'm not I'm a specialist in law
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%

01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%

for polygraph if this bill as written
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
and with the amendment would that you
 
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
would be able to do that anymore would
 
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:50.790 align:start position:0%

correctional officers are not sworn law
 
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement and therefore do not would
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
not fall under the exemptions that are
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
listed in this bill polygraphs are an
 
01:14:50.629 --> 01:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
important part of hiring correctional
 
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
officers at the County uh Correctional
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
facilities and we would want to ensure

that this bill was amended to include
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
them or that the bill not moveed forward
 
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh I'm happy to take any questions uh
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%

representative kokum if you could pass
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%

bill good morning Mr chairman members of
 
01:32:49.109 --> 01:32:49.119 align:start position:0%
the Labor's commit committee my name is
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
representative Tim MCU I represent marac
 
01:32:53.229 --> 01:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
hillsbrook County 12 and I'm here to
 
01:32:54.990 --> 01:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
talk to you today about fairness in the
 
01:32:58.510 --> 01:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
labor market leveling the playing field
 
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
asking our employers with employees more
 
01:33:05.229 --> 01:33:05.239 align:start position:0%
than 25 to use the federal free E verify
 
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
system to make sure everyone has access
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
to the same types of
 
01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
employment this this bill simply does
 
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
that if you have more than 25 employees
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
that ask you in addition to filling out
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
the I9 form to validate the perspect
 
01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:22.510 align:start position:0%
the I9 form to validate the perspect
itive

01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
itive
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
employees work eligibility using the E
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
verify system so I imagine there's a lot
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
of folks here that are familiar with e
 
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
verify I've heard about it over the
 
01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
years excuse me there's now I think my
 
01:33:37.229 --> 01:33:37.239 align:start position:0%
written testimony said 22 but a few more
 
01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
states have enacted it first of the year
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
so we're up to about 25 states that use
 
01:33:44.189 --> 01:33:44.199 align:start position:0%
e verify in some form or
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
another uh and the reason they do so is
 
01:33:49.070 --> 01:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
because e verify has a couple
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
differences uh between verify in the I9
 
01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
form so they still have to fill out the
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
I9 form uh you know look at the social
 
01:34:01.870 --> 01:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
security card but with the I9 you don't
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
actually have to have a picture ID to
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
get employment you need a social
 
01:34:09.390 --> 01:34:09.400 align:start position:0%
security number right to be lawfully
 
01:34:11.470 --> 01:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
employed in the United States takes
 
01:34:14.070 --> 01:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
about seven days or so to get it uh you
 
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
can go through the ever verify process
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
without a social security number while
 
01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
you're while you're waiting for it and
 
01:34:22.669 --> 01:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
there's like I I think it's 3 weeks
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
specifically uh to get it usually takes
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
about 7 days to get it in the mail uh so
 
01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
this doesn't preclude someone from
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
applying for a job even being offered uh
 
01:34:35.070 --> 01:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
the job um without a social security
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
card but what it does do is it allows
 
01:34:41.070 --> 01:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
people who are competing for jobs with
 
01:34:44.669 --> 01:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
potential ineligible employer employees
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
to compete on the same level so you have
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
someone who has all their paperwork in
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
order and they're competing for a job
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
against other folks who may not and the
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
employer potentially and often does uh
 
01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
pay a lower wage for those jobs and
 
01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
that's just not fair for people who've
 
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
done it the right way who have a Social
 
01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
Security and who are eligible to be
 
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
employed so that's basically what this
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
bill does in in a nutshell it's a way to
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
make it easier for employers to obtain
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
accurate employment eligibility
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
information using ever verify years ago
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
you may have heard uh well verify is not
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
always accurate it's those problems that
 
01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
were widely publicized about five six
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
years ago have long since been fixed
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
it's easy to get into easy to use and
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's free um for the
 
01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
employer so I think this initiative is a
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
significant step forward to ensuring
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
fair and legal and efficient employment
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
in our states doesn't change the
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping requirements that already
 
01:35:49.629 --> 01:35:49.639 align:start position:0%
exist I'm sure you all are familiar you
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
have to do the I9 form you have to keep
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
copies of the the paperwork and the
 
01:35:56.669 --> 01:35:56.679 align:start position:0%
document um but it will help employers
 
01:35:58.750 --> 01:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
potentially avoid those big fines from
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
250 to $2,500 those aren't the exact
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
numbers it's like two 273 and there some
 
01:36:08.669 --> 01:36:08.679 align:start position:0%
very odd numbers but about 250 to two to
 
01:36:12.030 --> 01:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
$2,500 uh for inaccurate I9 this takes
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
that right out of the picture um so on
 
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
an I9 form of course is mandatory
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
currently e verify is voluntary uh I9
 
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
you can actually do without a social
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
security number and with eify you have
 
01:36:28.990 --> 01:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
to have a Social Security number
 
01:36:31.149 --> 01:36:31.159 align:start position:0%
eventually to complete to close that
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
case uh So within about 3 weeks of
 
01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
opening it you have to have that and you
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
need to have a uh photo identity uh
 
01:36:41.070 --> 01:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
document from the typical uh list B is
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
everyone familiar with the the different
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
columns ABC I think everyone on labor
 
01:36:48.189 --> 01:36:48.199 align:start position:0%
knows about that
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
um so this is simply a streamlined way
 
01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
uh streamlined way to verify employment
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility for small employers who
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
don't have um well slightly you know
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
bigger than 25 employers that don't have
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
HR departments or the ability to do that
 
01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
sort of thing the government provides
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
this free service for that uh and and it
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
creates a very Level Playing Field
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
um I'll take any questions if you have
 
01:37:17.470 --> 01:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
any on on the background of e verifier
 
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
how we got here all right thank you for
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
your testimony I do have a a question
 
01:37:26.109 --> 01:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
clarification um from what you said you
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
talked about that it doesn't change the
 
01:37:32.109 --> 01:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping requirements and we we
 
01:37:34.270 --> 01:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
heard that we've heard this bill a
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
number of times so I've heard that
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
before that ever verify doesn't apply
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
additional laws it's a electronic way of
 
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:44.830 align:start position:0%
additional laws it's a electronic way of
of

01:37:44.830 --> 01:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
tracking eligibility for employment but
 
01:37:51.310 --> 01:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
your testimony today said that in fact
 
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
fact an employer that either is required
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
or elects to use e
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
verify might reject some applicants who
 
01:38:04.589 --> 01:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
would be eligible without ever verify
 
01:38:06.910 --> 01:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
but under ever verify they're not is
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
that what I heard you saying so if I
 
01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
understand you're correctly Mr chairman
 
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
and thanks for bringing that up
 
01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
um e verify makes what they already do
 
01:38:22.910 --> 01:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
more reliable and more accurate it do
 
01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
does I'm not I think I understood your
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
question um and it does sound like you
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
did and it was it was probably my
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation of what you were
 
01:38:33.790 --> 01:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
there might be additional requirements
 
01:38:40.270 --> 01:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
for ever verify users and I was that I
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
mean sure you could look at it and say
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
this is an additional requirement
 
01:38:45.629 --> 01:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
because if you have more than 25
 
01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
employees you have to log in and and do
 
01:38:49.870 --> 01:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
a quick check so there's some keystrokes
 
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
on a computer um that that's correct
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
then the benefit is all your prospective
 
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
employees are viewed equally with equal
 
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
status and you know that the documents
 
01:39:08.149 --> 01:39:08.159 align:start position:0%
being submitted to satisfy the federal
 
01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:09.320 align:start position:0%
federally required employment
 
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility check are valid right it's
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
got It's it's that check for you so it
 
01:39:16.270 --> 01:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
really protects both parties the
 
01:39:19.229 --> 01:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
employer and the employee right the
 
01:39:21.589 --> 01:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
employee doesn't have to settle for a
 
01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
lower wage because there are other
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
applicants who are willing to take a Cut
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
Rate pay because they may not have they
 
01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
check does that make
 
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
sense thank
 
01:39:44.589 --> 01:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:47.229 --> 01:39:47.239 align:start position:0%
questions representative kahill thank
 
01:39:48.589 --> 01:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
representative so if I understand this
 
01:39:53.589 --> 01:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
correctly any employer may now
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
voluntarily use this
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
system 100% correct yeah th this bill
 
01:40:01.589 --> 01:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
simply requires it for
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
25 employees or more follow up uh why
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
why the 25 number of threshold if um why
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you require for
 
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
all that's that's a good question um so
 
01:40:20.189 --> 01:40:20.199 align:start position:0%
i' I'd love for it to be more other
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
states have 50 other Stakes have made it
 
01:40:27.070 --> 01:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
mandatory for all public employees
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
um it it seems that the threshold or the
 
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
tolerance level is at about 25 or 50
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
with legislation that's passed around
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
the country and in talking to some of
 
01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
the really small employers uh Farm Stand
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
that has uh you know some seasonal
 
01:40:46.109 --> 01:40:46.119 align:start position:0%
increase to help pick pumpkins grapes
 
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
apples you know the crops that we have
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire corn whatever um
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
that they would rather be able to
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
they're always under 25 and they thought
 
01:40:58.109 --> 01:40:58.119 align:start position:0%
that for the volume of employees that
 
01:41:00.109 --> 01:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
they have come through for a couple days
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
at a time that it would just be too much
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
hassle for them so it it seemed like 25
 
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
was a good starting point certainly open
 
01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:09.239 align:start position:0%
to discuss the number make it 50 make it
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
zero depending on the will of the
 
01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
committee the committee's bill so the
 
01:41:15.229 --> 01:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
people with the farm stands don't have a
 
01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
smartphone that they could quickly
 
01:41:20.430 --> 01:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
use uh you know I didn't pull all the
 
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
people with the Farm Stand so I'll I'll
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
talk about the the couple that I'm
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
pretty familiar with and shop at myself
 
01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
in the local nashwa maram Hollis kind of
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
area um they do and they're very careful
 
01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
actually uh about checking their the
 
01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
documentation their of their workers
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
they've been asked and queried in the
 
01:41:42.510 --> 01:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
past by you know passers by that they
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
they weren't sure who's who's asking why
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
are you asking who my employees are uh
 
01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
you know they've had run-ins with uh
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
legal folks before so they're very
 
01:41:54.270 --> 01:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
careful to dot their eyes and cross
 
01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
their tees and they don't object um but
 
01:42:00.189 --> 01:42:00.199 align:start position:0%
but the issue I think is is making sure
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
that it's it's passable and that the
 
01:42:04.510 --> 01:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
majority of the small business with
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
seasonal or migrant workers uh are are
 
01:42:08.830 --> 01:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
satisfied so 25 seemed to be about the
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
right spot to start thank you further
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
much oh you do have a question oh you do
 
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
I'm all right thank you again thank you

Wellington I'm um a resident of Derry

01:43:38.599 --> 01:43:40.229 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to uh speak to you
today

01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
um as as uh representative MCU mentioned
 
01:43:45.870 --> 01:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
um and and folks on the committee
 
01:43:49.310 --> 01:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh e verify is already
 
01:43:51.629 --> 01:43:51.639 align:start position:0%
available to employeers who want to use
 
01:43:55.470 --> 01:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
it um it's not mandatory in this state
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
um the vast majority of the states have
 
01:44:00.990 --> 01:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
not seen fit to mandate their employers
 
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
to engage in eify even in some of the
 
01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
states that um do have e verify mandates
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
it's only for public employees and not
 
01:44:12.189 --> 01:44:12.199 align:start position:0%
for private employers which I think is
 
01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
also an important Point um ever verify
 
01:44:18.589 --> 01:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
was launched almost 30 years ago and yet
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
it still has this very poor
 
01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
participation rate of about 12% of
 
01:44:25.390 --> 01:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
employers within the United States use
 
01:44:28.990 --> 01:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
it even in states where e verify is
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
mandated to private employers many are
 
01:44:34.669 --> 01:44:34.679 align:start position:0%
scoff laws and don't participate for a
 
01:44:37.870 --> 01:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons um our primary
 
01:44:40.350 --> 01:44:40.360 align:start position:0%
concern is uh the immigrants rights
 
01:44:42.990 --> 01:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
network is the effect it would have on
 
01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
folks who are perceived to be
 
01:44:47.229 --> 01:44:47.239 align:start position:0%
non-citizens or actually are
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
non-citizens um representative MCU
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um um this would help uh
 
01:44:54.990 --> 01:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
eligible uh folks from being hired
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
rather than ineligible people that
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
suggests that there's a pre-screening
 
01:45:01.709 --> 01:45:01.719 align:start position:0%
that would go on and there isn't an
 
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
employer can't um ask for the I9
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
documents that we uh all employers must
 
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
request or do an E verify till an
 
01:45:12.189 --> 01:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
employment decision has been made in
 
01:45:15.229 --> 01:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
fact um one of the outcomes of the ever
 
01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
verify program has been an increase in
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
employment discrimination based on
 
01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
um nationality and the US Department of
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
Justice has put out guidance for folks
 
01:45:29.310 --> 01:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
that use ever verify because of the
 
01:45:34.350 --> 01:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
concerns pre-screening selective um uh
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
interviewing of folks that you think
 
01:45:38.669 --> 01:45:38.679 align:start position:0%
won't ever that are US citizens so you
 
01:45:41.310 --> 01:45:41.320 align:start position:0%
don't have to go through it um failure
 
01:45:45.149 --> 01:45:45.159 align:start position:0%
to tell um an employee that they uh came
 
01:45:47.950 --> 01:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
back as ineligible and and giving them
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
the chance to challenge that ineligible
 
01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
eligibility even today um with the the
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
better um uh they've improved the error
 
01:46:01.470 --> 01:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
rate of of um Mis uh misapplication of
 
01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:02.270 align:start position:0%
rate of of um Mis uh misapplication of
of

01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
eligibility in 2022 which is the latest
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
year that I could find for numbers
 
01:46:10.270 --> 01:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
almost 60,000 actually eligible folks
 
01:46:12.510 --> 01:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
were turned down because of an Ever
 
01:46:16.830 --> 01:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
verify um eror so that's of a primary
 
01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
concern to us and um last lastly uh this
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be consistent with um
 
01:46:27.870 --> 01:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's uh approach toward its
 
01:46:30.589 --> 01:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
business and to let employers decide
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
what's best for them small businesses
 
01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
would probably be at greatest risk
 
01:46:38.589 --> 01:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
because you do need um HR help to get
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
these um processes done correctly so um
 
01:46:44.589 --> 01:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
thank you I I'll yield to my
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
colleague thank you as jel Bonet legal
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
director of the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
and just a few additional points uh
 
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
beond what attorney Wellington said um I
 
01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
I did want to just flag for the
 
01:46:55.950 --> 01:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
committee that there is actually a
 
01:46:57.950 --> 01:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
pretty rich history of this committee
 
01:47:00.510 --> 01:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
considering uh similar versions of this
 
01:47:02.669 --> 01:47:02.679 align:start position:0%
bill uh and rejecting it on a bar
 
01:47:05.070 --> 01:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
bipartisan basis for many of the reasons
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
that attorney Wellington just presented
 
01:47:08.189 --> 01:47:08.199 align:start position:0%
so I did want just want to flag that for
 
01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
the committee uh it it it I can read
 
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
those two those three bills it's uh 2012
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
HB 1620 2015 HB 267 and 2022 hb1 24 just
 
01:47:23.550 --> 01:47:23.560 align:start position:0%
just two years ago and Not only was it
 
01:47:25.390 --> 01:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
because of the inaccuracy concerns that
 
01:47:26.910 --> 01:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
would have been raised but also because
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
of the business concerns that have been
 
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
raised the fact that what this bill does
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
um whether you agree or not with the
 
01:47:35.790 --> 01:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
underlying rationale is it imposes a
 
01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
burden a regulation on business at the
 
01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
end of the day some businesses may think
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
that that's fine um including some in
 
01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
this room other businesses may not for
 
01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
for various reasons but this does add a
 
01:47:50.669 --> 01:47:50.679 align:start position:0%
burden and in addition to the eror rate
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
though it has been improved it still
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
does exist and I think a single person
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
that improperly loses out on a job
 
01:47:59.550 --> 01:47:59.560 align:start position:0%
because of this is one too many and so
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
for those reasons uh we as well would
 
01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:03.719 align:start position:0%
ask that the committee reject this Bill
 
01:48:03.719 --> 01:48:06.350 align:start position:0%
ask that the committee reject this Bill
thank

01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:09.189 --> 01:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
you are there questions representative
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
bruy thank you Mr chairman Joe I didn't
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
get your last name oh I'm sorry it's a
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
Binet a be and boy I SS o NN e tte it's
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
like a Mississippi so lot of lot of
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
double continence I'm the legal director
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
at the ACLU of New Hampshire thank you
 
01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
my my boss Devon cha filled out the card
 
01:48:29.149 --> 01:48:29.159 align:start position:0%
only because I was in a different
 
01:48:29.159 --> 01:48:32.470 align:start position:0%
only because I was in a different
hearing

01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:35.589 --> 01:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
so other
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative balani thank
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh and thank you Mr
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
biset um the question I have is once you
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
start ever
 
01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
verify um is it mandatory to continue
 
01:48:48.149 --> 01:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
that process so business can't opt out
 
01:48:49.109 --> 01:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
once they're
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
in um
 
01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
they can opt out when it's completely
 
01:48:55.550 --> 01:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
voluntary it's an employer decision so
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
if it became too burdensome or they lost
 
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
their HR person they could they could
 
01:49:03.589 --> 01:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
stop thank you thank you Mr
 
01:49:06.910 --> 01:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
chairman other
 
01:49:09.390 --> 01:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
suvin could you give some um more detail
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
about the U the error rate what sorts of
 
01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
Errors uh take place uh
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
currently well you want me to go on oh
 
01:49:24.149 --> 01:49:24.159 align:start position:0%
that's so this this is a system that
 
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
relies on what the employer puts in and
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
what the records uh um in they ever
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
verify queries both the Social Security
 
01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
Administration and USCIS um the
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
immigration Service uh for for uh
 
01:49:44.669 --> 01:49:44.679 align:start position:0%
eligibility to work um so input by the
 
01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
employer can be problematic and if
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's um records that are uh have uh
 
01:49:53.550 --> 01:49:53.560 align:start position:0%
erroneous information on them th those
 
01:49:55.310 --> 01:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
can be problematic so that that those
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
could be two sources of a mismatch
 
01:50:00.910 --> 01:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
coming back uh that where an eligible
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
employee is deemed ineligible maybe a uh
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
a similar name Etc so um right now
 
01:50:10.109 --> 01:50:10.119 align:start position:0%
there's a pretty low error rate I
 
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
believe it was about
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
1% um but of those 12% of us employers
 
01:50:20.109 --> 01:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
that use it that still translated in 20
 
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
22 to almost
 
01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
60,000 actual eligible employees that
 
01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
were initially and maybe permanently um
 
01:50:31.790 --> 01:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
um deemed a mismatch because one of the
 
01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
other problems that Strays into
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
disperate treatment and discriminatory
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
treatment is many of the employeers fail
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
to tell that prospective employee that
 
01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
they they were a mismatch they just say
 
01:50:47.870 --> 01:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
we can't hire you um and so that person
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
never realizes that and therefore never
 
01:50:53.310 --> 01:50:53.320 align:start position:0%
has an opportunity to to grieve that and
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
to the the uh e verify system and and to
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
to fix that problem yeah and I would
 
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
just add on to that I think it's true
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
that the error rate is low relative to
 
01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
the number of queries that have been
 
01:51:07.470 --> 01:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
raised it is high relative to the number
 
01:51:10.270 --> 01:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
of lives impacted
 
01:51:13.149 --> 01:51:13.159 align:start position:0%
58,000 uh individuals as reflected in
 
01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
footnote 8 of Our Testimony real people
 
01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
just trying to work who can't work
 
01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
because of this or may or may have their
 
01:51:21.229 --> 01:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
ability to work hinder it I should say
 
01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
as a result of
 
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
this representative kahill thank you Mr
 
01:51:28.350 --> 01:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:51:31.030 --> 01:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
question uh is it also possible that
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
there may be sort of special characters
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
in a person's name that aren't entered
 
01:51:36.910 --> 01:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
into the system either by the person
 
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
with the Farm Stand and the and the and
 
01:51:41.550 --> 01:51:41.560 align:start position:0%
the smartphone like is there an out can
 
01:51:44.830 --> 01:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
anybody find the umla on their
 
01:51:48.350 --> 01:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
smartphone yes that there's those are
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
exactly some of the problems or customs
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
in other countries whether your your
 
01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
family name comes first or last as it
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
does here or whether you have three or
 
01:52:00.990 --> 01:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
four family names and maybe in um your
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
home country your mother's name would
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
become lost uh but you know in in the US
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
we generally use or we used to I guess I
 
01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
should say um one's father's name would
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
would come last so there's this's
 
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
confusion um in th in those ways and
 
01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
llots and things like that certainly
 
01:52:20.430 --> 01:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
have caused problems just
 
01:52:22.350 --> 01:52:22.360 align:start position:0%
honest errors but errors
 
01:52:24.510 --> 01:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
nonetheless thank you would you believe
 
01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
that my wife from Nigeria has seven
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
names I would I did practice immigration
 
01:52:33.229 --> 01:52:33.239 align:start position:0%
law for a while so I uh I'm familiar
 
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
with folks that have very different
 
01:52:37.790 --> 01:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
styles of identifying um who they are
 
01:52:40.830 --> 01:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
and their family lines Etc thank
 
01:52:43.629 --> 01:52:43.639 align:start position:0%

questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%

so all right thank you very much I have
 
01:52:59.950 --> 01:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
one final card on this bill Steve Dupri
 
01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
um speaking for himself for three
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
bill morning Mr chairman members of the
 
01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Steve dupry I live
 
01:53:15.790 --> 01:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
in conquered I'm originally from Conway
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
I had the honor of serving in this body
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
50 years ago and back then I figured out
 
01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
my hourly rate was about 27 cents an
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
hour you guys meet a lot more I like to
 
01:53:27.069 --> 01:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
kiddingly say you're worth every penny
 
01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:29.679 align:start position:0%
but seriously thank you for your service
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh I have no stake in this I uh have no
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
Ox toore I just thought it would be
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
useful to hear from an employer by way
 
01:53:40.870 --> 01:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
of background uh we are the largest
 
01:53:43.109 --> 01:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
employer of new Americans those are
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
citizens or excuse me refugees who are
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
given uh admission to this country
 
01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
because they um a humanitarian crisis
 
01:53:54.189 --> 01:53:54.199 align:start position:0%
South Sudan is a great example so
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
they're here legally they come as uh
 
01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
non-citizens they're given an
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work uh we started the
 
01:54:03.430 --> 01:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
largest new American job training
 
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
program in this state and funded it very
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
extensively they are frankly some of our
 
01:54:10.589 --> 01:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
very best employees who've been with us
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
a long time many of them are illiterate
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
um many don't know their birthday you'd
 
01:54:18.589 --> 01:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
be surprised out of my 300 Associates
 
01:54:21.069 --> 01:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
how many have a January 1 birthday
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
because that's what's assigned to them I
 
01:54:25.950 --> 01:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
use ever verify and I and I thought I
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
would just give you our
 
01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
perspective the error rate when it
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
started was high the error rate now is
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
less than 2% the largest source of
 
01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
errors in our experience which is
 
01:54:40.030 --> 01:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
consistent with what the research shows
 
01:54:42.270 --> 01:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
is that there's incorrect information
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
entered by the HR department off the
 
01:54:48.510 --> 01:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
I9 uh or there's been a change in a name
 
01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:50.360 align:start position:0%
spelling because people have many
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
different name spellings uh from where
 
01:54:55.629 --> 01:54:55.639 align:start position:0%
they've come from and remember a good
 
01:54:58.510 --> 01:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
portion of our Associates are when they
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
first start with us are illiterate or
 
01:55:01.990 --> 01:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
there's been a change in their
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
immigration status what the reason we
 
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
use it is there are a large number of
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
people who are able to obtain social
 
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
security cards that are false and I9
 
01:55:18.109 --> 01:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
that look okay what the eify does and
 
01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
you are talking to somebody who is not
 
01:55:22.270 --> 01:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
good with computers but my HR department
 
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
made me try it is that it's less than a
 
01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
two-minute process it is not hard
 
01:55:30.030 --> 01:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
technologically but when that
 
01:55:33.069 --> 01:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
certificate gets printed out or they you
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
print the the approval and you put that
 
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
in that file if it turns out
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
subsequently that you were misled by a
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
prospective employee you the employer
 
01:55:47.149 --> 01:55:47.159 align:start position:0%
are protected from liability and that's
 
01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
why we do it um I'm not not here to
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
debate whether folks who aren't
 
01:55:53.229 --> 01:55:53.239 align:start position:0%
documented should work or not the
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
federal law says it's against the law
 
01:55:57.069 --> 01:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
for us to hire people who are not
 
01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
eligible what it does for an employer is
 
01:56:02.589 --> 01:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
it gives you that Shield it's not hard
 
01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:03.800 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
technologically uh the error rate used
 
01:56:09.229 --> 01:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
to be bad and we were an early adopter
 
01:56:11.830 --> 01:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh it's much less now and it's usually
 
01:56:13.589 --> 01:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
one of those two things a name
 
01:56:15.709 --> 01:56:15.719 align:start position:0%
misspelling which as you can imagine
 
01:56:17.950 --> 01:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
with somebody who's an illiterate news
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
citizen it's very important you actually
 
01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
check the name against their documents
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
that allowed them to come into this
 
01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
country uh there's a now pre-check
 
01:56:28.390 --> 01:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
system to make sure you don't push that
 
01:56:31.310 --> 01:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
button and it gives us that
 
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:34.679 align:start position:0%
security does it deny those people who
 
01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
there is a false what I'll call a false
 
01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
positive it does but here's what else is
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
going on and it happens in New Hampshire
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
and it happens nationally there are a
 
01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
lot of people who get employed who can't
 
01:56:49.069 --> 01:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
get ever verified because they do not
 
01:56:51.589 --> 01:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
under our federal laws have the right to
 
01:56:54.350 --> 01:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
work here yet there are people who will
 
01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
hire them and they end up hiring them at
 
01:57:00.270 --> 01:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
lower wages because people want to work
 
01:57:01.910 --> 01:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's understandable they're here they
 
01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
want to work and it's easy for somebody
 
01:57:06.270 --> 01:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
who wants to cheat the system to say I'm
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
not going to pay you minimum wage or I'm
 
01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
going to withhold your pay and that
 
01:57:12.189 --> 01:57:12.199 align:start position:0%
person because they don't have legal
 
01:57:15.069 --> 01:57:15.079 align:start position:0%
status to work gets punished for that is
 
01:57:17.109 --> 01:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
that going on you bet it is I think some
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
of you remember about a decade ago one
 
01:57:22.510 --> 01:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
of the larger national food chains was
 
01:57:25.229 --> 01:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
caught with thousands of employees it's
 
01:57:27.470 --> 01:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
an easy trick if you want to find cheap
 
01:57:30.069 --> 01:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
labor and don't want to pay much you
 
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
just skirt this system if it were me I
 
01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:35.159 align:start position:0%
would say every employer should do it
 
01:57:37.390 --> 01:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
it's not that hard to do I am not a
 
01:57:40.270 --> 01:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
computer genius but if I can do it i'
 
01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
say that's a baseline I again I'm I'm
 
01:57:45.550 --> 01:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
not hired by anybody I'm not part of the
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
Bia I'm not part of any association I
 
01:57:49.629 --> 01:57:49.639 align:start position:0%
have lots of good friends on the other
 
01:57:51.149 --> 01:57:51.159 align:start position:0%
side I think I'm a pretty strong
 
01:57:53.950 --> 01:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
supporter of civil liberties but I just
 
01:57:56.030 --> 01:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's an easy protection to make sure
 
01:57:58.069 --> 01:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
that workers aren't exploited who don't
 
01:58:00.510 --> 01:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
have the right yet to work here and at
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
the same time giving a shield to
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
employers it's worked very well for us
 
01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
it is not burdensome and I just thought
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
I'd make sure I offered that testimony
 
01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
because I know you debate this issue
 
01:58:13.750 --> 01:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
often all right thank you very much I do
 
01:58:16.109 --> 01:58:16.119 align:start position:0%
have a question you uh testified that
 
01:58:18.750 --> 01:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
you initially adopted this voluntarily
 
01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
have you found found um that some of the
 
01:58:24.589 --> 01:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
contracts that you engage in require it
 
01:58:26.990 --> 01:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
like a federal contract absolutely yeah
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
we provide janitorial services in some
 
01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
federal and state uh buildings where
 
01:58:34.510 --> 01:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
we're required to pass a higher security
 
01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
level and we are required if we work I
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not the HR department with 300
 
01:58:43.350 --> 01:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
Associates I'm just a reformed lawyer um
 
01:58:45.149 --> 01:58:45.159 align:start position:0%
but uh in some of our federal contracts
 
01:58:47.550 --> 01:58:47.560 align:start position:0%
we are absolutely required to all right
 
01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
love thank you for your testimony thank
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh you mentioned a 2% false
 
01:58:59.709 --> 01:58:59.719 align:start position:0%
positive do you know if there's a a way
 
01:59:02.310 --> 01:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
to for a potential employee to uh to
 
01:59:04.750 --> 01:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
straighten that mess out there is but
 
01:59:06.510 --> 01:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to In fairness it's very
 
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
burdensome okay um I I'll be honest if
 
01:59:11.109 --> 01:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
you have somebody here who doesn't
 
01:59:13.270 --> 01:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
English isn't their first language
 
01:59:15.229 --> 01:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
they're trying to navigate uh being in
 
01:59:18.990 --> 01:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
this country um it is difficult to do
 
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
and uh as noted by a previous speaker I
 
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
am sure there are some employers who
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
once they get that false positive back
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
maybe don't report that in our case we
 
01:59:30.669 --> 01:59:30.679 align:start position:0%
are so grateful to have anybody who
 
01:59:32.830 --> 01:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
wants to work and show up if we get a
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
false one we try and work through it and
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
usually get them resolved does that take
 
01:59:42.149 --> 01:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
yes other questions was there a hand
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
over here all right representative
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
ccum thank you thank you very much Mr
 
01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for that answer can
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
I just follow up on one thing are you
 
01:59:55.229 --> 01:59:55.239 align:start position:0%
allowed to still hire them while you
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
fixing that process or is that
 
01:59:59.830 --> 01:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
preventing you from hiring them we
 
02:00:02.990 --> 02:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
don't we we'd rather be safe than sorry
 
02:00:04.950 --> 02:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
I mean we're we're large enough that we
 
02:00:06.830 --> 02:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
get lots of audits from lots of
 
02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
departments and we are on the side of
 
02:00:12.030 --> 02:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
safety you can usually resolve it in a
 
02:00:14.430 --> 02:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
in a fairly short time but you have to
 
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
take the effort follow follow but you
 
02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
you're not sure if you are allowed I
 
02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
can't remember I I just can't that's so
 
02:00:24.990 --> 02:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
far beyond my pay
 
02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
grade I have very minimal competencies
 
02:00:29.470 --> 02:00:29.480 align:start position:0%
I'm the Vana White of my organization
 
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
which tells you we're probably in
 
02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
trouble was there a question over
 
02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
here no uh representative Al thank you
 
02:00:40.069 --> 02:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman good to see you again Mr
 
02:00:42.390 --> 02:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
dpri thank you
 
02:00:46.069 --> 02:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
sir so you use you adopted EFI a long
 
02:00:47.669 --> 02:00:47.679 align:start position:0%
time ago yeah um you've worked through
 
02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:49.719 align:start position:0%
some false positives um um on those
 
02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
false positives would they have passed
 
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
the I9 Check Yes some do thank you thank
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman not all but some do and
 
02:01:00.790 --> 02:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
our goal is just to make sure that
 
02:01:02.470 --> 02:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
everybody who works we're protected from
 
02:01:05.350 --> 02:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
any liability and like I say I do know I
 
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
am sure I know in the hospitality
 
02:01:10.350 --> 02:01:10.360 align:start position:0%
industry there are people who are hired
 
02:01:12.750 --> 02:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
who aren't eligible to work and then
 
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
they are frankly uh they're not treated
 
02:01:20.750 --> 02:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
fairly other question
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again for your Tes
 
02:01:24.069 --> 02:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate your service good
 
02:01:27.790 --> 02:01:27.800 align:start position:0%
luck everyone so um as I said that was
 
02:01:30.069 --> 02:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
the last pink card that I had if there
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
are no more um people wishing to
 
02:01:36.430 --> 02:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
tesy representative if you could
 
02:01:38.510 --> 02:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
find the blue sheet for this bill and
 
02:01:39.550 --> 02:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
pass it
 
02:01:43.950 --> 02:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
forward and I thought I saw
 
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:51.390 align:start position:0%
 
online

02:01:51.390 --> 02:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:53.310 --> 02:01:53.320 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
you so I was um asked
 
02:02:15.270 --> 02:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
to uh get a copy of the online signin
 
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
because as most of us probably realize
 
02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:20.719 align:start position:0%
now a lot more people go on to the
 
02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
website to indicate their opposition or
 
02:02:25.870 --> 02:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
support of a bill than actually come
 
02:02:28.709 --> 02:02:28.719 align:start position:0%
here and sign the blue sheet these days
 
02:02:32.350 --> 02:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh one caveat uh with the numbers on
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
that is that when there is online
 
02:02:39.550 --> 02:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
testimony for a bill that remains open
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
um until midnight so these will not be
 
02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
the final numbers this will be what we
 
02:02:47.550 --> 02:02:47.560 align:start position:0%
had uh whenever we printed them out so
 
02:02:49.870 --> 02:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
there were only two signin on the blue
 
02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
sheet uh one of them was uh one of our
 
02:02:56.109 --> 02:02:56.119 align:start position:0%
speakers the other one uh signed in in
 
02:02:59.629 --> 02:02:59.639 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill and then let me
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
can does this there it is it's at the
 
02:03:13.589 --> 02:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
top so signing in online we had two in
 
02:03:16.709 --> 02:03:16.719 align:start position:0%
support and 109 in
 
02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
opposition so with that I will close the
 
02:03:22.629 --> 02:03:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:25.270 --> 02:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
hb110 and that covers us through
 
02:03:29.229 --> 02:03:29.239 align:start position:0%
lunchtime we will res uh recess until
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:56.030 align:start position:0%
 
bill

02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:57.669 --> 02:03:57.679 align:start position:0%
that we
 
02:03:57.679 --> 02:04:00.229 align:start position:0%
that we
discussed

02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
02:04:00.239 --> 02:04:06.830 align:start position:0%
discussed
it's

02:04:06.830 --> 02:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
I and one of the
 
02:04:12.510 --> 02:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
things you can't just in and out you
 
02:04:17.790 --> 02:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:17.800 --> 03:31:24.870 align:start position:0%
 
I

03:31:24.870 --> 03:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:26.990 --> 03:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
all right we'll open the hearing on uh
 
03:31:27.000 --> 03:31:28.030 align:start position:0%
all right we'll open the hearing on uh
Bill

03:31:28.030 --> 03:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:31:31.590 --> 03:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
1201 1:00 uh calling representative
 
03:31:38.429 --> 03:31:38.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:41.349 --> 03:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
Testimony thank you Mr chairman uh for
 
03:31:43.269 --> 03:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
again for the record my name is
 
03:31:44.950 --> 03:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative Brian seaworth I
 
03:31:47.950 --> 03:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Pembrook and I'm
 
03:31:52.550 --> 03:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
here today to introduce my bill HB
 
03:31:56.030 --> 03:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
121 um this is a bill that's been
 
03:31:59.309 --> 03:31:59.319 align:start position:0%
nagging at me for years now and I
 
03:32:01.309 --> 03:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
finally decided this was the year to put
 
03:32:06.630 --> 03:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
it in I I think fixing this RSA is
 
03:32:11.030 --> 03:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
important and um it's a good time to to
 
03:32:14.150 --> 03:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
do it I also put it in because I I think
 
03:32:17.469 --> 03:32:17.479 align:start position:0%
this is an easy bill um I may not have
 
03:32:20.870 --> 03:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
gotten the language perfect but I really
 
03:32:22.990 --> 03:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
think the people on this committee are
 
03:32:26.150 --> 03:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
the right ones to um make sure that we
 
03:32:27.910 --> 03:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
get this policy
 
03:32:31.110 --> 03:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
right uh I'll go a little bit into some
 
03:32:34.630 --> 03:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
of the background of uh where this came
 
03:32:37.670 --> 03:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
from uh hopefully not get too into the
 
03:32:42.510 --> 03:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
weeds but first uh so what is this RSA
 
03:32:46.229 --> 03:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
this is a section of law that deals with
 
03:32:50.349 --> 03:32:50.359 align:start position:0%
what happens when an employee dies while
 
03:32:52.910 --> 03:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
working and is owed money by the
 
03:32:56.830 --> 03:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
employer and the law says that under
 
03:33:00.469 --> 03:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
certain conditions the employer May pay
 
03:33:04.910 --> 03:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
out that owed money directly to the air
 
03:33:07.110 --> 03:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
of the deceased employee without going
 
03:33:10.950 --> 03:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
through probate and to kind of simplify
 
03:33:13.830 --> 03:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh there are three conditions one is
 
03:33:17.150 --> 03:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
it's May it's a may be paid so if there
 
03:33:19.790 --> 03:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
are reasons that the two parties think
 
03:33:22.309 --> 03:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
it it should go through probate they're
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
not required to pay
 
03:33:27.710 --> 03:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
directly number
 
03:33:31.790 --> 03:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
two um if the estate is already in
 
03:33:34.469 --> 03:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
Probate for other reasons then you must
 
03:33:37.990 --> 03:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
go through that process number three the
 
03:33:41.670 --> 03:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
amount has to be $300 or less
 
03:33:43.229 --> 03:33:43.239 align:start position:0%
and when I've explained what I'm doing
 
03:33:45.349 --> 03:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
to people that's usually where I get the
 
03:33:48.150 --> 03:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
funny look cuz that it just doesn't make
 
03:33:50.630 --> 03:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
sense it's such a small amount of money
 
03:33:53.710 --> 03:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
that you wonder well why cap it there
 
03:33:55.510 --> 03:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
and the answer is also
 
03:33:59.349 --> 03:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
simple this law uh it dates back to the
 
03:34:02.910 --> 03:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
30s um it was last changed in
 
03:34:06.990 --> 03:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
1963 and since 1963 the dollar has lost
 
03:34:11.389 --> 03:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
north of 90% of its value so
 
03:34:17.710 --> 03:34:17.720 align:start position:0%
$300 in 63 in1 1963 is worth and and my
 
03:34:21.910 --> 03:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
guess was about 10 times that today so
 
03:34:26.150 --> 03:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
that's the change that I made um part of
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
what I did is I wanted to be
 
03:34:27.840 --> 03:34:29.670 align:start position:0%
what I did is I wanted to be
conservative

03:34:29.670 --> 03:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
conservative
 
03:34:33.990 --> 03:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
with um mirroring the intent of the law
 
03:34:37.309 --> 03:34:37.319 align:start position:0%
as it stood in 1963 not make some
 
03:34:41.670 --> 03:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
unintended changes so I tried to work on
 
03:34:43.189 --> 03:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
how I got that
 
03:34:46.510 --> 03:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
number um so let me just go back through
 
03:34:51.630 --> 03:34:51.640 align:start position:0%
how this bill came to us um the RSA is
 
03:34:54.229 --> 03:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
actually what's in the bill is the full
 
03:34:56.950 --> 03:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
RSA this isn't there isn't other
 
03:34:58.790 --> 03:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
relevant sections that are outside of
 
03:35:02.710 --> 03:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
that um it was part of a process uh
 
03:35:07.150 --> 03:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
about five years ago now when we
 
03:35:09.950 --> 03:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
established a legislative study
 
03:35:12.790 --> 03:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
committee to look at labor laws that
 
03:35:12.800 --> 03:35:14.389 align:start position:0%
committee to look at labor laws that
were

03:35:14.389 --> 03:35:14.399 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:35:17.990 --> 03:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
archaic and then chairman
 
03:35:21.309 --> 03:35:21.319 align:start position:0%
Sullivan uh came up with some excellent
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
ideas that limited the scope we focused
 
03:35:26.710 --> 03:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
on wage and hour and protective
 
03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
legislation and we focused on items that
 
03:35:33.349 --> 03:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor could identify
 
03:35:35.590 --> 03:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
as problematic and brought to
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
us this was one of those sections that
 
03:35:41.510 --> 03:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor flag
 
03:35:43.950 --> 03:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
the reason that they said they flagged
 
03:35:47.630 --> 03:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
it is that it's one of those areas where
 
03:35:49.510 --> 03:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
they got a lot of questions people call
 
03:35:51.910 --> 03:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
up and you can see the language that's
 
03:35:53.830 --> 03:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
here it's a it's a bit esoteric and
 
03:35:55.870 --> 03:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
people say I don't understand what I'm
 
03:35:58.229 --> 03:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
looking at could you help me so that's
 
03:36:00.950 --> 03:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
why they brought it to us in that
 
03:36:04.150 --> 03:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
committee as we worked on it one of the
 
03:36:07.990 --> 03:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
issues is some of these this language
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
like letters
 
03:36:12.309 --> 03:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
testamentary uh or of
 
03:36:12.319 --> 03:36:14.790 align:start position:0%
testamentary uh or of
administration

03:36:14.790 --> 03:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
administration
 
03:36:18.389 --> 03:36:18.399 align:start position:0%
um the the pendency of probate
 
03:36:21.349 --> 03:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
proceedings these are legal terms of Art
 
03:36:23.510 --> 03:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
and we were concerned that so if you
 
03:36:25.910 --> 03:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
don't know probate this is very
 
03:36:28.590 --> 03:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
confusing if you do know what it means
 
03:36:31.870 --> 03:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
it's very precise and we didn't want to
 
03:36:36.110 --> 03:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
go paraphrasing precise legal terms and
 
03:36:38.469 --> 03:36:38.479 align:start position:0%
potentially creating Fallout but we did
 
03:36:41.389 --> 03:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
immediately focus on this 300 $100
 
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
number at the time though we couldn't
 
03:36:45.990 --> 03:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
really agree on what the right number
 
03:36:48.670 --> 03:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
was so the suggestion from that
 
03:36:51.150 --> 03:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
committee back when was that this should
 
03:36:51.160 --> 03:36:52.030 align:start position:0%
committee back when was that this should
be

03:36:52.030 --> 03:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:36:55.790 --> 03:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
amended but we don't know what to um so
 
03:36:58.630 --> 03:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
the 3,000 as I said it's easy enough you
 
03:37:01.510 --> 03:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
can find a lot of calculators online
 
03:37:04.189 --> 03:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
that you can say what is
 
03:37:08.309 --> 03:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
1963 uh $300 in 1963 worth in today's
 
03:37:11.110 --> 03:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
dollars and it uses the inflation number
 
03:37:15.590 --> 03:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
it comes up around 10 I also looked at
 
03:37:18.469 --> 03:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
wages and I sent some documents around
 
03:37:20.990 --> 03:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
that I had used in case you want to kind
 
03:37:23.070 --> 03:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
of see where I was coming from that
 
03:37:24.870 --> 03:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
again it was kind of an order of
 
03:37:27.590 --> 03:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
magnitude between what people were paid
 
03:37:32.189 --> 03:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
for a similar job in 63 as today the
 
03:37:34.910 --> 03:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
other thing I looked at is what
 
03:37:39.189 --> 03:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
$3,000 is in terms of the average wage
 
03:37:41.590 --> 03:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
and I sent that in the email mail if if
 
03:37:44.950 --> 03:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's the mean wage it's
 
03:37:49.429 --> 03:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
about um 2 and 1 half weeks of pay will
 
03:37:52.469 --> 03:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
make $3,000 at the median wage it's more
 
03:37:56.469 --> 03:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
like three weeks so this all the $3,000
 
03:37:59.189 --> 03:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
feels kind of right to me in that it's
 
03:38:03.710 --> 03:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
more than a bi-weekly paycheck for most
 
03:38:05.830 --> 03:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
people the other thing that I wanted to
 
03:38:08.750 --> 03:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
point out is I did make some change to
 
03:38:10.950 --> 03:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
the uh last
 
03:38:14.070 --> 03:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
sentence which basically was saying that
 
03:38:20.150 --> 03:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
if there is no um will or probate that
 
03:38:23.790 --> 03:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
specifies who the heir is then you use
 
03:38:26.189 --> 03:38:26.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law to figure it out and
 
03:38:29.150 --> 03:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
so I went to OS and said can't we just
 
03:38:31.510 --> 03:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
point people to the New Hampshire law
 
03:38:33.309 --> 03:38:33.319 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to describe it and
 
03:38:36.269 --> 03:38:36.279 align:start position:0%
they came back with this um last line
 
03:38:39.070 --> 03:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
and bold which makes sense to
 
03:38:42.070 --> 03:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
me um so with that I think I've talked
 
03:38:44.510 --> 03:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
enough I'd be happy to answer questions
 
03:38:44.520 --> 03:38:45.269 align:start position:0%
enough I'd be happy to answer questions
on

03:38:45.269 --> 03:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:38:48.070 --> 03:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
this representative biry thank you Mr
 
03:38:52.710 --> 03:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
chairman um does this $3,000 count like
 
03:38:57.070 --> 03:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
unpaid vacation and sick time and uh any
 
03:39:02.830 --> 03:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:06.389 --> 03:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
so my understanding and and one issue is
 
03:39:09.030 --> 03:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
I would have a hard time answering how
 
03:39:11.550 --> 03:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
this law is interpreted today and that's
 
03:39:14.750 --> 03:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
the key is that at least my goal here
 
03:39:18.389 --> 03:39:18.399 align:start position:0%
was not to change the interpretation of
 
03:39:20.990 --> 03:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
the law but to update it so that it
 
03:39:24.590 --> 03:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
applies as intended as I read it it's
 
03:39:28.030 --> 03:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
any money that the employer owes the
 
03:39:31.990 --> 03:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
employee through employment
 
03:39:35.189 --> 03:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
not restricted to some categories but
 
03:39:38.189 --> 03:39:38.199 align:start position:0%
not others one of the issues we have
 
03:39:40.870 --> 03:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
here is now that it's down to
 
03:39:44.590 --> 03:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
$300 I'd imagine there isn't a lot of
 
03:39:49.229 --> 03:39:49.239 align:start position:0%
current um experience as to what happens
 
03:39:51.710 --> 03:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
and where people you know try to figure
 
03:39:55.469 --> 03:39:55.479 align:start position:0%
this out so that's one of the when we
 
03:39:58.910 --> 03:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
move it back up to a a relevant number
 
03:40:00.309 --> 03:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
we might see
 
03:40:03.150 --> 03:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
people things that haven't happened in
 
03:40:05.429 --> 03:40:05.439 align:start position:0%
many years
 
03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
now coming to the four again my belief
 
03:40:13.349 --> 03:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
is that um though it would cover any
 
03:40:15.790 --> 03:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
money due the
 
03:40:18.590 --> 03:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
employee oh yeah thank you Mr chairman
 
03:40:22.790 --> 03:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
you think $3,000 is enough if you have
 
03:40:25.750 --> 03:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
three weeks pay coming 3 weeks vacation
 
03:40:30.349 --> 03:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
coming uh four unused sick days that
 
03:40:32.870 --> 03:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
could go way over
 
03:40:35.790 --> 03:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
$3,000 thank you for that question and
 
03:40:39.070 --> 03:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
and I agree and as I said part of what I
 
03:40:41.710 --> 03:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
was trying to do
 
03:40:45.070 --> 03:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
was um think about all the opinions that
 
03:40:47.150 --> 03:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
we had when we discussed this in in the
 
03:40:51.750 --> 03:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
committee um I personally would be happy
 
03:40:54.070 --> 03:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
going higher there was a member of the
 
03:40:56.269 --> 03:40:56.279 align:start position:0%
committee that felt you know you could
 
03:40:58.550 --> 03:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
have potentially some very big if
 
03:41:00.870 --> 03:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
somebody's on commission and is owed a
 
03:41:02.630 --> 03:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
very large commission the the money
 
03:41:04.429 --> 03:41:04.439 align:start position:0%
could get substantial and there was some
 
03:41:08.070 --> 03:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
concern about well is there a number
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
that that's too high and you want to
 
03:41:13.309 --> 03:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
force it through probate because of the
 
03:41:17.070 --> 03:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
complexity um and that's why I don't
 
03:41:19.150 --> 03:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
think this is a partisan bill I don't
 
03:41:21.830 --> 03:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
think this is a political bill but I do
 
03:41:24.269 --> 03:41:24.279 align:start position:0%
think this will be a a good bill to
 
03:41:26.349 --> 03:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
discuss in committee and try to figure
 
03:41:29.710 --> 03:41:29.720 align:start position:0%
this out uh one suggestion that another
 
03:41:31.309 --> 03:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
member of the committee who's not here
 
03:41:34.590 --> 03:41:34.600 align:start position:0%
made to me um that might make sense is
 
03:41:37.030 --> 03:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
rather than set a new dollar amount
 
03:41:39.469 --> 03:41:39.479 align:start position:0%
which will start to become obsolete as
 
03:41:41.910 --> 03:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
soon as we get some new inflation is
 
03:41:46.349 --> 03:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
maybe you do tie it to pay periods that
 
03:41:48.229 --> 03:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
03:41:48.239 --> 03:41:49.990 align:start position:0%
you know that
it's

03:41:49.990 --> 03:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:41:53.349 --> 03:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
a a two- week pay or half the monthly
 
03:41:56.229 --> 03:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
pay or something and and using either an
 
03:41:58.830 --> 03:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
average or his suggestion was actually
 
03:42:02.309 --> 03:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
look at the workers you know whatever
 
03:42:06.510 --> 03:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
your your monthly amount is you set the
 
03:42:08.750 --> 03:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
limit according to that so these are
 
03:42:10.670 --> 03:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
options that
 
03:42:12.309 --> 03:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
I think you've identified a good point
 
03:42:14.110 --> 03:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
and there might be some good ways to
 
03:42:16.710 --> 03:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
solve it okay quick followup Yeah final
 
03:42:20.389 --> 03:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
final followup thanks if if we had a cap
 
03:42:24.309 --> 03:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
say 3,000 and there's money left over we
 
03:42:27.189 --> 03:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
could use a 3,000 payable right away and
 
03:42:29.710 --> 03:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
arrest go into probate with everything
 
03:42:33.510 --> 03:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
else interesting question and again um I
 
03:42:36.630 --> 03:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
would probably defer to a lawyer or
 
03:42:38.870 --> 03:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
someone who knows how this was handled
 
03:42:41.429 --> 03:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
cuz I I could could interpret in either
 
03:42:44.189 --> 03:42:44.199 align:start position:0%
way that you can pay up to 3,000 and
 
03:42:46.710 --> 03:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
withhold a less or you could read this
 
03:42:48.750 --> 03:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
to say if it's more than
 
03:42:51.030 --> 03:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
3,000 all of it has to go through
 
03:42:54.630 --> 03:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
probate and I I can't answer how the
 
03:42:56.469 --> 03:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
existing law would be
 
03:42:56.479 --> 03:42:59.269 align:start position:0%
existing law would be
interpreted

03:42:59.269 --> 03:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
interpreted
 
03:43:01.349 --> 03:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
okay one final thought one final
 
03:43:03.630 --> 03:43:03.640 align:start position:0%
followup yeah well only because if it's
 
03:43:06.630 --> 03:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
a young person they may not have enough
 
03:43:08.510 --> 03:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
money put aside for a funeral and all
 
03:43:10.790 --> 03:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
that stuff so they'll need this money up
 
03:43:15.750 --> 03:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
front exactly and I I think that's why
 
03:43:18.910 --> 03:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
passing a good version of this bill
 
03:43:20.389 --> 03:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
however we decide to mend it is
 
03:43:23.309 --> 03:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
important because when a family loses a
 
03:43:26.110 --> 03:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
primary bread winner they're going to
 
03:43:26.120 --> 03:43:26.990 align:start position:0%
primary bread winner they're going to
need

03:43:26.990 --> 03:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:43:33.030 --> 03:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
money now not in six nine months when
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
everything gets worked out with the
 
03:43:36.269 --> 03:43:36.279 align:start position:0%
lawyers thank
 
03:43:39.389 --> 03:43:39.399 align:start position:0%
you representative kill thank you Mr
 
03:43:40.990 --> 03:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
03:43:44.269 --> 03:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I don't see a
 
03:43:47.670 --> 03:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
linkage to 275 colon
 
03:43:50.110 --> 03:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
43 but I think perhaps the department
 
03:43:53.790 --> 03:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
could clarify this disposition of of
 
03:43:56.189 --> 03:43:56.199 align:start position:0%
wages might be pursuant to the policy
 
03:43:58.950 --> 03:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
and practice of the
 
03:44:03.830 --> 03:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
employer um could be maybe um but uh I'm
 
03:44:05.590 --> 03:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
not I'm not I'm not familiar with
 
03:44:09.269 --> 03:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
probate but I I do know that my my uncle
 
03:44:11.070 --> 03:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
passed away and I believe they had a
 
03:44:13.429 --> 03:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
joint account everything was frozen and
 
03:44:16.910 --> 03:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
there was no money at all that my aunt
 
03:44:19.309 --> 03:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
could access to to do anything so I
 
03:44:21.469 --> 03:44:21.479 align:start position:0%
don't it's it's different from the old
 
03:44:22.710 --> 03:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
days when you would when the wife would
 
03:44:24.469 --> 03:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
go down to the mill and pick up the pay
 
03:44:27.590 --> 03:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
envelope whether he was dead or alive
 
03:44:29.550 --> 03:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
and we don't we don't quite do that
 
03:44:31.590 --> 03:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
these days you just the boss would just
 
03:44:33.429 --> 03:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
hand it over to you in the event of the
 
03:44:36.830 --> 03:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
untimely death but uh interesting Bill
 
03:44:38.990 --> 03:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for bringing it and uh yes
 
03:44:41.750 --> 03:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
I know you would believe
 
03:44:45.070 --> 03:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and I I do um I have thought
 
03:44:47.030 --> 03:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
about that that the world has changed a
 
03:44:49.429 --> 03:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
lot with direct deposit and and the way
 
03:44:52.229 --> 03:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
money is transferred and there may be a
 
03:44:55.149 --> 03:44:55.159 align:start position:0%
lot this bill might have a much smaller
 
03:45:00.550 --> 03:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
scope than it did 60 years ago um
 
03:45:04.149 --> 03:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
but I I think if there are some cases
 
03:45:06.910 --> 03:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
where a family can get money sooner
 
03:45:08.910 --> 03:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
rather than later I'd like to be able to
 
03:45:10.630 --> 03:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
help them do it
 
03:45:10.640 --> 03:45:15.550 align:start position:0%
help them do it
thank

03:45:15.550 --> 03:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:19.630 --> 03:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
you um any further questions for uh
 
03:45:23.790 --> 03:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:23.800 --> 03:45:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
1201

03:45:27.830 --> 03:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:30.469 --> 03:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
03:45:33.149 --> 03:45:33.159 align:start position:0%
Sullivan um I'm I'm hoping that perhaps
 
03:45:36.189 --> 03:45:36.199 align:start position:0%
the uh the Department of Labor can help
 
03:45:37.790 --> 03:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
us out with how this is being
 
03:45:40.149 --> 03:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
interpreted now because uh as you just
 
03:45:43.189 --> 03:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
said I suspect the um with direct
 
03:45:46.269 --> 03:45:46.279 align:start position:0%
deposit that that just sort of goes you
 
03:45:49.429 --> 03:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
know on automatic pilot and I would
 
03:45:53.110 --> 03:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
imagine that in the today's world um if
 
03:45:54.830 --> 03:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
somebody's on direct deposit that will
 
03:45:56.750 --> 03:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
be deposited into their account and if
 
03:45:58.149 --> 03:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
it's a joint
 
03:46:01.030 --> 03:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
account um but at any rate maybe the
 
03:46:03.630 --> 03:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
department can give us some current uh
 
03:46:06.070 --> 03:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
practice on
 
03:46:09.349 --> 03:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
this I think we can ask um M mcra to
 
03:46:10.790 --> 03:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
come up
 
03:46:12.550 --> 03:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth uh for
 
03:46:16.550 --> 03:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:18.990 --> 03:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
question representative kill yeah thank
 
03:46:21.349 --> 03:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
you sir uh I wonder if if even the
 
03:46:24.269 --> 03:46:24.279 align:start position:0%
direct direct deposit would the employer
 
03:46:26.990 --> 03:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
upon noticing knowing of the death would
 
03:46:28.510 --> 03:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
he would everything freeze and he
 
03:46:29.990 --> 03:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make the
 
03:46:32.110 --> 03:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
payment I think that's an excellent
 
03:46:34.710 --> 03:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
question and I don't know the answer to
 
03:46:34.720 --> 03:46:37.030 align:start position:0%
question and I don't know the answer to
thank

03:46:37.030 --> 03:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:40.910 --> 03:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
you um given the discussion here maybe
 
03:46:42.229 --> 03:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
getting rid
 
03:46:45.469 --> 03:46:45.479 align:start position:0%
of not an excess of but just a in the
 
03:46:47.229 --> 03:46:47.239 align:start position:0%
event of a death and of an employee
 
03:46:50.550 --> 03:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
wages due by an employer May upon proper
 
03:46:53.149 --> 03:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
demand be paid maybe we get rid of the
 
03:46:53.159 --> 03:46:54.110 align:start position:0%
demand be paid maybe we get rid of the
dollar

03:46:54.110 --> 03:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
03:46:57.149 --> 03:46:57.159 align:start position:0%
amount I am I think that's a great
 
03:47:00.349 --> 03:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
discussion to have the
 
03:47:04.070 --> 03:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
question that I would bring forth from
 
03:47:06.950 --> 03:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
the members of that legislative
 
03:47:10.750 --> 03:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
committee is so what if that due money
 
03:47:12.750 --> 03:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
is a huge commission you you got a
 
03:47:15.030 --> 03:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars on a sales contract
 
03:47:19.750 --> 03:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's due is there a risk
 
03:47:24.269 --> 03:47:24.279 align:start position:0%
with allowing you know maybe my ex-wife
 
03:47:27.110 --> 03:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
and two girlfriends all show up asking
 
03:47:30.469 --> 03:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
for that money is there is there some
 
03:47:33.110 --> 03:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
protection that needs to be in law or is
 
03:47:36.670 --> 03:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
it sufficient to say you know let people
 
03:47:39.070 --> 03:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
deal with it on a case-by Case basis I
 
03:47:41.269 --> 03:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
don't know I think I look to the
 
03:47:43.229 --> 03:47:43.239 align:start position:0%
committee to help
 
03:47:45.870 --> 03:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
me to get this
 
03:47:47.950 --> 03:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
right any further questions for
 
03:47:49.510 --> 03:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
representa C

good

03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%

afternoon okay I'm back on good
 
03:48:23.349 --> 03:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
afternoon my my name is Tracy mcra I'm a
 
03:48:25.630 --> 03:48:25.640 align:start position:0%
uh one of the attorneys and legislative
 
03:48:28.149 --> 03:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
leaz on for the Department of Labor and
 
03:48:29.990 --> 03:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
I am here to answer any questions that
 
03:48:33.630 --> 03:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
you may have on this particular
 
03:48:36.870 --> 03:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
Bill if you want to direct them or I can
 
03:48:38.790 --> 03:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
start whatever is up to you
 
03:48:38.800 --> 03:48:42.429 align:start position:0%
start whatever is up to you
representative

03:48:42.429 --> 03:48:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:46.590 --> 03:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
yes I'm on um the um I guess just
 
03:48:48.590 --> 03:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
looking for any information you can
 
03:48:50.790 --> 03:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
provide on how this is currently being
 
03:48:56.189 --> 03:48:56.199 align:start position:0%
administered um uh whether the $300 is
 
03:48:59.830 --> 03:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
um uh paid out as as the minimum amount
 
03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
and the rest withheld or you know
 
03:49:04.149 --> 03:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
exactly how does this work
 
03:49:08.110 --> 03:49:08.120 align:start position:0%
today I do not actually have a specific
 
03:49:09.830 --> 03:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
answer to that question I can certainly
 
03:49:11.349 --> 03:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
find out and pass around that
 
03:49:15.070 --> 03:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
information to the committee once I do
 
03:49:17.630 --> 03:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh to the best of my knowledge this is
 
03:49:20.110 --> 03:49:20.120 align:start position:0%
not a large issue that comes up at the
 
03:49:21.750 --> 03:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor so it's probably
 
03:49:24.389 --> 03:49:24.399 align:start position:0%
handled at the employer level but I
 
03:49:25.870 --> 03:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
would prefer to check with our
 
03:49:27.389 --> 03:49:27.399 align:start position:0%
Inspection Division and our wage and
 
03:49:29.790 --> 03:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
hour Division and see if they've gotten
 
03:49:31.189 --> 03:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
any kind of issues that come in they're
 
03:49:32.950 --> 03:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
the ones who do the inspections going in
 
03:49:35.590 --> 03:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
and finding out if the employers are
 
03:49:40.429 --> 03:49:40.439 align:start position:0%
complying um the I I'm not an estate
 
03:49:44.910 --> 03:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
lawyer for good reason um but there are
 
03:49:48.149 --> 03:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
rules underneath the estate probate and
 
03:49:51.710 --> 03:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
succession as to what monies can be paid
 
03:49:54.070 --> 03:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
where they can be paid the biggest
 
03:49:56.309 --> 03:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
concern that we discussed at the
 
03:50:00.349 --> 03:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
department on this particular uh issue
 
03:50:03.070 --> 03:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
is if the money is given to the wrong
 
03:50:05.950 --> 03:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
person in other words contrary to
 
03:50:10.269 --> 03:50:10.279 align:start position:0%
5611 or any other way it's a possibility
 
03:50:12.469 --> 03:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
that an employer could end up having to
 
03:50:12.479 --> 03:50:13.710 align:start position:0%
that an employer could end up having to
pay

03:50:13.710 --> 03:50:13.720 align:start position:0%
pay
 
03:50:16.510 --> 03:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
again even though there's actually part
 
03:50:19.630 --> 03:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
two of this statute that specifically
 
03:50:23.429 --> 03:50:23.439 align:start position:0%
says that uh a release and discharge
 
03:50:25.870 --> 03:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
should be provided for the amount paid
 
03:50:27.910 --> 03:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
so if in this particular case let's say
 
03:50:30.070 --> 03:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
the person was owed
 
03:50:33.469 --> 03:50:33.479 align:start position:0%
$5,000 and the employer paid $3,000
 
03:50:35.269 --> 03:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
pursuant to
 
03:50:37.389 --> 03:50:37.399 align:start position:0%
5611 there could be a release and
 
03:50:41.189 --> 03:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
discharge that's uh filed for just that
 
03:50:43.950 --> 03:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
$33,000 it doesn't mean even based on
 
03:50:46.269 --> 03:50:46.279 align:start position:0%
the current statute doesn't mean that
 
03:50:48.030 --> 03:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
the employee will not get another Penny
 
03:50:49.790 --> 03:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
or the deceased will not get another
 
03:50:52.030 --> 03:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
Penny it just means that that amount has
 
03:50:55.189 --> 03:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
been paid and has been satisfied but
 
03:50:57.070 --> 03:50:57.080 align:start position:0%
there were concerns from my colleagues
 
03:50:59.550 --> 03:50:59.560 align:start position:0%
at the department of if something was
 
03:51:03.429 --> 03:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:06.429 --> 03:51:06.439 align:start position:0%
direction Fallout representative um I
 
03:51:09.990 --> 03:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
happen to call up um RSC uh
 
03:51:10.000 --> 03:51:11.269 align:start position:0%
happen to call up um RSC uh
56

03:51:11.269 --> 03:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
56
 
03:51:14.189 --> 03:51:14.199 align:start position:0%
5611 and I would suggest that if you are
 
03:51:16.349 --> 03:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
not an estate lawyer and you're trying
 
03:51:18.510 --> 03:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
to follow
 
03:51:21.950 --> 03:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
5611 you're going to have a problem so
 
03:51:24.349 --> 03:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
employers trying to figure out who to
 
03:51:27.590 --> 03:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
give the money to are going to have a
 
03:51:30.309 --> 03:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
problem I would agree that a state law
 
03:51:32.870 --> 03:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
is a very specialized practice um but
 
03:51:34.510 --> 03:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
because this is actually listed
 
03:51:36.269 --> 03:51:36.279 align:start position:0%
underneath the protective legislation
 
03:51:37.590 --> 03:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
and it's under
 
03:51:39.870 --> 03:51:39.880 align:start position:0%
275 uh they can come to the Department
 
03:51:42.030 --> 03:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
of Labor and there can be some direction
 
03:51:44.510 --> 03:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
given in that respect we would basically
 
03:51:46.469 --> 03:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
have to administer the statute as it is
 
03:51:49.710 --> 03:51:49.720 align:start position:0%
at $300 with the tweaks that um
 
03:51:52.070 --> 03:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth had suggested
 
03:51:55.110 --> 03:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
even we would still have to uh deal with
 
03:51:57.070 --> 03:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
that if it became an issue at the
 
03:51:58.790 --> 03:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
department whether it's at a hearing or
 
03:52:00.790 --> 03:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
just an administrative
 
03:52:03.229 --> 03:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
order so that would assist the employer
 
03:52:06.670 --> 03:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:09.830 --> 03:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
saying any further questions
 
03:52:12.189 --> 03:52:12.199 align:start position:0%
representative Koo Mr chair and thank
 
03:52:14.750 --> 03:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr mcra so would you clarify the the
 
03:52:17.349 --> 03:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
one about the with the vacation and all
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
the other things be included or would be
 
03:52:21.269 --> 03:52:21.279 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the policy and practice of
 
03:52:24.510 --> 03:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
the employer so under 27543 you're
 
03:52:26.790 --> 03:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
looking at payment of wages wages
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
underneath that statute
 
03:52:31.269 --> 03:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
incorporates um paid time off vacation
 
03:52:32.870 --> 03:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
time sick time and any time that's
 
03:52:35.149 --> 03:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
actually owed to the employer the
 
03:52:39.269 --> 03:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
employee excuse me so if the way I I
 
03:52:41.149 --> 03:52:41.159 align:start position:0%
read this bill the way I interpret this
 
03:52:43.550 --> 03:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
bill if the amount of vacation time sick
 
03:52:46.590 --> 03:52:46.600 align:start position:0%
time and whatever else pursuant to the
 
03:52:49.590 --> 03:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
employer uh policy and practice and
 
03:52:51.990 --> 03:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
procedure if the employer does not have
 
03:52:54.510 --> 03:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
a procedure where they pay out sick time
 
03:52:56.030 --> 03:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be given to them
 
03:52:58.429 --> 03:52:58.439 align:start position:0%
just because it's a it's a decedent
 
03:53:01.389 --> 03:53:01.399 align:start position:0%
versus a person who leaves employment
 
03:53:04.269 --> 03:53:04.279 align:start position:0%
voluntarily it has to be by policy and
 
03:53:05.950 --> 03:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
procedure so we would have to look at
 
03:53:07.429 --> 03:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
that aspect of it and look at the
 
03:53:10.269 --> 03:53:10.279 align:start position:0%
practice of that employer
 
03:53:13.030 --> 03:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
but they would be considered wages so up
 
03:53:16.550 --> 03:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
to the 3,000 unless the the amount is is
 
03:53:18.750 --> 03:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
actually tweaked out of the bill up to
 
03:53:21.790 --> 03:53:21.800 align:start position:0%
the 3,000 would be paid pursuant to
 
03:53:24.070 --> 03:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
5611 which in this case if they have a
 
03:53:25.750 --> 03:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
surviving spouse it usually goes to the
 
03:53:28.710 --> 03:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
surviving spouse and and goes from there
 
03:53:32.269 --> 03:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
um but it would include all wages
 
03:53:34.790 --> 03:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
pursuant to practice and procedure of
 
03:53:38.030 --> 03:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
that employer follow uh they would
 
03:53:39.990 --> 03:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
include all those
 
03:53:43.510 --> 03:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
unless there was no precedent or written
 
03:53:43.520 --> 03:53:46.790 align:start position:0%
unless there was no precedent or written
policy

03:53:46.790 --> 03:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:48.830 --> 03:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
correct well that's where when you're
 
03:53:51.030 --> 03:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
having a hearing you're looking at also
 
03:53:53.790 --> 03:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
past practice so if you're talking about
 
03:53:57.309 --> 03:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
past practice where someone becomes uh
 
03:53:58.670 --> 03:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
is no longer
 
03:54:01.950 --> 03:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
alive that's going to obviously be a lot
 
03:54:05.550 --> 03:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
less uh less instances that occur if
 
03:54:07.510 --> 03:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
you're just talking about past practices
 
03:54:09.510 --> 03:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
of when somebody leaves
 
03:54:12.189 --> 03:54:12.199 align:start position:0%
an employer when and if they're getting
 
03:54:14.670 --> 03:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
paid all of their vacation time a
 
03:54:16.590 --> 03:54:16.600 align:start position:0%
portion of their vacation time all or
 
03:54:18.590 --> 03:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
none of their sick time however that
 
03:54:20.710 --> 03:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
works out you're looking at the policy
 
03:54:23.149 --> 03:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
and the practice for that you're not
 
03:54:25.070 --> 03:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
going to have a lot of fall back on
 
03:54:27.389 --> 03:54:27.399 align:start position:0%
people who are deceased and need to have
 
03:54:29.590 --> 03:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
that payment so I can see where that
 
03:54:32.229 --> 03:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
would be a little bit difficult but I I
 
03:54:34.110 --> 03:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
in my opinion the hearing officers and
 
03:54:35.910 --> 03:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
the inspectors would be able to
 
03:54:38.149 --> 03:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
administer that with without too much
 
03:54:38.159 --> 03:54:39.910 align:start position:0%
administer that with without too much
difficulty

03:54:39.910 --> 03:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
difficulty
 
03:54:39.920 --> 03:54:41.469 align:start position:0%
difficulty
thank

03:54:41.469 --> 03:54:41.479 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:54:45.830 --> 03:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
you any further questions for Mr
 
03:54:48.910 --> 03:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
mcra I have one it's off of what
 
03:54:53.030 --> 03:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan said earlier um
 
03:54:57.349 --> 03:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
if direct deposit automatically finds
 
03:54:59.349 --> 03:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
out that their deceased pays that all
 
03:55:00.590 --> 03:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
their time puts drops it in their
 
03:55:03.070 --> 03:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
checking account somebody comes along
 
03:55:06.070 --> 03:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
and asks for a demand of this or we've
 
03:55:08.269 --> 03:55:08.279 align:start position:0%
already paid it does this any any
 
03:55:09.950 --> 03:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
protections for the employer saying hey
 
03:55:12.469 --> 03:55:12.479 align:start position:0%
you know I've done all this you know not
 
03:55:14.110 --> 03:55:14.120 align:start position:0%
knowing about this law we just pay them
 
03:55:15.429 --> 03:55:15.439 align:start position:0%
all our stuff because they're died and
 
03:55:18.429 --> 03:55:18.439 align:start position:0%
we deposited in their not countdown
 
03:55:20.710 --> 03:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
record would the would the employer have
 
03:55:23.630 --> 03:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
to pay a second time it's
 
03:55:26.149 --> 03:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
possible I can't say that definitively
 
03:55:28.309 --> 03:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
it will depend on the facts on the
 
03:55:30.510 --> 03:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
record when was the employer given
 
03:55:32.469 --> 03:55:32.479 align:start position:0%
notice was the employer given notice
 
03:55:34.790 --> 03:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
after the payment was issued or was the
 
03:55:36.510 --> 03:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
employer given notice prior to the
 
03:55:39.469 --> 03:55:39.479 align:start position:0%
payment being issued um the employers
 
03:55:41.070 --> 03:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
are responsible for making sure that
 
03:55:43.110 --> 03:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
they understand what the current laws
 
03:55:46.389 --> 03:55:46.399 align:start position:0%
are as they relate to their business and
 
03:55:49.030 --> 03:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
so therefore they should know that and I
 
03:55:50.590 --> 03:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
understand that this is a should but it
 
03:55:52.070 --> 03:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't always happen this way they
 
03:55:53.630 --> 03:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
should know that if there is a payment
 
03:55:56.550 --> 03:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
that needs to go to um a deedon or a
 
03:55:59.070 --> 03:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
decedent estate how that's supposed to
 
03:56:01.830 --> 03:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
be handled so it really depends on the
 
03:56:03.590 --> 03:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
facts that are presented it present it
 
03:56:05.510 --> 03:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
depends on the evidence that's presented
 
03:56:07.110 --> 03:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not that employer could
 
03:56:09.309 --> 03:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
be subject to having to repay that
 
03:56:18.349 --> 03:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:20.269 --> 03:56:20.279 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so let's say the employe
 
03:56:21.670 --> 03:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
does employee doesn't show up anymore
 
03:56:23.550 --> 03:56:23.560 align:start position:0%
and it's the end of the pay period they
 
03:56:23.560 --> 03:56:24.950 align:start position:0%
and it's the end of the pay period they
automatically

03:56:24.950 --> 03:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
03:56:28.189 --> 03:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
pay that uh employee say it's a Friday
 
03:56:29.710 --> 03:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
and that you know Saturday closes the
 
03:56:31.910 --> 03:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
week and they don't find out till the
 
03:56:34.189 --> 03:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
following week that that employee is now
 
03:56:36.070 --> 03:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
deceased and they automatically
 
03:56:38.030 --> 03:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
deposited on you know midnight Saturday
 
03:56:40.710 --> 03:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:43.149 --> 03:56:43.159 align:start position:0%
so the employee doesn't have protections
 
03:56:45.590 --> 03:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
prior to notification so they would have
 
03:56:48.349 --> 03:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
to repay that to the air the employer
 
03:56:51.510 --> 03:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
has an argument to say that they've
 
03:56:53.550 --> 03:56:53.560 align:start position:0%
already made this payment they'll have a
 
03:56:55.870 --> 03:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
copy of their payroll information
 
03:56:57.750 --> 03:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
they'll have a copy of their stub
 
03:56:59.830 --> 03:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
they'll show that the direct deposit was
 
03:57:02.910 --> 03:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
made that it was processed by the bank
 
03:57:05.590 --> 03:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
they'll have evidence to show that on
 
03:57:07.910 --> 03:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
Friday before they had any knowledge of
 
03:57:09.510 --> 03:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
the deeding
 
03:57:11.670 --> 03:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
on Friday they issued payment pursuant
 
03:57:15.229 --> 03:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire law and then on Monday
 
03:57:18.189 --> 03:57:18.199 align:start position:0%
they found out that their employee had
 
03:57:20.790 --> 03:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
had died if you have someone from the
 
03:57:25.030 --> 03:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
family that is disputing payment or
 
03:57:28.590 --> 03:57:28.600 align:start position:0%
anything else that is in their favor for
 
03:57:31.030 --> 03:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
evidence how the final ruling goes
 
03:57:34.510 --> 03:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
always depends on facts but that's the
 
03:57:36.710 --> 03:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
way it should be is looking at all of
 
03:57:38.710 --> 03:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
the facts and the employer at that point
 
03:57:40.469 --> 03:57:40.479 align:start position:0%
in time would have
 
03:57:42.469 --> 03:57:42.479 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to use the word
 
03:57:45.189 --> 03:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
protection but would have that ability
 
03:57:48.990 --> 03:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
to defend him or herself based upon the
 
03:57:51.030 --> 03:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
evidence that they present that payment
 
03:57:54.269 --> 03:57:54.279 align:start position:0%
was made in good faith with no knowledge
 
03:57:56.030 --> 03:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any further
 
03:57:59.590 --> 03:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr mcra thank
 
03:58:04.790 --> 03:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
you any more speakers on House Bill
 
03:58:07.349 --> 03:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
1201 seeing none will close the hearing
 
03:58:14.710 --> 03:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:17.030 --> 03:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
dirty Mr
 
03:58:20.590 --> 03:58:20.600 align:start position:0%
chairman representative solivan um it it
 
03:58:22.670 --> 03:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
appears to me that uh based on the
 
03:58:25.229 --> 03:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
discussion we've had so far that this uh
 
03:58:26.750 --> 03:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
Bill sort of Cries Out For A
 
03:58:29.590 --> 03:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I would put I obviously
 
03:58:32.269 --> 03:58:32.279 align:start position:0%
chairman infantine is not here but uh
 
03:58:35.830 --> 03:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps the uh Deputy chair could uh
 
03:58:37.710 --> 03:58:37.720 align:start position:0%
take that to the chair and see if that's
 
03:58:40.110 --> 03:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
something that might
 
03:59:07.429 --> 03:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:07.439 --> 03:59:37.429 align:start position:0%
 
agree

03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:37.439 --> 04:00:07.349 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:00:07.349 --> 04:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:07.359 --> 04:00:37.309 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:00:37.309 --> 04:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:37.319 --> 04:01:07.229 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:01:07.229 --> 04:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:07.239 --> 04:01:37.229 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:01:37.229 --> 04:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:37.239 --> 04:02:06.670 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:02:06.670 --> 04:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:12.550 --> 04:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:17.830 --> 04:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
um so I'll now open the hearing for HB
 
04:02:21.110 --> 04:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
1226 and uh look to the sponsor to
 
04:02:23.510 --> 04:02:23.520 align:start position:0%

bill Mr chairman I am representative

and I'd like to congratulate the
 
04:02:32.030 --> 04:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
chairman for and thank him for having
 
04:02:33.750 --> 04:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
the only hearing I've attended this week
 
04:02:36.950 --> 04:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:39.630 --> 04:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
time I was the one that was two hours
 
04:02:43.950 --> 04:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
past its scheduled time so um I'm here
 
04:02:47.070 --> 04:02:47.080 align:start position:0%
to introduce 1226 FN which is uh
 
04:02:49.229 --> 04:02:49.239 align:start position:0%
relative to employment protections for
 
04:02:49.239 --> 04:02:50.269 align:start position:0%
relative to employment protections for
freelance

04:02:50.269 --> 04:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
freelance
 
04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
employees um this is based on work that
 
04:02:54.590 --> 04:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
is going around the nation right now
 
04:02:56.550 --> 04:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
called the freelance uh employees
 
04:02:59.469 --> 04:02:59.479 align:start position:0%
protection act uh the states of Illinois
 
04:03:03.070 --> 04:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
and New York have adopted the provisions
 
04:03:07.750 --> 04:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
um which some of are in this bill um New
 
04:03:11.030 --> 04:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a growing uh population of
 
04:03:13.550 --> 04:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
freelance workers here in the state and
 
04:03:16.710 --> 04:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns is is that there are
 
04:03:18.830 --> 04:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
that people who work in the freelance
 
04:03:20.710 --> 04:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
industry and I've brought somebody with
 
04:03:22.590 --> 04:03:22.600 align:start position:0%
me here today who will be able to speak
 
04:03:24.670 --> 04:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
much more eloquently than I'm able to
 
04:03:27.830 --> 04:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
who was a freelancer for some 30 20 plus
 
04:03:32.030 --> 04:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
years and um but as New Hampshire grows
 
04:03:33.870 --> 04:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
and as Broadband access becomes more
 
04:03:35.110 --> 04:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
prevalent in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
highspeed Broadband particularly we're
 
04:03:38.590 --> 04:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
going to see more and more Freel workers
 
04:03:40.349 --> 04:03:40.359 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire what
 
04:03:41.429 --> 04:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
they're looking for is certain
 
04:03:43.750 --> 04:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
protections under contracts that they
 
04:03:45.790 --> 04:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
expect to be paid when they when their
 
04:03:47.790 --> 04:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
payments are due uh they expect certain
 
04:03:49.349 --> 04:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
protections and they expect certain
 
04:03:51.630 --> 04:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
requirements within their contracts uh
 
04:03:53.110 --> 04:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
right now contracts tend to be all over
 
04:03:56.070 --> 04:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
the place um and and many times the
 
04:03:58.510 --> 04:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
provisions of contracts are not upheld
 
04:03:59.870 --> 04:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
now the bill that you have before you
 
04:04:01.590 --> 04:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
here I submitted late in the session I
 
04:04:04.189 --> 04:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
was approached to submit this bill I'm
 
04:04:06.990 --> 04:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
not a labor expert so I really didn't
 
04:04:09.149 --> 04:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
know what came out of legislative
 
04:04:10.710 --> 04:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
services or what was actually needed or
 
04:04:12.110 --> 04:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
not I've done a little bit of work and I
 
04:04:13.550 --> 04:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
think that there may be stuff that's
 
04:04:15.030 --> 04:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
lacking here I worked with
 
04:04:16.510 --> 04:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
representative kahill and he worked with
 
04:04:18.389 --> 04:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor and they saying
 
04:04:19.710 --> 04:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
that some of the stuff that's in here is
 
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
already protections under the law and
 
04:04:23.469 --> 04:04:23.479 align:start position:0%
that this may not be the case but I
 
04:04:24.750 --> 04:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
think it's important enough because
 
04:04:26.149 --> 04:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
there are so many workers in the state
 
04:04:28.269 --> 04:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire who are looking for
 
04:04:31.389 --> 04:04:31.399 align:start position:0%
protection uh that um I would maybe not
 
04:04:33.189 --> 04:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
recommend that this bill be passed this
 
04:04:36.309 --> 04:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
year but that' be sent inm study so that
 
04:04:38.429 --> 04:04:38.439 align:start position:0%
the legislature can get involved D in
 
04:04:40.229 --> 04:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
finding a solution for these freelancer
 
04:04:42.510 --> 04:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
workers uh and bring the labor
 
04:04:44.030 --> 04:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
department to the table so we can work
 
04:04:46.070 --> 04:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
with them to come up with a bill uh that
 
04:04:48.349 --> 04:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
would meet New Hampshire's needs under
 
04:04:50.790 --> 04:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
the free freelance protection act um as
 
04:04:52.590 --> 04:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
I said New York and Illinois have have
 
04:04:53.990 --> 04:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
submitted legisl have approved
 
04:04:55.710 --> 04:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
legislation they've adopted legislation
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
based for these protections and we'd
 
04:04:58.750 --> 04:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
like to see similar protections for the
 
04:05:00.910 --> 04:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire for these
 
04:05:03.189 --> 04:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
workers I'll try to answer any questions
 
04:05:04.349 --> 04:05:04.359 align:start position:0%
but I've brought a young lady with me
 
04:05:06.189 --> 04:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
here who can talk to you more about
 
04:05:08.550 --> 04:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
freelance work in New Hampshire
 
04:05:10.349 --> 04:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
very good thank you very much are there
 
04:05:12.830 --> 04:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
any questions for the
 
04:05:16.070 --> 04:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative
 
04:05:18.990 --> 04:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
St um thank you for taking my question
 
04:05:21.269 --> 04:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
um I am not familiar with um the term
 
04:05:23.750 --> 04:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
freelance workers but I I do know about
 
04:05:26.550 --> 04:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
contract workers my son for example was
 
04:05:28.910 --> 04:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
a contract worker working for a video
 
04:05:31.269 --> 04:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
game company and it you know was limited
 
04:05:34.830 --> 04:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
to six months um what's the difference
 
04:05:36.349 --> 04:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
between a freelance worker and a
 
04:05:38.070 --> 04:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
contract worker I I think the pretty
 
04:05:40.349 --> 04:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
much identical uh and the thing is is
 
04:05:41.950 --> 04:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
this is a new section in the ordinance
 
04:05:43.950 --> 04:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
this is be the new section in the rsas
 
04:05:45.870 --> 04:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with contractors and and
 
04:05:48.189 --> 04:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
freelance workers uh and it may be a
 
04:05:50.910 --> 04:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
term that is quite similar uh but again
 
04:05:54.189 --> 04:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
um Sarah can certainly uh correct me if
 
04:05:55.830 --> 04:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong but I think there are similar
 
04:05:58.950 --> 04:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
type employees um you know I at one time
 
04:06:01.070 --> 04:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
years ago I was a contract work worker
 
04:06:03.830 --> 04:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
for a very small time or freelancer and
 
04:06:06.670 --> 04:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes um collecting your checks can
 
04:06:08.670 --> 04:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
take as much time as the entire pay that
 
04:06:12.229 --> 04:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
you're getting so it's a
 
04:06:15.510 --> 04:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
problem was there a hand up over here
 
04:06:17.469 --> 04:06:17.479 align:start position:0%
any further
 
04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
04:06:21.070 --> 04:06:21.080 align:start position:0%

04:06:24.750 --> 04:06:24.760 align:start position:0%

04:07:27.670 --> 04:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
According to some statistics in 2017
 
04:07:30.750 --> 04:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
12.4% of the New Hampshire Workforce um
 
04:07:33.309 --> 04:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
paid self-employment taxs and there is
 
04:07:36.630 --> 04:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
um some um there's some it's a little
 
04:07:38.750 --> 04:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
bit vague I guess between Freelancers
 
04:07:41.630 --> 04:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
and contractors I think many of those um
 
04:07:44.109 --> 04:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
categories fall under the same um
 
04:07:47.349 --> 04:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
working conditions and um one of the
 
04:07:49.429 --> 04:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
main uh elements of that is being
 
04:07:51.149 --> 04:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
responsible for your own benefits and
 
04:07:53.790 --> 04:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
I'll get into that a little bit later um
 
04:07:56.189 --> 04:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
and there there countless studies um
 
04:07:57.870 --> 04:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
I've looked at a lot of different labor
 
04:08:00.349 --> 04:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
organizations um through Academia and
 
04:08:01.790 --> 04:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
there are many many studies about
 
04:08:04.309 --> 04:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
increases of gig workers self-employed
 
04:08:07.469 --> 04:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
freelance workers um around the country
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
uh the IRS also has um studies about the
 
04:08:12.990 --> 04:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
numbers of freelance workers freelancing
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
is a broad term that refers to many
 
04:08:17.189 --> 04:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
types of work across many Industries
 
04:08:19.510 --> 04:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
including media web design and
 
04:08:22.750 --> 04:08:22.760 align:start position:0%
accounting amongst many others um every
 
04:08:24.790 --> 04:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
freelancer has one thing in common
 
04:08:26.429 --> 04:08:26.439 align:start position:0%
they're expected to handle many of the
 
04:08:28.630 --> 04:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
elements of work that that other people
 
04:08:30.510 --> 04:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
take for granted for example they're
 
04:08:32.710 --> 04:08:32.720 align:start position:0%
responsible for their own benefits their
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
employer does not uh pay for their
 
04:08:37.109 --> 04:08:37.119 align:start position:0%
health insurance retirement overhead
 
04:08:39.830 --> 04:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
vacation sick leave or parental leave
 
04:08:42.030 --> 04:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
and we're not eligible for unemployment
 
04:08:44.030 --> 04:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
insurance or workers
 
04:08:46.790 --> 04:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
compensation the system of benefits um
 
04:08:48.670 --> 04:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
such as the ones I just listed are
 
04:08:50.790 --> 04:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
intended to Pro provide safety nets for
 
04:08:53.830 --> 04:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
workers but that's denied to Freelancers
 
04:08:56.109 --> 04:08:56.119 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm here today advocating for the
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
freelance protection act because anyone
 
04:08:59.790 --> 04:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
who follows Trends in the economy can
 
04:09:01.870 --> 04:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
see where our employment models are
 
04:09:03.630 --> 04:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
heading more and more people are pushed
 
04:09:05.870 --> 04:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
out of 9 to5 office or manufacturing
 
04:09:08.030 --> 04:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
work and into flexible work that reaches
 
04:09:10.590 --> 04:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
across several sectors labor laws have
 
04:09:12.830 --> 04:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
been adjusted to keep up um with these
 
04:09:15.389 --> 04:09:15.399 align:start position:0%
new new models of working and there's
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
also hidden cost of freelancing even
 
04:09:20.510 --> 04:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
while people are um usually forced into
 
04:09:22.870 --> 04:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
it freelance workers are responsible for
 
04:09:25.229 --> 04:09:25.239 align:start position:0%
high self-employment taxes investing in
 
04:09:27.030 --> 04:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
their own retirements extensive
 
04:09:30.109 --> 04:09:30.119 align:start position:0%
Financial Accounting formation of llc's
 
04:09:32.750 --> 04:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
legal legal fees marketing Tech
 
04:09:35.630 --> 04:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
equipment it and overhead costs and
 
04:09:37.910 --> 04:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're usually not trained um in
 
04:09:39.510 --> 04:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
administrative skills like the ones I
 
04:09:40.910 --> 04:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
just listed because our training is
 
04:09:42.830 --> 04:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
really in the sector that we're um
 
04:09:44.269 --> 04:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
getting hired
 
04:09:48.670 --> 04:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
for so uh I really love my work a lot
 
04:09:50.229 --> 04:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
I've had some really incredible
 
04:09:52.030 --> 04:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
experiences working in the media and I
 
04:09:54.750 --> 04:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
love my clients um but I have experience
 
04:09:57.590 --> 04:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
working with certain firms who have an
 
04:09:59.229 --> 04:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
understanding that hiring Freelancers is
 
04:10:01.830 --> 04:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
a cost benefit to the company um and the
 
04:10:04.109 --> 04:10:04.119 align:start position:0%
company doesn't have to pay o benefits
 
04:10:06.870 --> 04:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
or overhead I guarantee that the tech
 
04:10:08.870 --> 04:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
industry and other sectors has the same
 
04:10:11.710 --> 04:10:11.720 align:start position:0%
hiring practices the cost burdens then
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
fall on the freelancer who's simply
 
04:10:15.830 --> 04:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
trying to have regular work and regular
 
04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
pay we want to earn a salary from an EXT
 
04:10:20.590 --> 04:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
extremely vulnerable position in the
 
04:10:23.229 --> 04:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
workforce so I'm asking the New
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house labor committee to
 
04:10:26.670 --> 04:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
consider legislation to strengthen labor
 
04:10:28.990 --> 04:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
protections for freelance workers the
 
04:10:30.670 --> 04:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
freelance protection act was
 
04:10:33.149 --> 04:10:33.159 align:start position:0%
successfully passed in Illinois New York
 
04:10:36.030 --> 04:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
state New York City and Los Angeles all
 
04:10:37.950 --> 04:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
Freelancers should at the very minimum
 
04:10:40.670 --> 04:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
have the right to mandator mandatory
 
04:10:42.590 --> 04:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
negotiable contracts be able to
 
04:10:44.910 --> 04:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
negotiate a pay that's commensurate with
 
04:10:46.670 --> 04:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
financial responsibilities and with
 
04:10:48.670 --> 04:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
running a business they should be
 
04:10:50.750 --> 04:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
guaranteed a fair process for timely
 
04:10:53.189 --> 04:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
payments as we've seen from many strikes
 
04:10:54.830 --> 04:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
over the last year in many Industries
 
04:10:56.910 --> 04:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
like Hollywood writer strikes Writers
 
04:10:59.429 --> 04:10:59.439 align:start position:0%
Guild of America Washington Post Media
 
04:11:02.189 --> 04:11:02.199 align:start position:0%

Starbucks International Brotherhood of
 
04:11:06.429 --> 04:11:06.439 align:start position:0%
electric World workers there's a sect of
 
04:11:08.109 --> 04:11:08.119 align:start position:0%
our Workforce that is vulnerable to the
 
04:11:09.910 --> 04:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
whims of lucrative Tech and other
 
04:11:12.269 --> 04:11:12.279 align:start position:0%
sectors companies are making a huge
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
profit and using the hiring of freelance
 
04:11:16.950 --> 04:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
workers as an excuse to deny workers
 
04:11:19.229 --> 04:11:19.239 align:start position:0%
benefit the freelance workers usually do
 
04:11:21.109 --> 04:11:21.119 align:start position:0%
not have a collective organization that
 
04:11:23.550 --> 04:11:23.560 align:start position:0%
can represent our rights that's why I'm
 
04:11:25.269 --> 04:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
asking New Hampshire house labor
 
04:11:27.429 --> 04:11:27.439 align:start position:0%
committee to please reflect and enforce
 
04:11:30.269 --> 04:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
labor regulations for freelance
 
04:11:32.830 --> 04:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
workers thank you for your testimony are
 
04:11:35.510 --> 04:11:35.520 align:start position:0%

04:11:40.479 --> 04:11:42.990 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

04:11:42.990 --> 04:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:43.000 --> 04:11:45.070 align:start position:0%
 
for

04:11:45.070 --> 04:11:45.080 align:start position:0%

you to flush out uh some things as
 
04:11:52.520 --> 04:11:53.510 align:start position:0%
you to flush out uh some things as
relates

04:11:53.510 --> 04:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
relates
 
04:11:56.830 --> 04:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
to uh the union environment um when you
 
04:11:59.109 --> 04:11:59.119 align:start position:0%
say there were no opportunities to
 
04:12:02.550 --> 04:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
participate in and join some of these
 
04:12:04.990 --> 04:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
other organizations to be part of them
 
04:12:08.510 --> 04:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh what distinguishes you as a freelance
 
04:12:11.429 --> 04:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
writer doing uh projects for documentary
 
04:12:13.870 --> 04:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
films and other things like that what is
 
04:12:16.670 --> 04:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
the distinction between you and somebody
 
04:12:19.630 --> 04:12:19.640 align:start position:0%
in the guild or some other organization
 
04:12:22.630 --> 04:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know that would be respon will be
 
04:12:24.309 --> 04:12:24.319 align:start position:0%
getting the benefits in getting all of
 
04:12:27.070 --> 04:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
these kind um a a lot of the people in
 
04:12:29.710 --> 04:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
the position I'm in so I do a wide
 
04:12:32.510 --> 04:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
variety of media work um and my work
 
04:12:35.710 --> 04:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily writing and um I'm a
 
04:12:37.229 --> 04:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
member of The Producers Guild but the
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
producers guilt doesn't Advocate um
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any advocacy role um I'm
 
04:12:44.269 --> 04:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
not I haven't been eligible to join the
 
04:12:46.950 --> 04:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
other groups the writer Guild of America
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
um but to be frank there is a movement
 
04:12:54.870 --> 04:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
towards um having more having a wider um
 
04:12:57.070 --> 04:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
breadth of members of groups like the
 
04:12:59.510 --> 04:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
writer guilds um but as of yet there
 
04:13:03.510 --> 04:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
haven't been and um I work in
 
04:13:06.990 --> 04:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
non-fiction production which is nonunion
 
04:13:09.149 --> 04:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
um and it's always been non-un so the
 
04:13:11.349 --> 04:13:11.359 align:start position:0%
majority of my co-workers have not been
 
04:13:16.590 --> 04:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:18.870 --> 04:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
organizations further
 
04:13:21.109 --> 04:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:13:23.309 --> 04:13:23.319 align:start position:0%
BL thank you for taking my question
 
04:13:26.030 --> 04:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Mr chair um by your
 
04:13:28.189 --> 04:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
description here it sounds like you know
 
04:13:30.990 --> 04:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
in the uh what I've always considered a
 
04:13:32.830 --> 04:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
subcontractor I'm I come from the
 
04:13:34.750 --> 04:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
construction field and it sounds like an
 
04:13:37.149 --> 04:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
awful would that be correct just a
 
04:13:39.229 --> 04:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
subcontract environment there's there's
 
04:13:42.870 --> 04:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
a number of um ways that Freelancers can
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
work there's many many different
 
04:13:46.510 --> 04:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
contracts and I think that's one of the
 
04:13:48.309 --> 04:13:48.319 align:start position:0%
things that makes it really difficult
 
04:13:50.990 --> 04:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
that every contract we have is different
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to have consistency um in
 
04:13:57.109 --> 04:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
income and health insurance with so many
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
different contracts and we often don't
 
04:14:01.510 --> 04:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
have any say these contracts can often
 
04:14:04.149 --> 04:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
be non-negotiable I have you know
 
04:14:05.790 --> 04:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
colleagues who have had to turn down
 
04:14:07.790 --> 04:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
work because they asked to negotiate the
 
04:14:09.710 --> 04:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
contract and the company refused they
 
04:14:13.229 --> 04:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
just said take it or leave it MH similar
 
04:14:15.910 --> 04:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
similar to subcontracting thank
 
04:14:20.229 --> 04:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:23.550 --> 04:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
Selvin my observation is that you're not
 
04:14:27.469 --> 04:14:27.479 align:start position:0%
really asking for much um you're asking
 
04:14:32.590 --> 04:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
um for u a contract so you've got your
 
04:14:35.429 --> 04:14:35.439 align:start position:0%
um the deal in writing so to speak um
 
04:14:38.070 --> 04:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
and you're asking to be paid on a uh in
 
04:14:41.510 --> 04:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
a timely fashion um with regard to um
 
04:14:41.520 --> 04:14:42.189 align:start position:0%
a timely fashion um with regard to um
the

04:14:42.189 --> 04:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:14:44.830 --> 04:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
negotiating contract of course you can
 
04:14:46.429 --> 04:14:46.439 align:start position:0%
negotiate the contract but take it or
 
04:14:48.189 --> 04:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
leave it is sometimes part of
 
04:14:51.149 --> 04:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
negotiating um so you don't necessarily
 
04:14:53.389 --> 04:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
get much there
 
04:14:55.870 --> 04:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
um is there something more that you
 
04:14:58.510 --> 04:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
you're looking for than what I've
 
04:15:01.030 --> 04:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
described um well I think that's part of
 
04:15:03.550 --> 04:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
the reason we're thinking about um
 
04:15:07.109 --> 04:15:07.119 align:start position:0%
interm study um because there are many
 
04:15:09.070 --> 04:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
many elements I mean working as
 
04:15:11.990 --> 04:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
Freelancers in independent capacity is
 
04:15:14.630 --> 04:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
very precarious um you know we don't
 
04:15:17.670 --> 04:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
have vacation or sick leave um I think
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of opportunities for
 
04:15:21.670 --> 04:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
H to have stronger support I also think
 
04:15:23.950 --> 04:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of opportunities for the
 
04:15:27.189 --> 04:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
the supporting Freelancers to um help
 
04:15:29.510 --> 04:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
the economy I think it would be helpful
 
04:15:30.750 --> 04:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have to worry about
 
04:15:32.870 --> 04:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
changing health insurance or you know
 
04:15:34.630 --> 04:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
High self-employment taxes the the
 
04:15:37.070 --> 04:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
income we get is really just our income
 
04:15:38.630 --> 04:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
come but because of the way our
 
04:15:40.030 --> 04:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
companies because of the way our
 
04:15:42.950 --> 04:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
business operates we end up H paying
 
04:15:45.269 --> 04:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
many many you know fees and having a
 
04:15:47.349 --> 04:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
financial burden of operating a small
 
04:15:49.510 --> 04:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
business even though all we really want
 
04:15:51.630 --> 04:15:51.640 align:start position:0%
is an income and you know businesses
 
04:15:53.590 --> 04:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
running a business is very complicated
 
04:15:56.149 --> 04:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
and and costly so I think we're looking
 
04:16:01.750 --> 04:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
for more support and more infrastructure
 
04:16:01.760 --> 04:16:03.309 align:start position:0%
for more support and more infrastructure
follow

04:16:03.309 --> 04:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
follow
 
04:16:06.309 --> 04:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
um you your list of things that you lack
 
04:16:08.109 --> 04:16:08.119 align:start position:0%
is far long than the list of things that
 
04:16:10.830 --> 04:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
this bill provides U I guess is where
 
04:16:15.630 --> 04:16:15.640 align:start position:0%
I'm at and um so I U I'm
 
04:16:17.910 --> 04:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
not I'm not sure where the a study
 
04:16:19.550 --> 04:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
committee could could take this but
 
04:16:23.990 --> 04:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:24.000 --> 04:16:27.109 align:start position:0%
 
idea

04:16:27.109 --> 04:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:29.429 --> 04:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
04:16:32.590 --> 04:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
C thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
04:16:34.990 --> 04:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question I guess to follow up
 
04:16:36.710 --> 04:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
on what representative Sullivan's asking
 
04:16:38.990 --> 04:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit confused also as far as
 
04:16:40.389 --> 04:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
what it is you're looking for on this
 
04:16:43.070 --> 04:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
bill are you looking to contract in
 
04:16:44.910 --> 04:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
insurance benefits and other benefits
 
04:16:47.990 --> 04:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:50.309 --> 04:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
freelancer well I I think there's room
 
04:16:52.510 --> 04:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
to explore that because the financial
 
04:16:55.229 --> 04:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
burden of being a contractor can be very
 
04:16:59.670 --> 04:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
high and um I I think that the companies
 
04:17:02.670 --> 04:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
that are Contracting us um are very
 
04:17:07.109 --> 04:17:07.119 align:start position:0%
lucrative businesses and um they are I
 
04:17:10.229 --> 04:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
think are well aware that they're hiring
 
04:17:11.950 --> 04:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
contractors so they don't have to pay
 
04:17:14.030 --> 04:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
those um Financial burdens and then it
 
04:17:17.429 --> 04:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
falls on the people who are actually not
 
04:17:23.189 --> 04:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:25.950 --> 04:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
work I guess where I struggle
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
with capturing all of that is that a
 
04:17:29.790 --> 04:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
freelancer could work for multiple
 
04:17:31.389 --> 04:17:31.399 align:start position:0%
companies so which company's going to
 
04:17:34.830 --> 04:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
pay the the benefits which one won't but
 
04:17:37.349 --> 04:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
to me just listening to you I guess
 
04:17:38.590 --> 04:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
without putting a little bit more
 
04:17:42.590 --> 04:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
thought um would you maybe agree that
 
04:17:44.070 --> 04:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
you're not charging enough that maybe
 
04:17:46.469 --> 04:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
you need to increase your hourly rate so
 
04:17:48.990 --> 04:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
that you can support your overhead costs
 
04:17:50.469 --> 04:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
just like any other business would do
 
04:17:52.189 --> 04:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
they have to increase their rates to
 
04:17:53.710 --> 04:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
support what their overhead costs are so
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
is that maybe an option you should look
 
04:17:57.030 --> 04:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
at well of course I think about
 
04:17:59.510 --> 04:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
increasing my costs but it is a market
 
04:18:01.790 --> 04:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
and um media work is actually
 
04:18:04.510 --> 04:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
undervalued that it's kind of um taken
 
04:18:06.189 --> 04:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
for granted the skills that often go
 
04:18:08.109 --> 04:18:08.119 align:start position:0%
into media work especially now that
 
04:18:10.189 --> 04:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
everyone has you know a phone on their
 
04:18:13.990 --> 04:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
camera um we really get undervalued in
 
04:18:17.630 --> 04:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
the marketplace very frequently um yeah
 
04:18:19.830 --> 04:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
I've been asked to to do for instance
 
04:18:22.750 --> 04:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
camera work um significantly below what
 
04:18:25.149 --> 04:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
a skilled camera operator does it's it's
 
04:18:26.990 --> 04:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
pretty common I've asked people have
 
04:18:30.349 --> 04:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
asked me to do work for free um for the
 
04:18:32.309 --> 04:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
they said you can do it in exchange for
 
04:18:34.469 --> 04:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
exposure but exposure doesn't actually
 
04:18:37.630 --> 04:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
pay my bills so you know the
 
04:18:39.630 --> 04:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
I I did say no I did I don't work for
 
04:18:41.710 --> 04:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
free but that it's kind of a culture in
 
04:18:44.750 --> 04:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
our industry that that media work is and
 
04:18:47.550 --> 04:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
the work I do is very skilled I I do
 
04:18:50.189 --> 04:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
negotiate licensing contracts so I it
 
04:18:53.630 --> 04:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
requires um legal skills it requires
 
04:18:55.870 --> 04:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
historic research it requires technical
 
04:18:59.269 --> 04:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
skills and um and it's it's just
 
04:19:03.070 --> 04:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:06.389 --> 04:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
please Representative Bob L thank you Mr
 
04:19:07.630 --> 04:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Miss Cass for being
 
04:19:10.309 --> 04:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
here with us today um the question I
 
04:19:12.670 --> 04:19:12.680 align:start position:0%
have is it looks like you're asking for
 
04:19:14.990 --> 04:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
employment protections employee
 
04:19:17.389 --> 04:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
protections and try to still be a
 
04:19:17.399 --> 04:19:18.830 align:start position:0%
protections and try to still be a
independent

04:19:18.830 --> 04:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
independent
 
04:19:21.550 --> 04:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
contractor am I correct in
 
04:19:24.870 --> 04:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
that well I guess the term is um
 
04:19:28.670 --> 04:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
employment um but
 
04:19:31.870 --> 04:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
it's the I mean we're Freelancers I I
 
04:19:33.870 --> 04:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
we're not employees of these companies
 
04:19:37.269 --> 04:19:37.279 align:start position:0%
so um I would remove the term employment
 
04:19:40.269 --> 04:19:40.279 align:start position:0%
but because we're rly employed by
 
04:19:43.309 --> 04:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
companies follow Mr chairman follow so
 
04:19:45.070 --> 04:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
can you define the difference between a
 
04:19:47.229 --> 04:19:47.239 align:start position:0%
freelancer and a staff position why
 
04:19:48.630 --> 04:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
would you take a staff position so you
 
04:19:50.550 --> 04:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
can get your employee protections your
 
04:19:51.910 --> 04:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
health insurance and all your sick time
 
04:19:53.790 --> 04:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
and everything else paid and work for
 
04:19:56.070 --> 04:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
just one company or is freelancing what
 
04:19:57.910 --> 04:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
you want to do and it's your choice to
 
04:20:01.149 --> 04:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
do that the the industry I work in is
 
04:20:03.950 --> 04:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
the jobs are are are rarely staff
 
04:20:06.109 --> 04:20:06.119 align:start position:0%
positions it's not necessarily a choice
 
04:20:08.990 --> 04:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
for most media workers um media workers
 
04:20:11.590 --> 04:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
are are usually only offered a contract
 
04:20:13.870 --> 04:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
and by staff position that would be a
 
04:20:16.870 --> 04:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
long-term salary over years um including
 
04:20:20.189 --> 04:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
health health insurance um retirement
 
04:20:23.550 --> 04:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
paid vacation sick leave um those are
 
04:20:26.790 --> 04:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
the quality categories um for a staff
 
04:20:29.189 --> 04:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
person but Freelancers or independent
 
04:20:31.349 --> 04:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
contractors are are rarely offered any
 
04:20:32.309 --> 04:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
of those
 
04:20:34.750 --> 04:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
benefits and and it's not necessarily a
 
04:20:38.349 --> 04:20:38.359 align:start position:0%
choice for most media workers
 
04:20:40.870 --> 04:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you further
 
04:20:44.429 --> 04:20:44.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:47.670 --> 04:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
stop thank you um as I look at this bill
 
04:20:49.550 --> 04:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
there's one section of it that says
 
04:20:51.389 --> 04:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
whenever a hiring party retains the
 
04:20:53.750 --> 04:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
services of a freelance worker the
 
04:20:56.469 --> 04:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
contract between the party and the free
 
04:20:58.950 --> 04:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
um Lance worker shall be reduced oh
 
04:21:00.790 --> 04:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
sorry shall be reduced to writing and
 
04:21:04.030 --> 04:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
the hiring party must furnish a copy of
 
04:21:07.510 --> 04:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
such written contract and um my question
 
04:21:10.950 --> 04:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
there is like if I'm hiring um a
 
04:21:13.349 --> 04:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
freelance photographer a freelance
 
04:21:15.910 --> 04:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
photographer to um take pictures of my
 
04:21:19.429 --> 04:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
daughter's wedding um typically in that
 
04:21:22.109 --> 04:21:22.119 align:start position:0%
situation doesn't the um doesn't the
 
04:21:23.910 --> 04:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
photographer provide the contract and
 
04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
all of that stuff would the would this
 
04:21:28.790 --> 04:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
bill um would this law make the burden
 
04:21:31.590 --> 04:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
of providing contracts for um someone
 
04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
who's going to um paint my house or um
 
04:21:38.830 --> 04:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
um or take photographs at a wedding
 
04:21:41.790 --> 04:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
would that put put the burden of
 
04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
creating the contract on the person
 
04:21:45.870 --> 04:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
doing the hiring and take it away from
 
04:21:49.070 --> 04:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
the person who's providing the
 
04:21:51.670 --> 04:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
service maybe this is a question for
 
04:21:51.680 --> 04:21:55.309 align:start position:0%
service maybe this is a question for
representative

04:21:55.309 --> 04:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:58.149 --> 04:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
grassy I'll be happy to get back up okay
 
04:22:00.750 --> 04:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I I can Envision either
 
04:22:03.109 --> 04:22:03.119 align:start position:0%
parties providing a contract and
 
04:22:05.349 --> 04:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
negotiating the terms of the
 
04:22:05.359 --> 04:22:07.950 align:start position:0%
negotiating the terms of the
contract

04:22:07.950 --> 04:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
contract
 
04:22:09.630 --> 04:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:22:12.349 --> 04:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
we'll when the questions are over I will
 
04:22:14.790 --> 04:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
ask you to come up and answer that I
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
would say I think this is the reason why
 
04:22:20.830 --> 04:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
the sponsor recommended that we um study
 
04:22:23.830 --> 04:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
this is It's a recognition that the
 
04:22:26.510 --> 04:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
language isn't there it's more
 
04:22:29.429 --> 04:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
conceptual at this point are there other
 
04:22:34.870 --> 04:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:38.429 --> 04:22:38.439 align:start position:0%
witness yeah we do we of time this a
 
04:22:43.429 --> 04:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:45.429 --> 04:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
question a little bit of unusual
 
04:22:50.030 --> 04:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
question but I wonder uh this is a uh a
 
04:22:51.710 --> 04:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
worker who we have not had a lot of
 
04:22:51.720 --> 04:22:52.670 align:start position:0%
worker who we have not had a lot of
exposure

04:22:52.670 --> 04:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
04:22:55.990 --> 04:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
to um as a committee and quite frankly
 
04:22:57.309 --> 04:22:57.319 align:start position:0%
the work that I've done over the years
 
04:22:59.870 --> 04:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
I've had as with the aflc didn't have a
 
04:23:03.389 --> 04:23:03.399 align:start position:0%
lot of Expos so it with with your
 
04:23:06.070 --> 04:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
permission if if you could uh kind of
 
04:23:09.109 --> 04:23:09.119 align:start position:0%
just describe what a typical week is for
 
04:23:12.990 --> 04:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
a for a u somebody like yourself as so
 
04:23:15.070 --> 04:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
that we have some orientation as to what
 
04:23:16.590 --> 04:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
that what it's like to be a fre
 
04:23:16.600 --> 04:23:18.229 align:start position:0%
that what it's like to be a fre
freelance

04:23:18.229 --> 04:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
freelance
 
04:23:21.510 --> 04:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
sure um I mean there's there's not quite
 
04:23:24.070 --> 04:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
a typical week because I do so many I
 
04:23:25.950 --> 04:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
wear so many different types of hats and
 
04:23:28.550 --> 04:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
I wear I do so many different types of
 
04:23:31.469 --> 04:23:31.479 align:start position:0%
jobs um over the last year I think I've
 
04:23:35.349 --> 04:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
had five or six contracts with um and
 
04:23:37.750 --> 04:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
they've varied from um I started the
 
04:23:40.870 --> 04:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
year working on a a documentary series
 
04:23:43.349 --> 04:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
that was um broadcast on Netflix and I
 
04:23:45.910 --> 04:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
was on a long-term contract for that
 
04:23:49.710 --> 04:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
position um and it ended in March um and
 
04:23:53.469 --> 04:23:53.479 align:start position:0%
following that I um I do contract work
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
um with the Department of State um under
 
04:23:58.510 --> 04:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
a diplomatic administrative program uh
 
04:24:01.309 --> 04:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
and I facilitate um foreign journalists
 
04:24:03.469 --> 04:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
who travel to the US to cover American
 
04:24:07.229 --> 04:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
policy so um when I wrapped my project
 
04:24:09.950 --> 04:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
working on a Netflix series I um was
 
04:24:12.590 --> 04:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
assigned a state department um reporting
 
04:24:16.830 --> 04:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
tour and I um coordinated interviews and
 
04:24:19.790 --> 04:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
travel for journalists from Indonesia um
 
04:24:23.189 --> 04:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
who are covering um the energy
 
04:24:26.790 --> 04:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
transition away from fossil fuels um so
 
04:24:29.950 --> 04:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
I um I also did that in conjunction with
 
04:24:32.229 --> 04:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit of archival research um
 
04:24:34.149 --> 04:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
which is what I do a lot of where I
 
04:24:37.510 --> 04:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
license media for documentaries um in
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
May I traveled with the journalists from
 
04:24:42.950 --> 04:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
Indonesia to Pittsburgh in Washington DC
 
04:24:44.590 --> 04:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
um and accompanied them on
 
04:24:48.389 --> 04:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
interviews um and then I was uh
 
04:24:51.349 --> 04:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
contacted to do more archival research
 
04:24:54.670 --> 04:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
for um a documentary about Afghan um
 
04:24:57.309 --> 04:24:57.319 align:start position:0%
women soccer team who uh escaped the
 
04:25:01.229 --> 04:25:01.239 align:start position:0%
Taliban and so in July I devoted my time
 
04:25:03.870 --> 04:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
to doing research for that documentary
 
04:25:06.670 --> 04:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
so every job I have is different um and
 
04:25:08.269 --> 04:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
every day is different if I'm not
 
04:25:11.149 --> 04:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
working I'm actively looking for
 
04:25:13.630 --> 04:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
work that was my my other question
 
04:25:15.309 --> 04:25:15.319 align:start position:0%
relative to how you get your how you get
 
04:25:17.189 --> 04:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
your work so you're you're out there
 
04:25:19.149 --> 04:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
looking all the time I'm looking and
 
04:25:21.429 --> 04:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
most of my work I've gotten the best
 
04:25:23.030 --> 04:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities because I've been working
 
04:25:25.750 --> 04:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the industry for 20 years and I um
 
04:25:28.990 --> 04:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
get my work through my network um but it
 
04:25:30.950 --> 04:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's taken me 20 years to kind of
 
04:25:33.670 --> 04:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:36.590 --> 04:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
network representative Cen
 
04:25:36.600 --> 04:25:39.109 align:start position:0%
network representative Cen
thank

04:25:39.109 --> 04:25:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:39.119 --> 04:25:40.750 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:25:40.750 --> 04:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:25:44.070 --> 04:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
so so when you are going out looking for
 
04:25:47.229 --> 04:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
work um are you the one who seeking the
 
04:25:49.030 --> 04:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
work selling yourself and presenting
 
04:25:50.870 --> 04:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
your contract and your proposal for what
 
04:25:53.070 --> 04:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
you're willing to do or are you working
 
04:25:55.510 --> 04:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
more in an environment where you are
 
04:25:57.950 --> 04:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
reacting and responding to somebody
 
04:25:59.750 --> 04:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
else's terms and conditions and putting
 
04:26:01.830 --> 04:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
your price on that and then competing
 
04:26:04.269 --> 04:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
against Market other Freelancers so are
 
04:26:06.229 --> 04:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
you really more responding to what we
 
04:26:08.550 --> 04:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
would call a a request for proposal or
 
04:26:10.269 --> 04:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
are you putting your contract and your
 
04:26:12.149 --> 04:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
terms out there and selling yourself and
 
04:26:15.710 --> 04:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
your skills um it's a little bit of both
 
04:26:19.349 --> 04:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
um I um I don't necessarily respond to
 
04:26:21.630 --> 04:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
requests for proposals but I I'm
 
04:26:24.429 --> 04:26:24.439 align:start position:0%
responding for job openings with um
 
04:26:26.429 --> 04:26:26.439 align:start position:0%
short-term contracts for documentary
 
04:26:29.189 --> 04:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
films for instance um I do a lot of
 
04:26:31.950 --> 04:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
networking um I do a lot of Outreach so
 
04:26:34.990 --> 04:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
I would say it's a combination of the
 
04:26:35.000 --> 04:26:36.590 align:start position:0%
I would say it's a combination of the
two

04:26:36.590 --> 04:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:26:38.950 --> 04:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
so when you're when you're responding to
 
04:26:41.389 --> 04:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
these jobs that are available and open
 
04:26:44.429 --> 04:26:44.439 align:start position:0%
are you are they setting the price that
 
04:26:46.429 --> 04:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
they already want to pay so you know
 
04:26:47.950 --> 04:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
that going in that this is what they're
 
04:26:50.269 --> 04:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
willing to pay yes and I ask for more
 
04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
because I think I I recognize my value
 
04:26:54.630 --> 04:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
and my experience in the workplace so I
 
04:26:57.710 --> 04:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
can ask for more but that they don't you
 
04:26:59.349 --> 04:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
know there's a certain expectation of
 
04:27:01.830 --> 04:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
what these skills are paying so you
 
04:27:03.389 --> 04:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
still have the free option of saying
 
04:27:04.750 --> 04:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
okay I can't work for that money and
 
04:27:06.429 --> 04:27:06.439 align:start position:0%
walking away from it
 
04:27:09.149 --> 04:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
and maybe pushing the envelope making
 
04:27:11.109 --> 04:27:11.119 align:start position:0%
them to make the decision to pay higher
 
04:27:12.750 --> 04:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to Loser so we're
 
04:27:14.269 --> 04:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
willing to pay higher by you walking
 
04:27:16.109 --> 04:27:16.119 align:start position:0%
away I could it's it's a very
 
04:27:20.590 --> 04:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
competitive field and so by saying I'm I
 
04:27:22.349 --> 04:27:22.359 align:start position:0%
um this is my rate then I might walk
 
04:27:25.109 --> 04:27:25.119 align:start position:0%
away and not have work for a few months
 
04:27:27.750 --> 04:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
so it's it's just a bit precarious to
 
04:27:29.990 --> 04:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
turn down
 
04:27:33.429 --> 04:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
work thank you any further questions
 
04:27:33.439 --> 04:27:34.910 align:start position:0%
work thank you any further questions

04:27:37.469 --> 04:27:37.479 align:start position:0%
McKenzie
 
04:27:41.309 --> 04:27:41.319 align:start position:0%
just trying to get a sense of how many
 
04:27:45.750 --> 04:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
people I need a help uh how many people
 
04:27:48.229 --> 04:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
do you do you get I have a sense that
 
04:27:51.550 --> 04:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
are in the same kind of position uh uh
 
04:27:54.510 --> 04:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
in if you have any sense of that at all
 
04:27:57.910 --> 04:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a good question um I I've
 
04:27:59.950 --> 04:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
been trying to get data that's one of
 
04:28:02.550 --> 04:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
the things um this hearing happened
 
04:28:04.750 --> 04:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
quite quickly in my opinion and I would
 
04:28:07.990 --> 04:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
have wanted to get a lot more data um
 
04:28:09.269 --> 04:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
about the number of people in New
 
04:28:11.389 --> 04:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I did I have seen numbers
 
04:28:14.229 --> 04:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
that 12.4% of the workforce in New
 
04:28:16.030 --> 04:28:16.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is self-employed and that
 
04:28:18.870 --> 04:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
might be under reported um I suspect
 
04:28:22.309 --> 04:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of self-employed um people
 
04:28:24.189 --> 04:28:24.199 align:start position:0%
who work under these conditions in in
 
04:28:24.199 --> 04:28:26.149 align:start position:0%
who work under these conditions in in
New

04:28:26.149 --> 04:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:28:30.910 --> 04:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
sylvestra thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:28:34.630 --> 04:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm still
 
04:28:36.070 --> 04:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
trying to Grapple with everything you've
 
04:28:39.790 --> 04:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
said um and correct me if I'm wrong
 
04:28:41.510 --> 04:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately what you're looking for is
 
04:28:44.389 --> 04:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
when there is a contract you want the
 
04:28:47.710 --> 04:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
possible employer to have some sort of
 
04:28:52.070 --> 04:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
benefits in there for you that would
 
04:28:56.109 --> 04:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
what have some health benefits or or or
 
04:28:59.189 --> 04:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
injury protection or whatever it may be
 
04:29:02.189 --> 04:29:02.199 align:start position:0%
that's the that's your ultimate goal
 
04:29:04.149 --> 04:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
legislatively for us to do that I think
 
04:29:08.070 --> 04:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
legislatively for we're we this bill is
 
04:29:10.630 --> 04:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
interested in in having a contract I I
 
04:29:14.389 --> 04:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
don't um imagine that health benefits
 
04:29:16.309 --> 04:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
will be guaranteed in the contract I
 
04:29:18.269 --> 04:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
don't know that that would happen but I
 
04:29:21.469 --> 04:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
think we we really insist on having an
 
04:29:24.309 --> 04:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
apparatus to guarantee payments on time
 
04:29:26.550 --> 04:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
and having a negotiable contract having
 
04:29:28.750 --> 04:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
a contract um that we're able to
 
04:29:32.229 --> 04:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
negotiate that that we don't um that has
 
04:29:34.630 --> 04:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
terms I I've had contracts that required
 
04:29:36.910 --> 04:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
me to work 12h hour days I've had
 
04:29:38.510 --> 04:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
contracts that have required me to work
 
04:29:41.950 --> 04:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
six days a week um I often have very
 
04:29:44.030 --> 04:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
erratic schedules at the last minute I
 
04:29:46.389 --> 04:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
easily work 70 hours a week many many
 
04:29:49.030 --> 04:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
weeks of my career um so we're hoping
 
04:29:51.070 --> 04:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
just to have more kind of Labor
 
04:29:53.950 --> 04:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
Protections in a contract um and so we
 
04:29:56.269 --> 04:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
want to negotiate the contract and and
 
04:29:58.790 --> 04:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
make sure um self-employed people are
 
04:30:00.870 --> 04:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
getting paid on time I haven't had much
 
04:30:03.990 --> 04:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
experience with non um payment but many
 
04:30:06.389 --> 04:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
many journalists I mean I'm I'm involved
 
04:30:08.469 --> 04:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
in many journalism groups and there's
 
04:30:10.070 --> 04:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
many media professionals and many
 
04:30:12.510 --> 04:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
journalists who don't get paid on time
 
04:30:14.790 --> 04:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
and they don't have an apparatus to um
 
04:30:16.950 --> 04:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
enforce being paid in 30 days it takes a
 
04:30:20.590 --> 04:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
lot of time um to kind of track down
 
04:30:22.590 --> 04:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
payments um when they're trying to do
 
04:30:27.269 --> 04:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.910 --> 04:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
week any further
 
04:30:31.950 --> 04:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
04:30:33.590 --> 04:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you so much I really
 
04:30:36.030 --> 04:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time and we did have a
 
04:30:37.870 --> 04:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
question for representative grassy if
 
04:30:46.389 --> 04:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:49.070 --> 04:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
that um yeah I I think that's one of the
 
04:30:51.030 --> 04:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
things I think the chairman addressed it
 
04:30:53.229 --> 04:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
correctly is that we like this to go to
 
04:30:54.990 --> 04:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
interim study so that we can get things
 
04:30:56.950 --> 04:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
like maybe a one-day contract short-term
 
04:30:59.710 --> 04:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
contracts are exempt uh and certainly
 
04:31:02.189 --> 04:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
whether that contract is provided by the
 
04:31:04.109 --> 04:31:04.119 align:start position:0%
uh the photographer uh it would be
 
04:31:05.670 --> 04:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
something that would be you would be the
 
04:31:06.910 --> 04:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
person that would be offering the
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
contract you just happen to be offering
 
04:31:11.149 --> 04:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
his contract uh and he would sign it but
 
04:31:12.429 --> 04:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
you would be the person who would be the
 
04:31:14.309 --> 04:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
controlling entity as far as that that
 
04:31:16.349 --> 04:31:16.359 align:start position:0%
contractor concerned it would lay out
 
04:31:18.870 --> 04:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
what is specifically required of of him
 
04:31:21.830 --> 04:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
to do uh usually uh when you when you do
 
04:31:23.149 --> 04:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
that you you know the Contra the
 
04:31:24.790 --> 04:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
photographer will say this is what I
 
04:31:26.750 --> 04:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
will do and this is what you will pay
 
04:31:27.670 --> 04:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
and these are what the payment
 
04:31:29.349 --> 04:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
requirements are and I think that's what
 
04:31:31.710 --> 04:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
this is looking for is it not only for
 
04:31:33.229 --> 04:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
one-day contracts or short-term
 
04:31:35.030 --> 04:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
contracts which could be Exempted from
 
04:31:36.510 --> 04:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
this that people who are doing these
 
04:31:37.910 --> 04:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
contracts would like to have some
 
04:31:39.870 --> 04:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
protection within their contracts so
 
04:31:41.149 --> 04:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
that they know when they walk into
 
04:31:42.990 --> 04:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
things things aren't going to be changed
 
04:31:44.189 --> 04:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
I've been meeting with these group with
 
04:31:47.670 --> 04:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
a group of these people on on on Zoom uh
 
04:31:49.590 --> 04:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
and most of these folks are out doing
 
04:31:51.590 --> 04:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
their job not just here in New Hampshire
 
04:31:52.670 --> 04:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
but all across the country and all
 
04:31:54.429 --> 04:31:54.439 align:start position:0%
across the world I've had about a half a
 
04:31:55.510 --> 04:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
dozen of them that we' sat down
 
04:31:57.269 --> 04:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
regularly and talk to this because I was
 
04:31:58.670 --> 04:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
trying to get my head around this thing
 
04:32:00.429 --> 04:32:00.439 align:start position:0%
as well to say what are you looking for
 
04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
what do we what do we want to do and
 
04:32:03.790 --> 04:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
they're saying we'd like to have basic
 
04:32:05.550 --> 04:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
requirements in our contracts we' like
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
have basic promises on contracts that
 
04:32:09.429 --> 04:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
things don't change one of the things
 
04:32:11.309 --> 04:32:11.319 align:start position:0%
that Sarah told me she says I'm out here
 
04:32:13.229 --> 04:32:13.239 align:start position:0%
I'm working 60 hours and all of a sudden
 
04:32:14.389 --> 04:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
you know and then that's what my
 
04:32:16.189 --> 04:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
contract says that I could work 60 hours
 
04:32:18.109 --> 04:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
a week and all of a sudden the contract
 
04:32:21.149 --> 04:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
the person who hired me said I want more
 
04:32:22.750 --> 04:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
I want you to change I want you to do
 
04:32:24.309 --> 04:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
this now and I'm not going to offer you
 
04:32:26.710 --> 04:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
any more money for it and so it was
 
04:32:28.670 --> 04:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
basically you know if you don't like it
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'll let you out of your contract have a
 
04:32:31.550 --> 04:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
good day by don't expect to get rest of
 
04:32:34.389 --> 04:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
your pay and so she's sort of stuck she
 
04:32:36.790 --> 04:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
gets into a contract they make a change
 
04:32:39.790 --> 04:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
and then they want you to do it without
 
04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
any more pay or without um you know and
 
04:32:44.229 --> 04:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
if you don't like it have a good day by
 
04:32:45.790 --> 04:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
I'll scrap everything you did I won't
 
04:32:46.950 --> 04:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
pay you and I'll bring somebody in to
 
04:32:49.030 --> 04:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
finish the job that's you know these
 
04:32:51.109 --> 04:32:51.119 align:start position:0%
people would like some protections and
 
04:32:53.030 --> 04:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
as you said this is something you don't
 
04:32:54.510 --> 04:32:54.520 align:start position:0%
normally see here because it's not you
 
04:32:56.830 --> 04:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
don't think of these people as employees
 
04:32:58.429 --> 04:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
but they are and they are our residents
 
04:33:00.070 --> 04:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
04:33:01.950 --> 04:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'll be happy to answer
 
04:33:01.960 --> 04:33:02.830 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'll be happy to answer
any

04:33:02.830 --> 04:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:33:04.910 --> 04:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
questions uh we have another question
 
04:33:07.510 --> 04:33:07.520 align:start position:0%

04:33:10.230 --> 04:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
being here you just mentioned that their
 
04:33:12.629 --> 04:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
employees um freelance workers that are
 
04:33:15.949 --> 04:33:15.959 align:start position:0%
under contract are contracted employees
 
04:33:17.869 --> 04:33:17.879 align:start position:0%
they are not not an actual employee on
 
04:33:19.949 --> 04:33:19.959 align:start position:0%
staff well they're workers maybe that's
 
04:33:21.429 --> 04:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
a term I should use they're workers here
 
04:33:22.990 --> 04:33:23.000 align:start position:0%

clarify some of these
 
04:33:39.470 --> 04:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh distinctions for us in the current
 
04:34:04.269 --> 04:34:04.279 align:start position:0%

have spoken with uh representative

grassy and we've discussed the idea of
 
04:35:05.470 --> 04:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
the interim study the department of
 
04:35:07.910 --> 04:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
Labor is more than willing to work with
 
04:35:11.429 --> 04:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
representative grassy and see if there's
 
04:35:14.429 --> 04:35:14.439 align:start position:0%
something that we can help him with this
 
04:35:16.709 --> 04:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
over the summer or whatever the the
 
04:35:19.869 --> 04:35:19.879 align:start position:0%
session is um and we'd be more than

happy to contribute to the um whatever
 
04:35:27.070 --> 04:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
he wants to try to turn this bill into
 
04:35:28.429 --> 04:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
because he's already admitted that
 
04:35:31.150 --> 04:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
there's some language issues and some
 
04:35:33.269 --> 04:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
questions that are coming out
 
04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
obviously um
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
one of the first concerns that the
 
04:35:40.189 --> 04:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
department had looking at this bill and
 
04:35:42.349 --> 04:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
we would have to flush that out is the
 
04:35:45.910 --> 04:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
actual definition of a freelance worker
 
04:35:47.670 --> 04:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
um what we have here if you look at the
 
04:35:51.310 --> 04:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
bill under Section Roman
 
04:35:54.910 --> 04:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
4 it says that freelance worker in
 
04:35:57.750 --> 04:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
quotation marks it means a natural
 
04:36:00.830 --> 04:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
person or organization composed of no
 
04:36:03.590 --> 04:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
more than one natural person whether or
 
04:36:06.029 --> 04:36:06.039 align:start position:0%
not incorporated or employing a trade
 
04:36:08.949 --> 04:36:08.959 align:start position:0%
name that is hired or retained as an
 
04:36:11.551 --> 04:36:11.561 align:start position:0%
independent contractor this definitely
 
04:36:13.551 --> 04:36:13.561 align:start position:0%
needs to be cleaned up because basically
 
04:36:16.029 --> 04:36:16.039 align:start position:0%
what this is saying or the way I look at
 
04:36:17.310 --> 04:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
this and interpret this is that a
 
04:36:19.789 --> 04:36:19.799 align:start position:0%
freelance worker is an independent
 
04:36:22.789 --> 04:36:22.799 align:start position:0%
contractor an independent contractor has
 
04:36:25.470 --> 04:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
the freedom to negotiate their contracts
 
04:36:27.109 --> 04:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
they factor in what their overheads
 
04:36:29.830 --> 04:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
going to be what their inclusive of
 
04:36:31.269 --> 04:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
payment of any of the employees that
 
04:36:32.869 --> 04:36:32.879 align:start position:0%
they have working for them but in this
 
04:36:34.349 --> 04:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
particular case it's one person so it
 
04:36:37.310 --> 04:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
would be inclusive of equipment cost for
 
04:36:39.109 --> 04:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
any type of benefits that they may want
 
04:36:42.189 --> 04:36:42.199 align:start position:0%
for themselves and obviously you're not
 
04:36:44.150 --> 04:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
going to you know have an acrel a
 
04:36:46.029 --> 04:36:46.039 align:start position:0%
vacation time or sick time but at least
 
04:36:48.150 --> 04:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
be able to have sufficient funds set
 
04:36:51.269 --> 04:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
aside so that you can take that time for
 
04:36:54.349 --> 04:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
yourself these are all able to be
 
04:36:57.189 --> 04:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
negotiated into a
 
04:37:00.109 --> 04:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
contract such as for an independent
 
04:37:02.590 --> 04:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
contractor the same thing would be for a
 
04:37:05.029 --> 04:37:05.039 align:start position:0%
subcontractor you negotiate all of that
 
04:37:08.830 --> 04:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
information in as far as protections
 
04:37:11.150 --> 04:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
04:37:16.189 --> 04:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
payment the it's a contract and the way
 
04:37:18.629 --> 04:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
to protect in a contract and it it can
 
04:37:20.590 --> 04:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
be laborious and it can be timec
 
04:37:23.189 --> 04:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
consuming is through the Superior Court
 
04:37:24.990 --> 04:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
in an employment law action or a
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
contractual action and also keeping in
 
04:37:30.869 --> 04:37:30.879 align:start position:0%
mind that superior court allows for
 
04:37:34.109 --> 04:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
payment of attorney's fees uh if the
 
04:37:37.109 --> 04:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
plaintiff is a provent failing party so
 
04:37:40.310 --> 04:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
there is a resource for that the problem
 
04:37:42.670 --> 04:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
that we also understand which is why
 
04:37:44.949 --> 04:37:44.959 align:start position:0%
we're also willing to work with u
 
04:37:46.670 --> 04:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
representative grassy on this to see
 
04:37:49.269 --> 04:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
what we can all come up with is we also
 
04:37:51.670 --> 04:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
understand that it can take a long time
 
04:37:54.269 --> 04:37:54.279 align:start position:0%
to get through that superior court
 
04:37:56.949 --> 04:37:56.959 align:start position:0%
process um there was a point in time
 
04:38:01.910 --> 04:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
even long before the pandemic hid when
 
04:38:04.349 --> 04:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
it could take anywhere from 3 to 6 years
 
04:38:06.830 --> 04:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
to get a joury trial that doesn't
 
04:38:08.230 --> 04:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that that's what would
 
04:38:10.709 --> 04:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
happen here that's the worst case
 
04:38:14.029 --> 04:38:14.039 align:start position:0%
scenario um but I can see where that's a
 
04:38:15.709 --> 04:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
concern when you're trying to chase your
 
04:38:17.910 --> 04:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
money but the bottom line is is you're
 
04:38:21.029 --> 04:38:21.039 align:start position:0%
chasing payment on a contract so there
 
04:38:24.470 --> 04:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be more definitive language in
 
04:38:26.869 --> 04:38:26.879 align:start position:0%
this to figure out a way to delineate
 
04:38:29.551 --> 04:38:29.561 align:start position:0%
the difference if the Department of
 
04:38:32.670 --> 04:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
Labor is going to be able to understand
 
04:38:35.470 --> 04:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
how to interpret what the expectations
 
04:38:37.709 --> 04:38:37.719 align:start position:0%
are what the wants and the needs are of
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
the freelance worker
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
community and figure out whether or not
 
04:38:43.990 --> 04:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
actually the department of labor would
 
04:38:46.230 --> 04:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
enforce a freelance contract if it turns
 
04:38:51.910 --> 04:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
out that a freelance worker is truly
 
04:38:55.390 --> 04:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
defined as an independent contractor so
 
04:38:58.551 --> 04:38:58.561 align:start position:0%
under 281a which is the workers
 
04:39:01.070 --> 04:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
compensation act an independent
 
04:39:04.189 --> 04:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
contractor has there their definitions
 
04:39:05.429 --> 04:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
first of all under
 
04:39:08.269 --> 04:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
281a the presumption is that the
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
person's an employee unless the employer
 
04:39:13.150 --> 04:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
rebuts the presumption to show that
 
04:39:15.750 --> 04:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
they're an independent contractor
 
04:39:20.789 --> 04:39:20.799 align:start position:0%
and they everything that miss Cat's very
 
04:39:23.830 --> 04:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh skillfully described as to what type
 
04:39:27.230 --> 04:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
of work she does what she's looking for
 
04:39:29.869 --> 04:39:29.879 align:start position:0%
it fits under what an independent
 
04:39:32.470 --> 04:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
contractor would be defined as
 
04:39:35.510 --> 04:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
underneath um
 
04:39:39.150 --> 04:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
281a and again I say as I always say it
 
04:39:41.030 --> 04:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
always will depend upon the facts
 
04:39:42.830 --> 04:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
presented and the evidence presented as
 
04:39:44.070 --> 04:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
to whether or not someone would be
 
04:39:46.310 --> 04:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
determined as such but I don't believe
 
04:39:48.628 --> 04:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
Miss Catz and representative grassy are
 
04:39:50.510 --> 04:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
here trying to say that a freelance
 
04:39:52.390 --> 04:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
worker is an employee so I don't think
 
04:39:54.628 --> 04:39:54.638 align:start position:0%
the issue would ever come to pass but
 
04:39:56.230 --> 04:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
for a definition you can look at an
 
04:39:59.830 --> 04:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
independent contractor in 281 A2 which
 
04:40:01.430 --> 04:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
is the list of
 
04:40:05.190 --> 04:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
definitions looking underneath the um
 
04:40:08.150 --> 04:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
employment protections under the 275s I
 
04:40:10.670 --> 04:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:13.708 --> 04:40:13.718 align:start position:0%
27546 and maybe I get a spitball in the
 
04:40:15.750 --> 04:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
back of the head if I got the name wrong
 
04:40:18.830 --> 04:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
um where it talks about um independent
 
04:40:21.750 --> 04:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
contractors and those definitions and
 
04:40:24.110 --> 04:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
who pays for What on certain types of
 
04:40:26.030 --> 04:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
issues and there may be another statute
 
04:40:27.550 --> 04:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
that actually gives definitions but the
 
04:40:29.628 --> 04:40:29.638 align:start position:0%
presumption under that is that they are
 
04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
independent contractors unless the
 
04:40:34.190 --> 04:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
person proves that they're actually an
 
04:40:34.200 --> 04:40:35.470 align:start position:0%
person proves that they're actually an
employee

04:40:35.470 --> 04:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
employee
 
04:40:39.150 --> 04:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
so we need to find out what exactly this
 
04:40:41.990 --> 04:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
would be defined underdefined as because
 
04:40:44.550 --> 04:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
if we leave it as independent
 
04:40:47.190 --> 04:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
contractor then the negotiation of the
 
04:40:50.470 --> 04:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
contract as much sympathy as I can
 
04:40:53.868 --> 04:40:53.878 align:start position:0%
understand especially in in a in a field
 
04:40:56.868 --> 04:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
where maybe higher paid parties have
 
04:40:59.948 --> 04:40:59.958 align:start position:0%
more negotiating power uh than the
 
04:40:59.958 --> 04:41:01.070 align:start position:0%
more negotiating power uh than the
freelance

04:41:01.070 --> 04:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
freelance
 
04:41:05.310 --> 04:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
workers it's still a contract and
 
04:41:08.390 --> 04:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
um it would be nice to have a way to
 
04:41:11.390 --> 04:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
negotiate a contract better to work them
 
04:41:11.400 --> 04:41:13.430 align:start position:0%
negotiate a contract better to work them
together

04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:41:16.470 --> 04:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
but we need some more work on this and
 
04:41:17.550 --> 04:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
and like I said we'd be more than
 
04:41:20.110 --> 04:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
willing to work with representative
 
04:41:22.590 --> 04:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
grassy thank you for that explanation
 
04:41:25.190 --> 04:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's very good
 
04:41:27.830 --> 04:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
um something that comes to mind I know
 
04:41:30.190 --> 04:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
we've spent a lot of time on these
 
04:41:32.270 --> 04:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
different definitions of independent
 
04:41:34.628 --> 04:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
contractor many on this committee are
 
04:41:37.190 --> 04:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
are concerned with the issue of
 
04:41:41.150 --> 04:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
misclassification and uh a lot of times
 
04:41:44.628 --> 04:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
the focus seems to be that this was
 
04:41:46.910 --> 04:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
presented as an independent contractor
 
04:41:50.190 --> 04:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
case but it's really an employee and
 
04:41:52.070 --> 04:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
when that
 
04:41:54.590 --> 04:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
happens it's not a matter of negotiating
 
04:41:56.510 --> 04:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
the contract that person becomes an
 
04:42:00.590 --> 04:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
employee and and pay back payment of
 
04:42:04.670 --> 04:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
workers comp will be due um maybe some
 
04:42:07.550 --> 04:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
some benefits that were guaranteed where
 
04:42:09.510 --> 04:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going with this
 
04:42:13.110 --> 04:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
is wouldn't you see a concern with
 
04:42:17.310 --> 04:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
defining a new class of independent
 
04:42:20.350 --> 04:42:20.360 align:start position:0%
contractor or maybe not class but a a
 
04:42:23.190 --> 04:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
new set of regulations on independent
 
04:42:27.470 --> 04:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
contractor would interfere in ways with
 
04:42:30.830 --> 04:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
that structure that has to deal with
 
04:42:32.590 --> 04:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
workers comp and
 
04:42:35.708 --> 04:42:35.718 align:start position:0%
misclassification and create a problem
 
04:42:37.350 --> 04:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
the actual concern that actually comes
 
04:42:39.590 --> 04:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
out to me is we're still calling it an
 
04:42:41.230 --> 04:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
independent contractor and we already
 
04:42:43.270 --> 04:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
have the laws set for that the
 
04:42:45.910 --> 04:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor doesn't step in for
 
04:42:47.510 --> 04:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
an independent
 
04:42:50.350 --> 04:42:50.360 align:start position:0%
contractor um there is no payment of
 
04:42:53.590 --> 04:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
wages issue for an a a single person
 
04:42:55.788 --> 04:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
independent contractor the only wage
 
04:42:58.070 --> 04:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
issue that comes into play with an
 
04:42:59.430 --> 04:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
independent contractor or a
 
04:43:01.590 --> 04:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
subcontractor is when your
 
04:43:03.990 --> 04:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
subcontractor does not have workers comp
 
04:43:04.000 --> 04:43:05.310 align:start position:0%
subcontractor does not have workers comp
coverage

04:43:05.310 --> 04:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
04:43:07.390 --> 04:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
and one of the subcontractor employees
 
04:43:11.590 --> 04:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
gets injured that goes up to section 18
 
04:43:13.110 --> 04:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
which requires the independent
 
04:43:15.070 --> 04:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
contractor or the general contractor to
 
04:43:16.750 --> 04:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
pay and they of course can get
 
04:43:18.910 --> 04:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement going back for
 
04:43:21.948 --> 04:43:21.958 align:start position:0%
subreg but other than that we don't deal
 
04:43:25.310 --> 04:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
with independent contractors
 
04:43:28.708 --> 04:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
contracts um if an issue did pop up with
 
04:43:30.628 --> 04:43:30.638 align:start position:0%
respect to determining whether or not
 
04:43:32.550 --> 04:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
they really were an employee versus an
 
04:43:33.948 --> 04:43:33.958 align:start position:0%
independent contractor then we go
 
04:43:35.310 --> 04:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
underneath the the statute and we look
 
04:43:37.990 --> 04:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
and see okay this is this is what you
 
04:43:40.390 --> 04:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
have to show us to determine whether or
 
04:43:43.350 --> 04:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
not you're an independent or you're an
 
04:43:46.270 --> 04:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
employee adding freelance as an
 
04:43:48.030 --> 04:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
independent contractor I'm not sure that
 
04:43:50.270 --> 04:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
it would really change anything because
 
04:43:52.510 --> 04:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
it's still an independent contractor
 
04:43:55.190 --> 04:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
unless we figure out something in an
 
04:43:57.430 --> 04:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
interim study and work with um
 
04:43:59.628 --> 04:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
representative grassy to figure out some
 
04:44:03.390 --> 04:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
kind of way to look at this
 
04:44:05.868 --> 04:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
differently other questions for the
 
04:44:08.070 --> 04:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
Department representative
 
04:44:11.470 --> 04:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
Copan thank you I guess I'm I'm
 
04:44:12.990 --> 04:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
wondering based off of some of the
 
04:44:15.150 --> 04:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
testimony that I heard prior to you is
 
04:44:18.110 --> 04:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
um this is an almost an education piece
 
04:44:19.868 --> 04:44:19.878 align:start position:0%
going back to the conversation here
 
04:44:21.350 --> 04:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
regarding the definition of an
 
04:44:21.360 --> 04:44:22.788 align:start position:0%
regarding the definition of an
independent

04:44:22.788 --> 04:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
independent
 
04:44:24.910 --> 04:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
contractor correct me if I'm wrong on
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
this but my understanding is that one of
 
04:44:29.430 --> 04:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
the criteria to be an independent
 
04:44:32.030 --> 04:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
contractor is that you have control over
 
04:44:34.070 --> 04:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
your hours worked and that the employer
 
04:44:36.230 --> 04:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
can not or the the company you're
 
04:44:38.510 --> 04:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
working for cannot mandate how many
 
04:44:40.708 --> 04:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
hours a day you work or what hours per
 
04:44:43.030 --> 04:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
day you work that they give you the
 
04:44:46.030 --> 04:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
project that needs to be done and you
 
04:44:48.628 --> 04:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
get it done without the oversight and
 
04:44:51.190 --> 04:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
the tight management of of the the
 
04:44:52.830 --> 04:44:52.840 align:start position:0%
business that you're working
 
04:44:55.350 --> 04:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
for on the surface that's that's
 
04:44:58.670 --> 04:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
accurate but you can also contract in
 
04:45:01.868 --> 04:45:01.878 align:start position:0%
that the independent contractor does not
 
04:45:03.990 --> 04:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
work during certain hours because of
 
04:45:06.190 --> 04:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
either Darkness or temperature or
 
04:45:07.948 --> 04:45:07.958 align:start position:0%
there's nobody else on the job site and
 
04:45:10.430 --> 04:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
then there's needs to be supervision you
 
04:45:12.910 --> 04:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
can put into the contract that an
 
04:45:14.550 --> 04:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
independent contractor actually needs to
 
04:45:17.868 --> 04:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
work between specific hours they're able
 
04:45:20.070 --> 04:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
to an independent contractor it brings
 
04:45:22.628 --> 04:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
their own tools their independent
 
04:45:25.830 --> 04:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
contractor holds thems out as their own
 
04:45:28.470 --> 04:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
business a lot of times an independent
 
04:45:30.030 --> 04:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
contractor will use their own social
 
04:45:32.470 --> 04:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
security number instead of getting an F
 
04:45:34.350 --> 04:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
uh Federal employer identification
 
04:45:36.510 --> 04:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
number of their own but they hold
 
04:45:38.270 --> 04:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
themselves out as being completely
 
04:45:39.948 --> 04:45:39.958 align:start position:0%
separate from any type of employment
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
with that general contractor or the
 
04:45:42.240 --> 04:45:43.190 align:start position:0%
with that general contractor or the
hiring

04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
04:45:46.708 --> 04:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
party um they can work for other people
 
04:45:50.230 --> 04:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
at the same time without any uh
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
possibility of being told you can't do
 
04:45:55.030 --> 04:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
that but there can be some limitations
 
04:45:57.628 --> 04:45:57.638 align:start position:0%
that are drafted into the contract
 
04:46:00.190 --> 04:46:00.200 align:start position:0%
between the independent contractor and
 
04:46:03.190 --> 04:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
the hiring party that does give some
 
04:46:03.200 --> 04:46:05.550 align:start position:0%
the hiring party that does give some
specifications

04:46:05.550 --> 04:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
specifications
 
04:46:07.868 --> 04:46:07.878 align:start position:0%
if you don't like them you don't agree
 
04:46:09.830 --> 04:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
to them or you renegotiate that's really
 
04:46:11.670 --> 04:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
what it comes down to but some things do
 
04:46:14.350 --> 04:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
need to have some kind of specification
 
04:46:14.360 --> 04:46:17.948 align:start position:0%
need to have some kind of specification
to

04:46:17.948 --> 04:46:17.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:22.270 --> 04:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
them representative Balon thank you um
 
04:46:24.510 --> 04:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
04:46:27.430 --> 04:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
mcar again um so you're saying that the
 
04:46:29.548 --> 04:46:29.558 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor should have
 
04:46:31.190 --> 04:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over independent
 
04:46:33.070 --> 04:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
contractors's contracts and have
 
04:46:35.310 --> 04:46:35.320 align:start position:0%
stipulations of no contract shouldn't
 
04:46:39.948 --> 04:46:39.958 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say no okay no thank you no
 
04:46:43.670 --> 04:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
you can shut your microphone off now
 
04:46:46.150 --> 04:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
no you're not
 
04:46:48.670 --> 04:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
recognized other questions for the
 
04:46:51.750 --> 04:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
Department representative
 
04:46:54.230 --> 04:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
svin perhaps more of a suggestion than a
 
04:46:56.430 --> 04:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
question um we're talking about an
 
04:46:59.070 --> 04:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
interim study U which essentially stays
 
04:47:01.548 --> 04:47:01.558 align:start position:0%
within this committee um you the study
 
04:47:04.150 --> 04:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
is done by this committee um and
 
04:47:07.708 --> 04:47:07.718 align:start position:0%
wondering if a more useful tool would be
 
04:47:11.948 --> 04:47:11.958 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc committee um you know which
 
04:47:13.990 --> 04:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative grassy since this is an
 
04:47:17.110 --> 04:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
issue that you've bonded with um you
 
04:47:18.750 --> 04:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
could figure out who you want to work
 
04:47:20.708 --> 04:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
with on it and it could be people from
 
04:47:22.470 --> 04:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
multiple committees people from this
 
04:47:25.190 --> 04:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
committee um and uh whoever else from
 
04:47:27.110 --> 04:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
the outside that you're interested in it
 
04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
might be more you might get more mileage
 
04:47:32.868 --> 04:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
out of that than um actually having us
 
04:47:38.750 --> 04:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
form um in interim um uh uh interim
 
04:47:42.470 --> 04:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
study um committee because we all know
 
04:47:44.310 --> 04:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
that interim study committees frequently
 
04:47:48.230 --> 04:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:51.670 --> 04:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
nothing thank you and I will agree with
 
04:47:54.510 --> 04:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
the representative that in some cases an
 
04:47:58.110 --> 04:47:58.120 align:start position:0%
interim study works well with
 
04:48:01.910 --> 04:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
a concept that's close but needs needs
 
04:48:05.350 --> 04:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
some details on it when things are wide
 
04:48:08.548 --> 04:48:08.558 align:start position:0%
open like this I my experience is it's
 
04:48:11.628 --> 04:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
often better to work on the bill
 
04:48:14.190 --> 04:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
proposal outside of the committee
 
04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
process get something that's a lot
 
04:48:20.350 --> 04:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
closer and then that gives us something
 
04:48:22.310 --> 04:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
that won't just get brushed off go to
 
04:48:24.190 --> 04:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
interm study and then oh we didn't get a
 
04:48:26.030 --> 04:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
chance to meet uh we'll write a little
 
04:48:30.750 --> 04:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
report so thank you that that is a good
 
04:48:32.708 --> 04:48:32.718 align:start position:0%
recommendation question for Department
 
04:48:34.548 --> 04:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
representative love
 
04:48:35.830 --> 04:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
04:48:39.190 --> 04:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh Am I Wrong saying that
 
04:48:42.590 --> 04:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
um subcontractor independent contractor
 
04:48:44.868 --> 04:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
and freelance contractor are all one and
 
04:48:46.590 --> 04:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
the same just by different
 
04:48:48.750 --> 04:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
names I think that's part of what we're
 
04:48:51.830 --> 04:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out but the way that it
 
04:48:54.310 --> 04:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
appears in this particular Bill based
 
04:48:59.868 --> 04:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
upon Roman 4 a freelance worker is a
 
04:48:59.878 --> 04:49:01.190 align:start position:0%
upon Roman 4 a freelance worker is a
independent

04:49:01.190 --> 04:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
independent
 
04:49:03.670 --> 04:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
contractor so I think we're trying to
 
04:49:05.430 --> 04:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
figure that out as far as it as it
 
04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
relates to freelance worker based upon
 
04:49:08.990 --> 04:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
discussions that the Department's had
 
04:49:11.510 --> 04:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
with representative grassy um but an
 
04:49:14.350 --> 04:49:14.360 align:start position:0%
independent contractor a subcontractor
 
04:49:16.350 --> 04:49:16.360 align:start position:0%
is technically an independent contractor
 
04:49:18.868 --> 04:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
to the general contractor that hired
 
04:49:22.270 --> 04:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
them uh so unless we come up with a
 
04:49:24.270 --> 04:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
better definition or some other way to
 
04:49:25.230 --> 04:49:25.240 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:49:30.628 --> 04:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:32.910 --> 04:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
statement further
 
04:49:32.920 --> 04:49:34.510 align:start position:0%
statement further
questions

04:49:34.510 --> 04:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:49:37.310 --> 04:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:49:40.590 --> 04:49:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh that was the I don't have any other
 
04:49:43.470 --> 04:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
pink cards if there's anyone else who
 
04:49:46.510 --> 04:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to testify let me know otherwise
 
04:49:48.708 --> 04:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
representative Kum if you could pass the
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:02.840 --> 04:50:08.628 align:start position:0%
 
up

04:50:08.628 --> 04:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:13.548 --> 04:50:13.558 align:start position:0%
so uh we had two people sign in in
 
04:50:16.270 --> 04:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill on the blue
 
04:50:20.070 --> 04:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
sheet and then online we had six names
 
04:50:22.948 --> 04:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
in support and one in opposition and
 
04:50:25.830 --> 04:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
with that I will close the hearing
 
04:50:28.670 --> 04:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
on HB
 
04:50:32.548 --> 04:50:32.558 align:start position:0%
226 and we have uh just under 10 minutes
 
04:50:34.628 --> 04:50:34.638 align:start position:0%
until uh we're schedule for our next
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:02.760 --> 05:00:31.910 align:start position:0%
 
then

05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:31.920 --> 05:01:31.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:01:31.830 --> 05:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:31.840 --> 05:02:15.708 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:02:15.708 --> 05:02:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:31.430 --> 05:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:34.948 --> 05:02:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:39.150 --> 05:02:39.160 align:start position:0%
46 and once we get the
 
05:02:41.830 --> 05:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
people in who need in and out or need
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:58.110 --> 05:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
will I recognize the bill sponsor
 
05:02:59.470 --> 05:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
introduce uh thank you Mr chair members
 
05:03:00.788 --> 05:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
of the committee I have passed around
 
05:03:03.310 --> 05:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
written testimony um it is not a on the
 
05:03:05.070 --> 05:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
grounds that the money that you holding
 
05:03:07.670 --> 05:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
and looking at is entirely worthless it
 
05:03:10.070 --> 05:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
is worth nothing you can buy nothing
 
05:03:12.708 --> 05:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
with it but it is nice to have you can
 
05:03:14.750 --> 05:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
show it to your friends and has a big
 
05:03:16.708 --> 05:03:16.718 align:start position:0%
number on it but it is completely
 
05:03:18.470 --> 05:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
incapable of purchasing anything of any
 
05:03:21.150 --> 05:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
actual value and that is actually why I
 
05:03:23.430 --> 05:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
brought up this bill uh this is the gold
 
05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
Bill and what this bill does is it just
 
05:03:29.150 --> 05:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
adds a line to the list of legal ways to
 
05:03:31.708 --> 05:03:31.718 align:start position:0%
pay an employee uh who is uh either
 
05:03:33.510 --> 05:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
weekly or bi-weekly
 
05:03:36.150 --> 05:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
to just add gold and silver speci now it
 
05:03:38.470 --> 05:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
is already currently legal to pay them
 
05:03:41.590 --> 05:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
in gold and silver coins all right now
 
05:03:42.948 --> 05:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
this is the legal distinction that we
 
05:03:44.430 --> 05:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
probably don't run across very often in
 
05:03:46.910 --> 05:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
the labor committee a coin can only be
 
05:03:49.190 --> 05:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
gold and silver that is stamped by the
 
05:03:52.270 --> 05:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
treasury right if it's a round made by a
 
05:03:54.470 --> 05:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
private mint that's not a coin that's a
 
05:03:57.270 --> 05:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
round all right and that is a legal
 
05:03:58.750 --> 05:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
distinction of some importance because
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
you can pay someone in silver dollars
 
05:04:04.310 --> 05:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
that's totally fine you cannot pay them
 
05:04:07.708 --> 05:04:07.718 align:start position:0%
in in silver rounds and so that's what
 
05:04:11.390 --> 05:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
this uh legislation intends to fix um
 
05:04:13.310 --> 05:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
the reason for this is very simple I
 
05:04:14.430 --> 05:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if you guys noticed but
 
05:04:15.750 --> 05:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of inflation going
 
05:04:18.190 --> 05:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
on um it has the potential to go a lot
 
05:04:20.990 --> 05:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
worse uh I predicted back in 2020 that
 
05:04:22.430 --> 05:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
the actions of the Federal Reserve would
 
05:04:24.030 --> 05:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
lead to this level of inflation and
 
05:04:27.670 --> 05:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
worse I was 100% correct um and I
 
05:04:29.070 --> 05:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
believe it's going to get even worse
 
05:04:30.510 --> 05:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
because you just do the math on the
 
05:04:33.310 --> 05:04:33.320 align:start position:0%
monetary Supply it's not a good sign
 
05:04:34.990 --> 05:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
and the thing is people still need to
 
05:04:38.548 --> 05:04:38.558 align:start position:0%
buy food and like engage in basic trade
 
05:04:41.230 --> 05:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
and if you look at countries where the
 
05:04:43.590 --> 05:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
do where their money drops out it isn't
 
05:04:45.310 --> 05:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
a pretty sight people are losing weight
 
05:04:46.548 --> 05:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
really fast and it's not for a good
 
05:04:48.548 --> 05:04:48.558 align:start position:0%
reason is not something they want to do
 
05:04:49.788 --> 05:04:49.798 align:start position:0%
and it's not something that we people in
 
05:04:51.350 --> 05:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should have to deal with
 
05:04:53.948 --> 05:04:53.958 align:start position:0%
if it is at all avoidable and so the
 
05:04:56.030 --> 05:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
reason I I I am firmly of the opinion
 
05:04:57.750 --> 05:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
that the dollar is probably going to die
 
05:04:59.868 --> 05:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
within the next decade or so um I could
 
05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
be wrong and if I'm wrong um this bill
 
05:05:05.470 --> 05:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't really hurt anybody so there's
 
05:05:07.230 --> 05:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
that but the reason I say that it's
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
going to die soon is because of
 
05:05:11.350 --> 05:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
historical precedent so I'd like to talk
 
05:05:13.948 --> 05:05:13.958 align:start position:0%
about the Portuguese real uh that became
 
05:05:16.110 --> 05:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
the world Reserve currency uh World
 
05:05:17.670 --> 05:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
Reserve currency being a currency that
 
05:05:19.830 --> 05:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
other currencies are backed in around
 
05:05:20.628 --> 05:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
the year
 
05:05:23.190 --> 05:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
1450 it lasted for 80 years and then it
 
05:05:25.390 --> 05:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
died um it was replaced by the Spanish
 
05:05:26.990 --> 05:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
reel or the Spanish dollar these are the
 
05:05:28.670 --> 05:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
pieces of eight that the colonists use
 
05:05:30.990 --> 05:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
it that one lasted a very long time as
 
05:05:32.628 --> 05:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
far as world Reserve currencies go that
 
05:05:35.270 --> 05:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
lasted about 110 years and then it died
 
05:05:37.270 --> 05:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh the Dutch Gilder replaced it because
 
05:05:38.948 --> 05:05:38.958 align:start position:0%
the Dutch were sailing a lot more than
 
05:05:40.548 --> 05:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
the Spanish at that time I guess and
 
05:05:42.830 --> 05:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
that one lasted about 80 years 80 years
 
05:05:44.590 --> 05:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
again and then it died and that was
 
05:05:46.310 --> 05:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
replaced by the French Fran that became
 
05:05:48.110 --> 05:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
the world Reserve currency the currency
 
05:05:49.948 --> 05:05:49.958 align:start position:0%
dour that all the other countries backed
 
05:05:52.030 --> 05:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
their currency with and that one lasted
 
05:05:54.910 --> 05:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
95 years and then it died and it was
 
05:05:56.708 --> 05:05:56.718 align:start position:0%
replaced by the pound sterling the
 
05:05:58.190 --> 05:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
British were very very smart and they
 
05:05:59.548 --> 05:05:59.558 align:start position:0%
decided that what they would do is back
 
05:06:01.470 --> 05:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
their money with silver uh then World
 
05:06:03.390 --> 05:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
War II came along and they ran out of
 
05:06:04.670 --> 05:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
silver and gold and they didn't have
 
05:06:05.910 --> 05:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
anything to back it with so they started
 
05:06:09.110 --> 05:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
backing with dollars uh $44 originally
 
05:06:10.830 --> 05:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
and then that was drastically halfed
 
05:06:12.868 --> 05:06:12.878 align:start position:0%
after a little bit and that's how the
 
05:06:15.548 --> 05:06:15.558 align:start position:0%
pound sterling died and was no longer
 
05:06:17.310 --> 05:06:17.320 align:start position:0%
the world Reserve currency and the US
 
05:06:20.470 --> 05:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
dollar came in and uh it's been
 
05:06:22.910 --> 05:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
depending on when you count it about 80
 
05:06:26.070 --> 05:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
years um we're due and we had a really
 
05:06:29.510 --> 05:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
good run we're due um it is very
 
05:06:32.350 --> 05:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
uncommon for uh it it is unprecedent
 
05:06:34.470 --> 05:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
eded for a world Reserve currency to
 
05:06:37.030 --> 05:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
last more than 110 years the majority of
 
05:06:39.910 --> 05:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
them last between 80 and 95 years and
 
05:06:42.350 --> 05:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
then they go away but there is
 
05:06:45.190 --> 05:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
currency that holds its value forever
 
05:06:47.350 --> 05:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
and uh seems to be have been used for
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
Millennia and I have a little anecdote
 
05:06:51.788 --> 05:06:51.798 align:start position:0%
for you about that so in Genesis chapter
 
05:06:55.110 --> 05:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
23 Abraham buys a plot of land to bury
 
05:06:57.948 --> 05:06:57.958 align:start position:0%
his wife Sarah and he plays 400 shekels
 
05:07:00.230 --> 05:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
all right shekel that's silver uh that's
 
05:07:02.510 --> 05:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
roughly equal to 140 troy ounces if do
 
05:07:06.270 --> 05:07:06.280 align:start position:0%
the calculation because about. 35 uh uh
 
05:07:09.190 --> 05:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
troy ounces equals a shekele all right
 
05:07:14.110 --> 05:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
so 140 troy ounces is equal to about
 
05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
$3,430 okay now the populations in Canan
 
05:07:19.310 --> 05:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
at the time were a lot lower than they
 
05:07:21.470 --> 05:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
are in America right now uh so if you
 
05:07:23.030 --> 05:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
look at a place in America with a very
 
05:07:25.470 --> 05:07:25.480 align:start position:0%
low population such as Wyoming uh you
 
05:07:27.110 --> 05:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
can look online and the average cost for
 
05:07:30.430 --> 05:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
an acre of land in Wyoming is
 
05:07:32.470 --> 05:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
$3,434 now Abraham might not not have
 
05:07:34.230 --> 05:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
been buying an exactly one acre land I
 
05:07:35.510 --> 05:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if they used Acres at the
 
05:07:37.948 --> 05:07:37.958 align:start position:0%
time but that's from 3,000 years ago and
 
05:07:39.628 --> 05:07:39.638 align:start position:0%
that means that that silver that he was
 
05:07:42.510 --> 05:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
using at that time was probably melted
 
05:07:44.910 --> 05:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
down uh several times in the times you
 
05:07:46.868 --> 05:07:46.878 align:start position:0%
know coming after that and it's been
 
05:07:48.430 --> 05:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
traded and been in use for those
 
05:07:49.910 --> 05:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
thousands of years because it's not like
 
05:07:52.150 --> 05:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
silver just goes up and missing uh
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
people usually keep track of that sort
 
05:07:55.750 --> 05:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
of thing and all the silver that we have
 
05:07:58.110 --> 05:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
today all the gold that we have today a
 
05:08:00.708 --> 05:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
large portion of it has been around for
 
05:08:02.470 --> 05:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
hundreds of years and some of it for
 
05:08:07.030 --> 05:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
thousands of years so this this bill is
 
05:08:08.830 --> 05:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
essentially aimed at making sure that we
 
05:08:10.670 --> 05:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
have a safety net a little bit of an
 
05:08:12.830 --> 05:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
insurance policy just in case the dollar
 
05:08:16.190 --> 05:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
does really go the way of the dodo um if
 
05:08:17.590 --> 05:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
the dollar does not go the way of the
 
05:08:20.030 --> 05:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
dodo if the dollar survives if I'm a
 
05:08:21.708 --> 05:08:21.718 align:start position:0%
complete Quack and I don't have any
 
05:08:23.590 --> 05:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
understanding of Economics whatsoever
 
05:08:25.310 --> 05:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
then all we've managed to do by passing
 
05:08:26.788 --> 05:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is made a bunch of gold bugs
 
05:08:29.548 --> 05:08:29.558 align:start position:0%
and silver bugs very very happy um it
 
05:08:31.590 --> 05:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
will have no negative impact on the
 
05:08:34.548 --> 05:08:34.558 align:start position:0%
economy basically whatsoever because if
 
05:08:36.470 --> 05:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
the dollar is around and people can get
 
05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
paid in dollars people are probably
 
05:08:40.708 --> 05:08:40.718 align:start position:0%
going to prefer getting paid in dollars
 
05:08:42.830 --> 05:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's when things don't go well that this
 
05:08:47.590 --> 05:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
is there for and uh with that I will uh
 
05:08:49.590 --> 05:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
I will take any questions thank you for
 
05:08:51.548 --> 05:08:51.558 align:start position:0%
your testimony are there questions for
 
05:08:51.558 --> 05:08:52.470 align:start position:0%
your testimony are there questions for
the

05:08:52.470 --> 05:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative B
 
05:08:56.990 --> 05:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
Lon thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:08:59.350 --> 05:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
representative grer um I like the idea
 
05:09:02.510 --> 05:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
gold and silver like you said as always
 
05:09:04.750 --> 05:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
holds its value to a certain extent
 
05:09:06.830 --> 05:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
however um as an
 
05:09:09.270 --> 05:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
employer um gold and silver values
 
05:09:12.590 --> 05:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
fluctuate almost daily sometimes how do
 
05:09:15.390 --> 05:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
I uh withhold a certain amount of gold
 
05:09:18.190 --> 05:09:18.200 align:start position:0%
and silver that will maintain its value
 
05:09:19.670 --> 05:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
for the full quarter before I send it
 
05:09:21.310 --> 05:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
off to the feds or to the state or to
 
05:09:22.990 --> 05:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance how do I make
 
05:09:24.868 --> 05:09:24.878 align:start position:0%
sure it holds its value so I'm not
 
05:09:26.350 --> 05:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
asking the employee for more money at
 
05:09:28.510 --> 05:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
the end of the week or I have to make up
 
05:09:29.670 --> 05:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
the difference because I don't have
 
05:09:29.680 --> 05:09:30.548 align:start position:0%
the difference because I don't have
enough

05:09:30.548 --> 05:09:30.558 align:start position:0%
enough
 
05:09:33.830 --> 05:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
gold on hand to pay that
 
05:09:36.830 --> 05:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
bill uh so it would probably be the case
 
05:09:38.270 --> 05:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
I would let the private employer sort of
 
05:09:39.868 --> 05:09:39.878 align:start position:0%
figure out their own contracts uh it
 
05:09:41.310 --> 05:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make sense for us to sort
 
05:09:42.830 --> 05:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
of dictate to them how they should set
 
05:09:44.830 --> 05:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
up their contracts that being said they
 
05:09:46.510 --> 05:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
have an a legal obligation to pay the
 
05:09:49.230 --> 05:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
IRS and so they are probably either
 
05:09:51.750 --> 05:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
going to Define their contracts based on
 
05:09:53.948 --> 05:09:53.958 align:start position:0%
the price of gold or they're going to so
 
05:09:56.190 --> 05:09:56.200 align:start position:0%
for instance you know you get like uh
 
05:09:58.510 --> 05:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
100 Cho ounces a week for instance or
 
05:09:59.990 --> 05:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
they would Define their contrast based
 
05:10:01.750 --> 05:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
on whatever hourly rate salary that they
 
05:10:03.548 --> 05:10:03.558 align:start position:0%
normally with dollars and then merely
 
05:10:06.430 --> 05:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
pay out in gold and silver um you
 
05:10:07.990 --> 05:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the price of gold goes up
 
05:10:10.510 --> 05:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
and down I would I would make the claim
 
05:10:12.150 --> 05:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
that the price of silver and gold stays
 
05:10:13.868 --> 05:10:13.878 align:start position:0%
roughly the same and it is the dollar
 
05:10:15.510 --> 05:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
that goes up and down but that's a
 
05:10:18.670 --> 05:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
matter of perspective and um the amount
 
05:10:20.070 --> 05:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
that you would end up paying out that
 
05:10:21.670 --> 05:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
would be up for debate and anybody who
 
05:10:24.830 --> 05:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be using that early on right
 
05:10:26.070 --> 05:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
so anybody who's going to be doing that
 
05:10:27.548 --> 05:10:27.558 align:start position:0%
who's like oh wait it's legal to pay in
 
05:10:28.990 --> 05:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
gold and or pay employees in gold and
 
05:10:30.270 --> 05:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
silver now and any employee that's like
 
05:10:31.390 --> 05:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
oh hey I get to be paid in gold and
 
05:10:33.310 --> 05:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
silver now uh they're going to be able
 
05:10:35.628 --> 05:10:35.638 align:start position:0%
to figure that out uh to the specifics
 
05:10:37.990 --> 05:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
of that and when they do that if we ever
 
05:10:39.548 --> 05:10:39.558 align:start position:0%
are in a situation where everybody needs
 
05:10:41.150 --> 05:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
to hop on over to gold and silver
 
05:10:43.510 --> 05:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
because the dollar is worthless then uh
 
05:10:45.270 --> 05:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
we'll have those legal questions very
 
05:10:47.430 --> 05:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
very well fleshed out um so we can leave
 
05:10:53.030 --> 05:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:56.110 --> 05:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
beginning so I do have a a followup on
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
that um you mentioned the the tax
 
05:11:01.470 --> 05:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
implications which is where the federal
 
05:11:04.070 --> 05:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
government will get involved at the
 
05:11:07.030 --> 05:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
state level this is under the employee
 
05:11:10.948 --> 05:11:10.958 align:start position:0%
section so things like minimum wage
 
05:11:14.230 --> 05:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
other wage an hour does get the state
 
05:11:14.240 --> 05:11:15.548 align:start position:0%
other wage an hour does get the state
involved

05:11:15.548 --> 05:11:15.558 align:start position:0%
involved
 
05:11:19.430 --> 05:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
in the state has to understand what is
 
05:11:21.948 --> 05:11:21.958 align:start position:0%
the value of the money being exchanged
 
05:11:23.750 --> 05:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
and does it meet the statutory
 
05:11:26.430 --> 05:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
requirements so do you see any issues
 
05:11:29.230 --> 05:11:29.240 align:start position:0%
with calculating whether minimum wage
 
05:11:31.750 --> 05:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
has been paid calculating that sort of
 
05:11:31.760 --> 05:11:32.830 align:start position:0%
has been paid calculating that sort of
thing

05:11:32.830 --> 05:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:11:35.070 --> 05:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
um at at first anybody who is going to
 
05:11:36.470 --> 05:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
be taking gold and silver when the
 
05:11:39.150 --> 05:11:39.160 align:start position:0%
dollar isn't completely dead yet is very
 
05:11:41.590 --> 05:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
unlikely to be getting paid low enough
 
05:11:44.430 --> 05:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
so that the minimum wage is of a concern
 
05:11:46.548 --> 05:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
um that being said if the dollar dies
 
05:11:48.350 --> 05:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
then the minimum wage is basically
 
05:11:50.270 --> 05:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
meaningless with it so if you know the
 
05:11:51.430 --> 05:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
Venezuelan boulevards that you're
 
05:11:53.708 --> 05:11:53.718 align:start position:0%
looking at um that would probably meet
 
05:11:55.628 --> 05:11:55.638 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage of Venezuela at the
 
05:11:57.390 --> 05:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
time I don't know that for sure but I've
 
05:12:00.788 --> 05:12:00.798 align:start position:0%
L you know if if a $500 a crisp $500
 
05:12:02.708 --> 05:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
bill couldn't buy you a low of bread
 
05:12:04.150 --> 05:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
then you can pay someone well above the
 
05:12:05.910 --> 05:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and still not be paying
 
05:12:08.670 --> 05:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
them very much so as far as the minimum
 
05:12:10.390 --> 05:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
wage itself is concerned or other uh
 
05:12:12.990 --> 05:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
labor protections I don't believe so
 
05:12:14.270 --> 05:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
that it would be it would cause an
 
05:12:15.708 --> 05:12:15.718 align:start position:0%
actual conflict it would be something to
 
05:12:17.030 --> 05:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
figure out but at the same time I don't
 
05:12:18.150 --> 05:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
believe that it would actually cause a
 
05:12:20.910 --> 05:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
conflict all right thank you uh
 
05:12:23.350 --> 05:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative bushard thank you thank
 
05:12:24.830 --> 05:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
05:12:27.270 --> 05:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you for taking my
 
05:12:29.670 --> 05:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
question now how would this work out
 
05:12:32.628 --> 05:12:32.638 align:start position:0%
with my direct deposit if I got hey let
 
05:12:35.628 --> 05:12:35.638 align:start position:0%
call that's another bill um so there's
 
05:12:37.150 --> 05:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
another bill in Commerce and consumer
 
05:12:40.070 --> 05:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
affairs to uh handle direct deposits um
 
05:12:41.270 --> 05:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
well if you want to receive direct
 
05:12:42.548 --> 05:12:42.558 align:start position:0%
deposit and the bill that's in Commerce
 
05:12:44.670 --> 05:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
and Comm uh consumer affairs doesn't
 
05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
pass uh then I would not recommend
 
05:12:47.628 --> 05:12:47.638 align:start position:0%
taking your wages in gold and silver
 
05:12:48.868 --> 05:12:48.878 align:start position:0%
just tell your employee that employer
 
05:12:50.708 --> 05:12:50.718 align:start position:0%
that you don't want to do that and uh
 
05:12:52.590 --> 05:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
take your wages in dollars instead
 
05:12:56.270 --> 05:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
because gold is not easily sent over
 
05:12:59.590 --> 05:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
wire follow up okay so would that mean
 
05:13:01.830 --> 05:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
that I would not be able to pay my
 
05:13:04.868 --> 05:13:04.878 align:start position:0%
income taxes well the you how am I going
 
05:13:06.708 --> 05:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
to pay my income taxes with gold well
 
05:13:10.350 --> 05:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:15.110 --> 05:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
dollars okay so it's so I follow so that
 
05:13:18.110 --> 05:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
means I I'd have to go through another
 
05:13:20.310 --> 05:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
step so are you so you're talking about
 
05:13:21.708 --> 05:13:21.718 align:start position:0%
when you're paying your income taxes
 
05:13:23.390 --> 05:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
directly you're not doing withholding
 
05:13:25.868 --> 05:13:25.878 align:start position:0%
from the employer side right well
 
05:13:27.470 --> 05:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't well I guess you would have to
 
05:13:30.150 --> 05:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
keep money on the side to pay the IRS
 
05:13:33.230 --> 05:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
okay so it's okay thank you
 
05:13:33.240 --> 05:13:36.030 align:start position:0%
okay so it's okay thank you
representative

05:13:36.030 --> 05:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:38.430 --> 05:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
Sullivan as I read
 
05:13:42.430 --> 05:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
this um employees would have the option
 
05:13:46.030 --> 05:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
of um getting a check if uh the employer
 
05:13:46.040 --> 05:13:47.590 align:start position:0%
of um getting a check if uh the employer
was

05:13:47.590 --> 05:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:13:52.030 --> 05:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
um paying employees in sub paragraphs B
 
05:13:53.670 --> 05:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
C or
 
05:13:57.788 --> 05:13:57.798 align:start position:0%
D paragraph e is the one that deals with
 
05:14:01.190 --> 05:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
checks then you've got paragraph F which
 
05:14:04.270 --> 05:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
is gold or silver which by my
 
05:14:06.510 --> 05:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
interpretation means that an employer
 
05:14:09.270 --> 05:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
could choose to pay all of his or her
 
05:14:11.628 --> 05:14:11.638 align:start position:0%
employees in gold or silver whether they
 
05:14:14.390 --> 05:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
like it or not and you said earlier that
 
05:14:17.230 --> 05:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
PE people who um have a problem with
 
05:14:19.430 --> 05:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
this would probably choose to be paid in
 
05:14:22.150 --> 05:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
dollars the way this reads it's not the
 
05:14:24.070 --> 05:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
employees Choice it's the employer's
 
05:14:26.628 --> 05:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
choice and um now I'm going to have to
 
05:14:30.270 --> 05:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
take my lump of gold and find a way to
 
05:14:31.990 --> 05:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
convert it into dollars so I can can pay
 
05:14:33.750 --> 05:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
my income tax and actually buy some
 
05:14:36.310 --> 05:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
groceries um do you see a problem with
 
05:14:39.110 --> 05:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
that I I heard that mentioned in some
 
05:14:44.070 --> 05:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
newspaper uh the I I had I had a request
 
05:14:46.670 --> 05:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
with OS to draft an amendment to add
 
05:14:48.750 --> 05:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
explicitly if the employee likes it or
 
05:14:51.110 --> 05:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
whatever and is down uh but they haven't
 
05:14:53.708 --> 05:14:53.718 align:start position:0%
gotten it back to me um I don't think
 
05:14:55.868 --> 05:14:55.878 align:start position:0%
it's necessary but if people think it's
 
05:14:57.190 --> 05:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
necessary and they'll support the bill
 
05:14:58.750 --> 05:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
if that language is in there then I
 
05:15:00.430 --> 05:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
would definitely shoe hornet in because
 
05:15:02.110 --> 05:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
uh I don't see any problem with amending
 
05:15:04.110 --> 05:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
the bill so that it becomes more
 
05:15:06.110 --> 05:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
explicit that this would have to be
 
05:15:08.548 --> 05:15:08.558 align:start position:0%
voluntary on the part of the uh employee
 
05:15:10.350 --> 05:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
because even though I don't believe that
 
05:15:13.590 --> 05:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
it's very likely that an employer in uh
 
05:15:15.628 --> 05:15:15.638 align:start position:0%
would prefer to pay an employee in a
 
05:15:17.350 --> 05:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
non-inflationary currency when they can
 
05:15:19.948 --> 05:15:19.958 align:start position:0%
pay them with a currency that is
 
05:15:23.110 --> 05:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
inflationary um if that's a concern and
 
05:15:24.990 --> 05:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
if if if if people believe that that is
 
05:15:28.110 --> 05:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
a legitimate concern uh then the then I
 
05:15:30.270 --> 05:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
would ask them to support the bill after
 
05:15:32.310 --> 05:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
it's been amended with with the draft I
 
05:15:35.868 --> 05:15:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:38.910 --> 05:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
it representative kahill thank you Mr
 
05:15:40.548 --> 05:15:40.558 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative
 
05:15:44.470 --> 05:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
Granger uh if you are someone as you
 
05:15:46.110 --> 05:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
appear to be who is concerned about the
 
05:15:49.230 --> 05:15:49.240 align:start position:0%
dollar and and the the intrinsic value
 
05:15:51.510 --> 05:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
of gold don't you have the ability to
 
05:15:54.788 --> 05:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
take your $200 per term check and buy
 
05:15:56.070 --> 05:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
gold with it
 
05:15:59.110 --> 05:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
now you do um there are lots of costs
 
05:16:01.990 --> 05:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
associated with uh purchasing gold so so
 
05:16:03.030 --> 05:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
um you're going to have you're going to
 
05:16:05.230 --> 05:16:05.240 align:start position:0%
be paying above spot and that's a that's
 
05:16:07.270 --> 05:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
a Financial Risk that if you were an
 
05:16:08.628 --> 05:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
employee you wouldn't have to be dealing
 
05:16:10.150 --> 05:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
with because the because that hit would
 
05:16:13.788 --> 05:16:13.798 align:start position:0%
be taken by the employer followup follow
 
05:16:16.110 --> 05:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
up I'm sorry are you asking the employer
 
05:16:18.510 --> 05:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
to absorb a cost in order to pay the
 
05:16:20.830 --> 05:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
employees in Gold if they have to pay
 
05:16:23.190 --> 05:16:23.200 align:start position:0%
for checks too it's up to the if they
 
05:16:25.190 --> 05:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
want to pay the employee in gold and
 
05:16:27.230 --> 05:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
they uh then yes they would have to take
 
05:16:29.670 --> 05:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
the cost of purchasing the gold whatever
 
05:16:31.270 --> 05:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
that may entail if they get a fancy deal
 
05:16:33.750 --> 05:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
where they can get it with or can get it
 
05:16:35.548 --> 05:16:35.558 align:start position:0%
uh without having to pay anything much
 
05:16:37.030 --> 05:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
above the spot price and you know good
 
05:16:39.270 --> 05:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
for them but um yeah the employer would
 
05:16:41.270 --> 05:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
in fact have to uh pay for the means to
 
05:16:42.670 --> 05:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
pay them just sort of like if you need
 
05:16:44.788 --> 05:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
to pay an employee with a check you have
 
05:16:49.350 --> 05:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
to buy a bunch of checks and a
 
05:16:53.510 --> 05:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
printer indulge me uh since we're kind
 
05:16:55.670 --> 05:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
of accustomed to either direct deposit
 
05:16:57.390 --> 05:16:57.400 align:start position:0%
or or checks right now and I don't think
 
05:16:59.548 --> 05:16:59.558 align:start position:0%
checks are terribly expensive is isn't
 
05:17:01.788 --> 05:17:01.798 align:start position:0%
it seem kind of incredulous that we
 
05:17:03.590 --> 05:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
would ask employers to go into this
 
05:17:05.670 --> 05:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
Brave New Frontier and where are they
 
05:17:06.788 --> 05:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
going to get the gold where are they
 
05:17:09.110 --> 05:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
going to put the gold uh do they have to
 
05:17:12.510 --> 05:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
have a safe or an a security guard in
 
05:17:14.230 --> 05:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
order to protect their gold so that they
 
05:17:16.788 --> 05:17:16.798 align:start position:0%
can make payroll well if they if they
 
05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to do that then they don't
 
05:17:18.000 --> 05:17:19.510 align:start position:0%
don't want to do that then they don't
have

05:17:19.510 --> 05:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:17:22.708 --> 05:17:22.718 align:start position:0%
to I'm sure they're lining up right
 
05:17:22.718 --> 05:17:24.590 align:start position:0%
to I'm sure they're lining up right
thank

05:17:24.590 --> 05:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:17:26.830 --> 05:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:17:29.350 --> 05:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
avalani thank you Mr chairman it's not
 
05:17:32.390 --> 05:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
often that uh I have a followup when it
 
05:17:35.990 --> 05:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
when this bill is this good
 
05:17:38.948 --> 05:17:38.958 align:start position:0%
um the question I have is um you
 
05:17:42.270 --> 05:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um trading gold into um
 
05:17:43.788 --> 05:17:43.798 align:start position:0%
something you have to pay above spot
 
05:17:46.590 --> 05:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
price or something like that um would
 
05:17:49.990 --> 05:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
the seeing as the employer cannot pass
 
05:17:52.110 --> 05:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
cost onto the employee relating to their
 
05:17:54.230 --> 05:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
payroll acquisition whether it be
 
05:17:55.708 --> 05:17:55.718 align:start position:0%
through direct deposit a hand check or
 
05:17:56.910 --> 05:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
anything else they should be able to
 
05:17:58.390 --> 05:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
walk into a bank and get their full
 
05:18:01.390 --> 05:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
amount for as as stated on the check
 
05:18:04.030 --> 05:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
could that be a issue when they go and
 
05:18:05.910 --> 05:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
and have to pay a fee to get their
 
05:18:08.910 --> 05:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
amount of gold back in
 
05:18:11.708 --> 05:18:11.718 align:start position:0%
dollars so to make sure I understand the
 
05:18:14.070 --> 05:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
question you're asking is it C can you
 
05:18:17.350 --> 05:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
restate the question please so when we
 
05:18:19.150 --> 05:18:19.160 align:start position:0%
pay an employee we pay them with their
 
05:18:21.670 --> 05:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
fi value say he $500 a week if we give
 
05:18:24.190 --> 05:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
them $500 in gold and they have to pay a
 
05:18:26.510 --> 05:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
$25 fee to convert that into dollars and
 
05:18:29.110 --> 05:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
they only get $475 back will the
 
05:18:31.030 --> 05:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
employee be on the hook for that $25
 
05:18:33.910 --> 05:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
because now they no longer have $500 in
 
05:18:36.150 --> 05:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
Gold would the employer be on the hook
 
05:18:39.590 --> 05:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
for that because there's a fee
 
05:18:42.190 --> 05:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
follow Rae associated with cashing that
 
05:18:46.948 --> 05:18:46.958 align:start position:0%
gold in I I don't believe so um I I
 
05:18:50.590 --> 05:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:52.990 --> 05:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
no if this bill passed I don't see how
 
05:18:56.150 --> 05:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
that would be the case
 
05:18:59.948 --> 05:18:59.958 align:start position:0%
no representative stop thank
 
05:19:03.110 --> 05:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
you um
 
05:19:05.470 --> 05:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh right now an ounce of gold is worth
 
05:19:05.480 --> 05:19:06.708 align:start position:0%
uh right now an ounce of gold is worth
about

05:19:06.708 --> 05:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:19:09.510 --> 05:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
$2,000 and gold is pretty heavy and I'm
 
05:19:13.150 --> 05:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
not quite sure how large an ounce is um
 
05:19:14.750 --> 05:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
if you owed somebody
 
05:19:17.948 --> 05:19:17.958 align:start position:0%
$50 how would you pay them in Gold that
 
05:19:20.670 --> 05:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
is such a good question I would like to
 
05:19:22.670 --> 05:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
introduce to you a gold
 
05:19:26.590 --> 05:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
back so this is a $5 gold back note it
 
05:19:28.350 --> 05:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
is about the size of a paper dollar you
 
05:19:30.750 --> 05:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
can fold it everything like that and it
 
05:19:34.230 --> 05:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
is one 200th of a troy ounce um this is
 
05:19:36.670 --> 05:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
a single New Hampshire gold back and it
 
05:19:39.628 --> 05:19:39.638 align:start position:0%
is 1/ 1000th of a troy ounce this is
 
05:19:41.270 --> 05:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
worth about
 
05:19:43.708 --> 05:19:43.718 align:start position:0%
$423 so you could use Gold bags for such
 
05:19:45.948 --> 05:19:45.958 align:start position:0%
purposes if you so
 
05:19:49.110 --> 05:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
choose any other
 
05:19:52.548 --> 05:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
questions oh we do have one
 
05:19:54.590 --> 05:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
representative thank you again and and
 
05:19:55.430 --> 05:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the indigence
 
05:19:58.788 --> 05:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
representative Granger um is there a
 
05:20:00.548 --> 05:20:00.558 align:start position:0%
cost for trading in a gold back at the
 
05:20:00.558 --> 05:20:01.750 align:start position:0%
cost for trading in a gold back at the
bank

05:20:01.750 --> 05:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
bank
 
05:20:03.990 --> 05:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe most banks deal with
 
05:20:06.430 --> 05:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
goldbacks they do or they don't I I do
 
05:20:08.310 --> 05:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
not believe that most banks do um if you
 
05:20:10.510 --> 05:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
go to a coin dealer or something like
 
05:20:13.070 --> 05:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
that usually the markup is 100% above
 
05:20:17.270 --> 05:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
spot roughly about 100% thank
 
05:20:19.910 --> 05:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:20:23.430 --> 05:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
Kum thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:20:26.110 --> 05:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
representative grer for this uh last
 
05:20:28.310 --> 05:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
session I believe we had a bill in front
 
05:20:31.110 --> 05:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
of us regarding paying employees with an
 
05:20:34.628 --> 05:20:34.638 align:start position:0%
ATM card were you in favor of that bill
 
05:20:36.708 --> 05:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh I was kind of not in favor of that
 
05:20:39.548 --> 05:20:39.558 align:start position:0%
bill mostly because it seemed as though
 
05:20:41.868 --> 05:20:41.878 align:start position:0%
it I don't want to go off into the Weeds
 
05:20:45.628 --> 05:20:45.638 align:start position:0%
on that bill but it seemed to me as
 
05:20:47.750 --> 05:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
though see I don't want to say anything
 
05:20:48.948 --> 05:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
bad about people who come here or
 
05:20:52.190 --> 05:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
testify or any I'd rather not answer
 
05:20:53.628 --> 05:20:53.638 align:start position:0%
that question but I did oppose that bill
 
05:20:55.230 --> 05:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
I guess so I guess I am answering it but
 
05:20:56.350 --> 05:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
I don't want to go into the Weeds about
 
05:20:58.430 --> 05:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
why follow up follow
 
05:21:00.708 --> 05:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
up do you remember if there was a lot of
 
05:21:03.310 --> 05:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
com ation and concern over how the
 
05:21:05.110 --> 05:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
employee would be able to get paid and
 
05:21:06.830 --> 05:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
whether there would be fees associated
 
05:21:11.030 --> 05:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
with that ATM card uh yes thank
 
05:21:13.628 --> 05:21:13.638 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
05:21:16.110 --> 05:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:21:18.430 --> 05:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you have several cards
 
05:21:22.430 --> 05:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
on this and uh first up I am thinking
 
05:21:24.430 --> 05:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
leave the department to the end to
 
05:21:27.070 --> 05:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
answer all questions so first up I'd
 
05:21:29.910 --> 05:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
like to call Kate Horan representing the
 
05:21:32.350 --> 05:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of counties
 
05:21:34.390 --> 05:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
she is speaking in opposition to the
 
05:21:36.070 --> 05:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
bill is handing out some written
 
05:21:39.030 --> 05:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and we'll speak for two
 
05:21:41.868 --> 05:21:41.878 align:start position:0%
minutes yes thank you Mr chairman it's a
 
05:21:42.910 --> 05:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be in front of this
 
05:21:44.990 --> 05:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee twice in one day uh the
 
05:21:47.510 --> 05:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
association is opposed to House Bill
 
05:21:50.150 --> 05:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
1246 uh just to remind everyone the
 
05:21:52.230 --> 05:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
association represents all 10 counties
 
05:21:53.990 --> 05:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
with all of your elected and appointed
 
05:21:56.470 --> 05:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
officials uh your county administrators
 
05:21:58.470 --> 05:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
are extremely concerned about how this
 
05:22:01.510 --> 05:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
would be implemented
 
05:22:03.868 --> 05:22:03.878 align:start position:0%
they uh in addition to the questions
 
05:22:06.948 --> 05:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
about price fluctuation and does the
 
05:22:09.788 --> 05:22:09.798 align:start position:0%
price count when I'm running payroll
 
05:22:12.510 --> 05:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
does the price count when that employee
 
05:22:15.190 --> 05:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
comes to pick up their gold or silver
 
05:22:17.230 --> 05:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
there's also no requirement for the
 
05:22:19.868 --> 05:22:19.878 align:start position:0%
employee to say I want to be paid in
 
05:22:22.910 --> 05:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
gold and silver this week so it is our
 
05:22:24.868 --> 05:22:24.878 align:start position:0%
administrator's opinions that they would
 
05:22:26.670 --> 05:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
have to have gold and silver for every
 
05:22:29.590 --> 05:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
single employees paycheck at the County
 
05:22:32.030 --> 05:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
facility which would mean additional
 
05:22:36.750 --> 05:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
safe security um and additional costs we
 
05:22:38.750 --> 05:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
would also need additional staff hired
 
05:22:41.190 --> 05:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
at each County to do the conversion rate
 
05:22:43.548 --> 05:22:43.558 align:start position:0%
um so long story short they anticipate
 
05:22:46.230 --> 05:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
several increased costs associated with
 
05:22:48.430 --> 05:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
this bill and obviously there is no
 
05:22:50.788 --> 05:22:50.798 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism from the state to help
 
05:22:53.868 --> 05:22:53.878 align:start position:0%
us Implement that um I am happy to
 
05:22:56.230 --> 05:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony there but can take
 
05:22:58.910 --> 05:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
any questions to the best of my
 
05:23:01.470 --> 05:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
ability thank you I do have a question
 
05:23:05.110 --> 05:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
if I understood what the sponsor
 
05:23:07.708 --> 05:23:07.718 align:start position:0%
presented um
 
05:23:11.310 --> 05:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
and some of the points made about maybe
 
05:23:14.868 --> 05:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
it it's not organized the way it should
 
05:23:18.310 --> 05:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
be um but I understood his intent is
 
05:23:21.750 --> 05:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
that a an employer could offer this or
 
05:23:26.470 --> 05:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
not and um wouldn't it be the case that
 
05:23:28.510 --> 05:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
that the counties would not want to
 
05:23:30.868 --> 05:23:30.878 align:start position:0%
offer it and simply wouldn't rather than
 
05:23:32.708 --> 05:23:32.718 align:start position:0%
in Cur cost uh thank you for the
 
05:23:34.510 --> 05:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman I think we would
 
05:23:36.548 --> 05:23:36.558 align:start position:0%
want some clarifying language into the
 
05:23:38.430 --> 05:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
statute around that because there
 
05:23:40.830 --> 05:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
obviously is some confusion the way our
 
05:23:42.670 --> 05:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
administrators read it it is the
 
05:23:45.230 --> 05:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
employees Cho Choice as to whether how
 
05:23:47.788 --> 05:23:47.798 align:start position:0%
they are paid all right thank you
 
05:23:47.798 --> 05:23:51.030 align:start position:0%
they are paid all right thank you
further

05:23:51.030 --> 05:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:53.310 --> 05:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
05:23:54.910 --> 05:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
05:23:57.628 --> 05:23:57.638 align:start position:0%
testimony um next I would like to call
 
05:24:01.590 --> 05:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
Representative belshire uh I he is a
 
05:24:05.548 --> 05:24:05.558 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill and we'll speak
 
05:24:07.190 --> 05:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
for three
 
05:24:09.390 --> 05:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chair and members
 
05:24:11.910 --> 05:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh it's nice to be here
 
05:24:13.868 --> 05:24:13.878 align:start position:0%
before you for the first time in this
 
05:24:17.270 --> 05:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
committee so I'm going to try not to Bel
 
05:24:18.948 --> 05:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
labor points that have already been made
 
05:24:20.270 --> 05:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take this in a little bit of
 
05:24:22.830 --> 05:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
a different direction because
 
05:24:25.190 --> 05:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
frankly I don't see this as being
 
05:24:26.548 --> 05:24:26.558 align:start position:0%
something that's going to happen right
 
05:24:28.628 --> 05:24:28.638 align:start position:0%
now I'm not talking about this bill I'm
 
05:24:31.310 --> 05:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
talking about anybody electing both
 
05:24:33.628 --> 05:24:33.638 align:start position:0%
employer and employee electing to be
 
05:24:36.070 --> 05:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
paid in gold and silver it doesn't make
 
05:24:39.470 --> 05:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
sense under our current circumstances
 
05:24:41.310 --> 05:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
okay let me get that out right
 
05:24:41.320 --> 05:24:42.990 align:start position:0%
okay let me get that out right
now

05:24:42.990 --> 05:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:24:45.470 --> 05:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
however it is I think this may have
 
05:24:48.270 --> 05:24:48.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier it is possible perhaps
 
05:24:51.070 --> 05:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
even probable that America is going to
 
05:24:53.510 --> 05:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
lose Reserve currency status at some
 
05:24:55.670 --> 05:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
point in the coming years or
 
05:24:58.750 --> 05:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
so if that happens we are highly likely
 
05:25:00.350 --> 05:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
to experience a hyperinflationary
 
05:25:00.360 --> 05:25:02.830 align:start position:0%
to experience a hyperinflationary
environment

05:25:02.830 --> 05:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:04.310 --> 05:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
such environments have happened before
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
in history all we have to do is look at
 
05:25:10.708 --> 05:25:10.718 align:start position:0%
a famous example the Yar Republic what
 
05:25:13.868 --> 05:25:13.878 align:start position:0%
happened when the Yar Republic there
 
05:25:19.230 --> 05:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
Deutch Mark began skyrocketing in um
 
05:25:22.110 --> 05:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
relative uh disv
 
05:25:24.510 --> 05:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
valuation all of a sudden you would go I
 
05:25:26.948 --> 05:25:26.958 align:start position:0%
used to hear stories that people in uh
 
05:25:29.470 --> 05:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
in Yar Germany at the time would order
 
05:25:31.910 --> 05:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
their coffees two at a time
 
05:25:33.310 --> 05:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
because you sit down by the time you've
 
05:25:36.270 --> 05:25:36.280 align:start position:0%
drank the first one the price has
 
05:25:38.990 --> 05:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
doubled the thing is that is a threat
 
05:25:41.590 --> 05:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
that we're facing as a possibility not
 
05:25:43.150 --> 05:25:43.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily even a probability but it is
 
05:25:43.160 --> 05:25:44.910 align:start position:0%
necessarily even a probability but it is
a

05:25:44.910 --> 05:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:25:47.230 --> 05:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
possibility and if we were to put this
 
05:25:49.788 --> 05:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
in law and the way that I read this is
 
05:25:51.590 --> 05:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
it would require the ascent of both the
 
05:25:54.030 --> 05:25:54.040 align:start position:0%
employee and the employer to want to go
 
05:25:54.040 --> 05:25:54.868 align:start position:0%
employee and the employer to want to go
about

05:25:54.868 --> 05:25:54.878 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:25:58.230 --> 05:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
this it would put something in
 
05:26:01.070 --> 05:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
place that would be already existing
 
05:26:02.830 --> 05:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
because we all know that the speed of
 
05:26:04.788 --> 05:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
this legislature is nothing compared to
 
05:26:05.868 --> 05:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
the speed of
 
05:26:07.868 --> 05:26:07.878 align:start position:0%
hyperinflation so that's a very real
 
05:26:10.390 --> 05:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
threat that we could face and when such
 
05:26:14.230 --> 05:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
a thing happens it's not as though um
 
05:26:15.830 --> 05:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's not as though people are going to
 
05:26:18.750 --> 05:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
receive a their payment in gold and go
 
05:26:20.670 --> 05:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
some bank somewhere and turn that gold
 
05:26:22.830 --> 05:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
in for Dollar Cash and then go buy stuff
 
05:26:24.510 --> 05:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
with cash that's not what happens if you
 
05:26:27.030 --> 05:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
look at the Historical reality of what
 
05:26:28.708 --> 05:26:28.718 align:start position:0%
occurs in a hyperinflationary
 
05:26:31.070 --> 05:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
environment is people turn to things
 
05:26:33.070 --> 05:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
that have a store of value and they
 
05:26:35.868 --> 05:26:35.878 align:start position:0%
don't just get paid in it they trade in
 
05:26:39.628 --> 05:26:39.638 align:start position:0%
it they buy things with gold and silver
 
05:26:41.670 --> 05:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
this happened in wmart Germany most
 
05:26:43.750 --> 05:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
recently this happened in Venezuela just
 
05:26:46.350 --> 05:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
a few years back it's a very real
 
05:26:48.110 --> 05:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
phenomena so it's not it's not a matter
 
05:26:50.350 --> 05:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
of having to worry about the relative
 
05:26:53.270 --> 05:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
tradein values because people aren't
 
05:26:55.110 --> 05:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
going to be buying stuff in dollars if
 
05:26:57.230 --> 05:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
that were to happen now the other thing
 
05:26:58.430 --> 05:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
I would say is there is a second
 
05:26:59.868 --> 05:26:59.878 align:start position:0%
scenario under which something like this
 
05:27:02.430 --> 05:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
would be very valuable all across the
 
05:27:04.350 --> 05:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
world right now in fact Davos is meeting
 
05:27:06.868 --> 05:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
at this moment among their agenda items
 
05:27:08.030 --> 05:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
is something that's been going on all
 
05:27:09.830 --> 05:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
over the world to include America the
 
05:27:12.350 --> 05:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve and the European Union
 
05:27:14.070 --> 05:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
they're talking about Central Bank
 
05:27:16.430 --> 05:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
digital currencies now multiple
 
05:27:17.750 --> 05:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
presidential candidates have worned
 
05:27:19.708 --> 05:27:19.718 align:start position:0%
about warned about the threat that these
 
05:27:21.670 --> 05:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
could pose now if they were done in the
 
05:27:24.470 --> 05:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
correct way which would be a freedom
 
05:27:26.030 --> 05:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
loving kind of way they could be very
 
05:27:28.470 --> 05:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
useful tools but what we've learned so
 
05:27:30.150 --> 05:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
far including from quotes from Jerome
 
05:27:32.510 --> 05:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
Powell is these that what is being
 
05:27:35.270 --> 05:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
designed right now and being piloted by
 
05:27:37.628 --> 05:27:37.638 align:start position:0%
the New York Federal Reserve is not a
 
05:27:40.270 --> 05:27:40.280 align:start position:0%
privacy respecting thing it is something
 
05:27:43.910 --> 05:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
that will if implemented give government
 
05:27:48.350 --> 05:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
the ability to stop transactions at
 
05:27:51.830 --> 05:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
will and we need to be able to provide
 
05:27:55.190 --> 05:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
our people with the ability to continue
 
05:27:57.948 --> 05:27:57.958 align:start position:0%
on with their daily lives in the event
 
05:28:00.470 --> 05:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
that the dollar would be phased out in
 
05:28:02.670 --> 05:28:02.680 align:start position:0%
favor of a central bank digital currency
 
05:28:05.110 --> 05:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
that was in a very bad way and that's
 
05:28:07.190 --> 05:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
certainly not a pie in the sky kind of
 
05:28:08.270 --> 05:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
thing because I can think of at least
 
05:28:09.548 --> 05:28:09.558 align:start position:0%
what two or three times in the history
 
05:28:11.030 --> 05:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
of America where the currency has been
 
05:28:13.310 --> 05:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
phased out for a new one so this this
 
05:28:15.190 --> 05:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
happens every once in a while and we
 
05:28:17.430 --> 05:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
might be coming up on another one very
 
05:28:19.628 --> 05:28:19.638 align:start position:0%
soon and with that I'm happy to take
 
05:28:21.708 --> 05:28:21.718 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
05:28:24.868 --> 05:28:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:27.310 --> 05:28:27.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you again
 
05:28:28.788 --> 05:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
for your
 
05:28:32.510 --> 05:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
testimony um next up I would would like
 
05:28:34.590 --> 05:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
to call Katherine heck who is
 
05:28:36.350 --> 05:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire Municipal
 
05:28:38.590 --> 05:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
Association and speaking in opposition
 
05:28:42.030 --> 05:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:44.670 --> 05:28:44.680 align:start position:0%
minutes good evening Miss good evening
 
05:28:46.628 --> 05:28:46.638 align:start position:0%
my goodness I don't know where I am good
 
05:28:48.150 --> 05:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chairman and members of the
 
05:28:49.670 --> 05:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
05:28:51.190 --> 05:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
Katherine heck and I represent the New
 
05:28:53.868 --> 05:28:53.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association in 234
 
05:28:56.430 --> 05:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
cities in towns in New Hampshire um I
 
05:28:58.510 --> 05:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
don't try not to belabor but just add to
 
05:29:00.948 --> 05:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
prior testimony that we are opposed to
 
05:29:02.830 --> 05:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
this bill because we share concerns on
 
05:29:04.830 --> 05:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
how we would implement this bill and do
 
05:29:06.990 --> 05:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
so cost effectively as a stewards of
 
05:29:09.548 --> 05:29:09.558 align:start position:0%
public funds tax dollars we are really
 
05:29:10.990 --> 05:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
not in the position to be in the
 
05:29:12.670 --> 05:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
Commodities Market where I started my
 
05:29:15.708 --> 05:29:15.718 align:start position:0%
career on Wall Street um so I will say
 
05:29:18.548 --> 05:29:18.558 align:start position:0%
that under current federal law 31 us
 
05:29:22.350 --> 05:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
code 513 legal tender silver and gold
 
05:29:25.868 --> 05:29:25.878 align:start position:0%
that are not minted by the US Treasury
 
05:29:28.190 --> 05:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
um are not recognized as payment for
 
05:29:30.470 --> 05:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
debts or recognized in federally
 
05:29:33.310 --> 05:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
chartered Banks so they will not conduct
 
05:29:35.110 --> 05:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
transactions in that commodity so to
 
05:29:36.750 --> 05:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
answer your question you cannot bring
 
05:29:38.670 --> 05:29:38.680 align:start position:0%
this to any ferally Chartered bank and
 
05:29:42.548 --> 05:29:42.558 align:start position:0%
trade it um the United States versus car
 
05:29:45.190 --> 05:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
um the ninth Circuit Court ruled in 2013
 
05:29:47.150 --> 05:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
that payroll taxes and how they must be
 
05:29:49.310 --> 05:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
assessed would be calculated on the fair
 
05:29:51.788 --> 05:29:51.798 align:start position:0%
market value at the time of the
 
05:29:54.470 --> 05:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
transaction as taxable property so why
 
05:29:55.948 --> 05:29:55.958 align:start position:0%
we would not have any additional payroll
 
05:29:57.548 --> 05:29:57.558 align:start position:0%
tax here in New Hampshire on silver and
 
05:30:00.750 --> 05:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
gold certainly the IRS would
 
05:30:03.230 --> 05:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
now because of that subsequent law there
 
05:30:07.030 --> 05:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
have been IRS guidelines um issued based
 
05:30:09.868 --> 05:30:09.878 align:start position:0%
on how you would calculate that and when
 
05:30:11.750 --> 05:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
and you are subject to audit if you are
 
05:30:13.470 --> 05:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
transacting in silver and gold to make
 
05:30:15.510 --> 05:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
sure it's the timing that agrees with
 
05:30:17.708 --> 05:30:17.718 align:start position:0%
the IRS standards for paying those
 
05:30:19.830 --> 05:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
payroll taxes when the commodity was
 
05:30:22.590 --> 05:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
traded so I think it opens up um a
 
05:30:24.548 --> 05:30:24.558 align:start position:0%
myriad of concerns that we would have in
 
05:30:26.350 --> 05:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
trying to implement this I would
 
05:30:27.708 --> 05:30:27.718 align:start position:0%
certainly defer to the Department of
 
05:30:30.070 --> 05:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
Labor to um discuss whether or not this
 
05:30:32.830 --> 05:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
is is a mandate on the employer to pay
 
05:30:34.830 --> 05:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
if the employee asks or whether it's
 
05:30:36.190 --> 05:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
mutual or whether it's up to the
 
05:30:40.270 --> 05:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
employer but RSA 4129 does require that
 
05:30:42.670 --> 05:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
we have internal controls around and we
 
05:30:45.070 --> 05:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
Safeguard all of our funds so in
 
05:30:47.030 --> 05:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
addition to physical concerns around
 
05:30:49.948 --> 05:30:49.958 align:start position:0%
this commodity we would also have um
 
05:30:51.948 --> 05:30:51.958 align:start position:0%
concerns around how we would deposit how
 
05:30:54.548 --> 05:30:54.558 align:start position:0%
we would trade where we would trade um
 
05:30:56.110 --> 05:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
as we talked about this is traded on the
 
05:30:58.910 --> 05:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
OTC in London the US futures the comx
 
05:31:02.270 --> 05:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
market and High Gold Exchange and I did
 
05:31:04.350 --> 05:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
pull up what gold was trading at today
 
05:31:08.548 --> 05:31:08.558 align:start position:0%
because that's fun it is um trading at
 
05:31:13.230 --> 05:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
$214 per ounce up1 n% from yesterday's
 
05:31:16.708 --> 05:31:16.718 align:start position:0%
price of $210 compared to last week
 
05:31:18.510 --> 05:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
Gold's down
 
05:31:22.270 --> 05:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
88.5% and a 52- we high is
 
05:31:26.230 --> 05:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
2,121 a 52 we low is
 
05:31:29.430 --> 05:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
1,982 so I guess to most simply equate
 
05:31:30.750 --> 05:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
how we would do as the government
 
05:31:32.868 --> 05:31:32.878 align:start position:0%
Finance adviser the accounting around
 
05:31:34.788 --> 05:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
these dollars that is one of my main
 
05:31:37.030 --> 05:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
roles is we would be having and
 
05:31:38.670 --> 05:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
employers as well it would be much like
 
05:31:40.110 --> 05:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
when you do foreign exchange
 
05:31:42.390 --> 05:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
transactions when you travel that's how
 
05:31:43.868 --> 05:31:43.878 align:start position:0%
we would be trying to calculate these
 
05:31:45.830 --> 05:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
transactions and our concern is we are
 
05:31:48.390 --> 05:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
not in the business of ever losing or
 
05:31:51.270 --> 05:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
having a decreased value tax dollar we
 
05:31:53.470 --> 05:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
really need dollar for dollar so in
 
05:31:55.948 --> 05:31:55.958 align:start position:0%
looking at one of the examples presented
 
05:31:59.430 --> 05:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
if I paid an employee $500 in gold at
 
05:32:01.230 --> 05:32:01.240 align:start position:0%
that value at that time and everything
 
05:32:03.470 --> 05:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
worked with the IRS and it was fine then
 
05:32:06.270 --> 05:32:06.280 align:start position:0%
they would have I had to buy that buy
 
05:32:09.070 --> 05:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
that amount so maybe it cost me
 
05:32:12.548 --> 05:32:12.558 align:start position:0%
$525 for that $500 worth of gold and
 
05:32:14.190 --> 05:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
then when the employee goes to use it to
 
05:32:16.030 --> 05:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
buy groceries pay bills or whatever the
 
05:32:19.350 --> 05:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
case maybe they have to go to a a I
 
05:32:20.788 --> 05:32:20.798 align:start position:0%
guess right now there's gold coin
 
05:32:22.270 --> 05:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
dealers pawn shops they have to go
 
05:32:24.230 --> 05:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere else to transact that so we're
 
05:32:27.390 --> 05:32:27.400 align:start position:0%
really devaluing twice that the value of
 
05:32:29.150 --> 05:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
the US dollar and I do understand some
 
05:32:31.350 --> 05:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
of the concerns presented around the
 
05:32:33.470 --> 05:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
value of of the dollar but we did
 
05:32:35.910 --> 05:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
decouple many years ago right we
 
05:32:38.590 --> 05:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
decoupled from the gold standard so we
 
05:32:40.430 --> 05:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
share we are concerned we share some
 
05:32:42.150 --> 05:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
similar concerns as the counties and I'm
 
05:32:44.910 --> 05:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to take any questions
 
05:32:48.270 --> 05:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
05:32:51.150 --> 05:32:51.160 align:start position:0%
questions representative kahill thank
 
05:32:54.788 --> 05:32:54.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Miss HEC uh
 
05:32:56.310 --> 05:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
is it safe to assume that you didn't
 
05:32:58.948 --> 05:32:58.958 align:start position:0%
injure your wrist by lifting your
 
05:32:58.958 --> 05:33:01.590 align:start position:0%
injure your wrist by lifting your
paycheck

05:33:01.590 --> 05:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
paycheck
 
05:33:03.590 --> 05:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
yes yes sir thank
 
05:33:07.750 --> 05:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
you any other questions representative
 
05:33:10.070 --> 05:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
balani uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:33:12.590 --> 05:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question M organ um
 
05:33:17.030 --> 05:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'm Sorry Miss heck my apologies
 
05:33:21.150 --> 05:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
um so similar question $500 um employer
 
05:33:23.670 --> 05:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
has to pay uh employee needs to be able
 
05:33:25.628 --> 05:33:25.638 align:start position:0%
to take their check to the bank and have
 
05:33:28.548 --> 05:33:28.558 align:start position:0%
no fees on cashing their check there
 
05:33:31.270 --> 05:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
would be a fee related to cashing
 
05:33:33.548 --> 05:33:33.558 align:start position:0%
through gold at a supplement
 
05:33:35.708 --> 05:33:35.718 align:start position:0%
supplementary banking
 
05:33:38.270 --> 05:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
institution um would the employer be
 
05:33:41.830 --> 05:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for that fee I have not
 
05:33:46.110 --> 05:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
found any case law to either affirm or
 
05:33:49.270 --> 05:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
dispute that claim so I do believe once
 
05:33:52.270 --> 05:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
the transaction has been completed the
 
05:33:54.070 --> 05:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
employee would be responsible for how
 
05:33:55.990 --> 05:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
I'm interpreting it because it trans you
 
05:33:57.708 --> 05:33:57.718 align:start position:0%
know the employer made the employee
 
05:34:00.150 --> 05:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
whole but I think it could be for
 
05:34:02.390 --> 05:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
interpretation when I bought the gold
 
05:34:04.230 --> 05:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
I'd have to have extra stores on hand
 
05:34:05.788 --> 05:34:05.798 align:start position:0%
because they fluctuate in price I don't
 
05:34:08.510 --> 05:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
know how I'm paying 89 cents if the gold
 
05:34:10.910 --> 05:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
back is worth some other amount although
 
05:34:12.750 --> 05:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
I am a town Treasurer and I do look
 
05:34:15.030 --> 05:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
forward to desk fulls of gold no I'm
 
05:34:17.470 --> 05:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
just kidding I'm just teasing I
 
05:34:19.948 --> 05:34:19.958 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have said that um it is an
 
05:34:23.230 --> 05:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
interesting concept though so I we are
 
05:34:25.070 --> 05:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
concerned though that it really does
 
05:34:26.990 --> 05:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
devalue if I had to go and gold happen
 
05:34:29.190 --> 05:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
to be traded low that day and I have to
 
05:34:31.390 --> 05:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
go I mean I live in a very small town I
 
05:34:33.868 --> 05:34:33.878 align:start position:0%
might have to travel 20 or 50 miles to
 
05:34:35.430 --> 05:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
get that gold I'd have to do it on a
 
05:34:37.430 --> 05:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
convenient day to make sure it's open
 
05:34:39.350 --> 05:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's secure and then by the time I pay
 
05:34:41.628 --> 05:34:41.638 align:start position:0%
the employee that gold could be higher
 
05:34:43.708 --> 05:34:43.718 align:start position:0%
or lower in value and then by the time
 
05:34:46.628 --> 05:34:46.638 align:start position:0%
the employee goes to trade it back it
 
05:34:48.868 --> 05:34:48.878 align:start position:0%
could be higher or lower in value and
 
05:34:50.990 --> 05:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
that that is a real concern depending on
 
05:34:54.110 --> 05:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
the market um and Market volatility
 
05:34:56.830 --> 05:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and and I should add that
 
05:34:59.030 --> 05:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
there is there is a fee associated with
 
05:35:00.390 --> 05:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
these transactions because these are
 
05:35:02.990 --> 05:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
private businesses dealing in silver and
 
05:35:04.670 --> 05:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
gold currently there's not a banking
 
05:35:06.590 --> 05:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
institution where you give a dollar and
 
05:35:07.910 --> 05:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
you get a dollar or you give a

05:35:50.910 --> 05:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:53.470 --> 05:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
testimony all right good afternoon my
 
05:35:55.788 --> 05:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
name is Tracy McGraw I'm an attorney in
 
05:35:57.708 --> 05:35:57.718 align:start position:0%
Le legislative leaon with the Department
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
of Labor and thank you for giving me the
 
05:36:03.350 --> 05:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to answer some of the qu
 
05:36:05.548 --> 05:36:05.558 align:start position:0%
there were an abundance of questions so
 
05:36:07.510 --> 05:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you to repeat some of
 
05:36:10.070 --> 05:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
the questions that you want to but I'll
 
05:36:12.350 --> 05:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
do the best that I can to remember some
 
05:36:16.190 --> 05:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
of this um one of the issues I did want
 
05:36:19.990 --> 05:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
to point out was cost of the
 
05:36:23.270 --> 05:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
employee section 27543 specifically
 
05:36:25.470 --> 05:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
states in the first paragraph that to be
 
05:36:27.230 --> 05:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
able to use the money that's being paid
 
05:36:29.670 --> 05:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
for wages it has to be at a cost no cost
 
05:36:32.110 --> 05:36:32.120 align:start position:0%
cost to the employee so that takes care
 
05:36:35.270 --> 05:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
of that problem um whether the employer
 
05:36:37.948 --> 05:36:37.958 align:start position:0%
chooses to Bear those costs that's going
 
05:36:40.230 --> 05:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
to be up to the employer but the statute
 
05:36:41.948 --> 05:36:41.958 align:start position:0%
already protects the employee from
 
05:36:44.868 --> 05:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
having to pay that there was another
 
05:36:49.470 --> 05:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
issue as far as the um arrangement of
 
05:36:54.190 --> 05:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
bcde and F in this particular issue the
 
05:36:55.868 --> 05:36:55.878 align:start position:0%
way the department would
 
05:36:55.878 --> 05:36:58.230 align:start position:0%
way the department would
interpret

05:36:58.230 --> 05:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
interpret
 
05:37:00.190 --> 05:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
27543 is
 
05:37:04.230 --> 05:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
number one would be payment in lawful
 
05:37:07.030 --> 05:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
money of the United States
 
05:37:09.750 --> 05:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
so it'll be interesting after the
 
05:37:12.430 --> 05:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
discussions today and after what
 
05:37:15.110 --> 05:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative Granger is is discussing
 
05:37:17.230 --> 05:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
and and mentioning in his bill lawful
 
05:37:19.110 --> 05:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
money at this point in time is
 
05:37:23.948 --> 05:37:23.958 align:start position:0%
Cash um and so that's option A and then
 
05:37:27.110 --> 05:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
we go into the other options option b is
 
05:37:30.030 --> 05:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
electronic fund transfer option C is
 
05:37:31.470 --> 05:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
direct deposit with written
 
05:37:34.868 --> 05:37:34.878 align:start position:0%
authorization from the employee option D
 
05:37:36.910 --> 05:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
is the payroll
 
05:37:39.948 --> 05:37:39.958 align:start position:0%
card currently option e
 
05:37:43.470 --> 05:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
says that if your employer if you don't
 
05:37:46.230 --> 05:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
want B C or D you can ask your employer
 
05:37:49.150 --> 05:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
to pay by check at a local bank local to
 
05:37:51.230 --> 05:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
the business so that the employee if
 
05:37:53.230 --> 05:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
they have to go to the business it is a
 
05:37:56.190 --> 05:37:56.200 align:start position:0%
local location for that um we recently
 
05:37:58.110 --> 05:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
had a situation where someone had a bank
 
05:38:01.548 --> 05:38:01.558 align:start position:0%
in in Seattle was not local here but the
 
05:38:03.948 --> 05:38:03.958 align:start position:0%
business was actually local here that
 
05:38:05.110 --> 05:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
had to be
 
05:38:07.070 --> 05:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
fixed don't
 
05:38:12.270 --> 05:38:12.280 align:start position:0%
ask um so just as housekeeping only
 
05:38:16.350 --> 05:38:16.360 align:start position:0%
switching and putting gold and silver
 
05:38:22.270 --> 05:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
after d as e so to speak taking current
 
05:38:26.470 --> 05:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
e and bumping it out to F would then
 
05:38:29.548 --> 05:38:29.558 align:start position:0%
give the employee the option of any of
 
05:38:33.670 --> 05:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
of those B CDE e being gold and
 
05:38:37.230 --> 05:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
silver cash and then the last one F
 
05:38:40.590 --> 05:38:40.600 align:start position:0%
being check on a local institution at no
 
05:38:42.510 --> 05:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
cost to the
 
05:38:44.670 --> 05:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
employee so that might help with a
 
05:38:46.708 --> 05:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
little bit of
 
05:38:46.718 --> 05:38:49.230 align:start position:0%
little bit of
housekeeping

05:38:49.230 --> 05:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
housekeeping
 
05:38:53.190 --> 05:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Labor has some
 
05:38:56.708 --> 05:38:56.718 align:start position:0%
concerns with respect to how to address
 
05:38:59.548 --> 05:38:59.558 align:start position:0%
some of the issues involved here uh we
 
05:39:01.788 --> 05:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
talked about the value of gold I pulled
 
05:39:03.830 --> 05:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
up one I know that representative stab
 
05:39:07.750 --> 05:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
said something about it um the value of
 
05:39:12.190 --> 05:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
gold it does change so if an employee is
 
05:39:15.510 --> 05:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
paid at 5 o' and they agree at 5 o'clock
 
05:39:17.990 --> 05:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
that the value of their paycheck is $500
 
05:39:19.548 --> 05:39:19.558 align:start position:0%
and they're handed something that is the
 
05:39:22.590 --> 05:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
equivalent of $500 in
 
05:39:25.990 --> 05:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
Gold what if on Monday that $500 is now
 
05:39:28.708 --> 05:39:28.718 align:start position:0%
worth $ 250 can they come back in for a
 
05:39:30.628 --> 05:39:30.638 align:start position:0%
wage claim with the employer and say you
 
05:39:32.190 --> 05:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
owe me another
 
05:39:34.430 --> 05:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
$250 we don't know the answer to that
 
05:39:35.990 --> 05:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
question but it definitely poses a
 
05:39:37.190 --> 05:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
problem and it's definitely going to
 
05:39:39.310 --> 05:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
come to the Department of
 
05:39:41.910 --> 05:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
Labor the reverse is the same will the
 
05:39:43.468 --> 05:39:43.478 align:start position:0%
employer be able to ask for
 
05:39:45.868 --> 05:39:45.878 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of pay if the person was
 
05:39:48.948 --> 05:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
overpaid because on Monday his his pay
 
05:39:51.510 --> 05:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
is now worth $1,000 instead of the 500
 
05:39:53.910 --> 05:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
to which he was actually owed so that's
 
05:39:56.868 --> 05:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
a concern that we have
 
05:40:00.350 --> 05:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
um the issues I I believe the the last
 
05:40:03.910 --> 05:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
speaker U Miss HEC testified to the US
 
05:40:07.350 --> 05:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
statute which talks about that what
 
05:40:09.030 --> 05:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
legal tender is is that which is
 
05:40:11.110 --> 05:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
produced by the Federal Reserve based
 
05:40:15.390 --> 05:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
upon the uh us code at least as it is
 
05:40:18.590 --> 05:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
currently it's unclear whether
 
05:40:21.510 --> 05:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative Granger wants to turn
 
05:40:24.990 --> 05:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
gold and silver to be legal tender which
 
05:40:26.788 --> 05:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
is unclear also whether or not a
 
05:40:28.350 --> 05:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment needs to be
 
05:40:30.150 --> 05:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
done to do that
 
05:40:32.990 --> 05:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
or if this is just gold and silver is
 
05:40:34.788 --> 05:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
gold and silver
 
05:40:37.548 --> 05:40:37.558 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know what legal tender in
 
05:40:40.150 --> 05:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
the minds of those that are exchanging
 
05:40:43.350 --> 05:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
it um one of the things that
 
05:40:46.350 --> 05:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
representative Granger brought up that
 
05:40:48.750 --> 05:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
it brings up the concern about
 
05:40:52.230 --> 05:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
valuation was that gold back which I'd
 
05:40:53.430 --> 05:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
never seen
 
05:40:57.110 --> 05:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
before but when asked the value or when
 
05:40:59.868 --> 05:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
spoken the value he said I may have the
 
05:41:02.788 --> 05:41:02.798 align:start position:0%
numbers wrong but the the word was right
 
05:41:02.798 --> 05:41:05.990 align:start position:0%
numbers wrong but the the word was right
about

05:41:05.990 --> 05:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:10.990 --> 05:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
$423 so how is about going to be
 
05:41:14.510 --> 05:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
exchanged and done in an accurate Manner
 
05:41:16.670 --> 05:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
and that's a concern this is this is not
 
05:41:18.468 --> 05:41:18.478 align:start position:0%
a this is not a criticism these are
 
05:41:21.110 --> 05:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
concerns that we would have to deal with
 
05:41:22.708 --> 05:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about wages when
 
05:41:24.390 --> 05:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the calculation of
 
05:41:26.310 --> 05:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
average weekly wages for workers comp
 
05:41:29.350 --> 05:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
cases when we're talking about wages for
 
05:41:31.270 --> 05:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
a wage in hour case where an employee is
 
05:41:32.948 --> 05:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
looking to be reimbursed for wages that
 
05:41:34.270 --> 05:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
they believe that they're
 
05:41:37.750 --> 05:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
owed and that's that's what I'm looking
 
05:41:40.150 --> 05:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
at here this is this is not any type of
 
05:41:42.390 --> 05:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
a negative or derogatory comment being
 
05:41:44.548 --> 05:41:44.558 align:start position:0%
made but these are the concerns that we
 
05:41:48.230 --> 05:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
have on how we can enforce this and how
 
05:41:50.590 --> 05:41:50.600 align:start position:0%
can we do this in a fair way that's
 
05:41:54.948 --> 05:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
going to be acceptable to everyone in in
 
05:41:58.150 --> 05:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
the picture
 
05:42:00.390 --> 05:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
um why don't you ask me some of the
 
05:42:02.070 --> 05:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
other questions that you had because I
 
05:42:03.750 --> 05:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
have a page of notes here that's all
 
05:42:05.990 --> 05:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
over the place all right I would like to
 
05:42:07.708 --> 05:42:07.718 align:start position:0%
ask you a question that kind of strings
 
05:42:10.390 --> 05:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
together some of the things you said and
 
05:42:12.548 --> 05:42:12.558 align:start position:0%
hopefully it will come off in the way
 
05:42:13.830 --> 05:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
that I intend it because it's not
 
05:42:18.708 --> 05:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
supposed to be complicated so um right
 
05:42:22.430 --> 05:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
now and if if we we don't change the law
 
05:42:27.310 --> 05:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
If an employer and employee agreed to
 
05:42:29.708 --> 05:42:29.718 align:start position:0%
pay tied to
 
05:42:32.350 --> 05:42:32.360 align:start position:0%
a wage tied to a commodity so let's say
 
05:42:35.948 --> 05:42:35.958 align:start position:0%
I'm in the logging business and so I say
 
05:42:39.150 --> 05:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to pay you you know X the
 
05:42:41.230 --> 05:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
value of on Friday I'm going to give you
 
05:42:43.150 --> 05:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
the X amount of whatever the lumber
 
05:42:46.270 --> 05:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
price is could I
 
05:42:49.590 --> 05:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
legally agree to that under employment
 
05:42:52.270 --> 05:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
law or does that go back to this issue
 
05:42:55.030 --> 05:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
of legal tender and the Department's
 
05:42:57.390 --> 05:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
going to require that at some point that
 
05:43:00.350 --> 05:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
be reduced to a dollar figure
 
05:43:03.070 --> 05:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
that then can
 
05:43:05.990 --> 05:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
be work with I think I understand what
 
05:43:08.830 --> 05:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
you're asking I do okay so and I think
 
05:43:10.628 --> 05:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
that also goes back to the definition
 
05:43:13.390 --> 05:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
that was given for legal tender for um
 
05:43:16.670 --> 05:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
the US code which clearly says United
 
05:43:18.948 --> 05:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
States Coins and currency so we're
 
05:43:20.670 --> 05:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
talking about coins and currency that
 
05:43:24.468 --> 05:43:24.478 align:start position:0%
are produced by the US by the treasury
 
05:43:27.070 --> 05:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
um including Federal Reserve notes and
 
05:43:29.230 --> 05:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
circulating notes of Federal Reserve
 
05:43:31.150 --> 05:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
Banks and National Banks are legal
 
05:43:34.350 --> 05:43:34.360 align:start position:0%
tender for all debts public charges
 
05:43:35.708 --> 05:43:35.718 align:start position:0%
taxes and
 
05:43:38.628 --> 05:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
dues I guess the question could be is is
 
05:43:42.750 --> 05:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
Wages included in that but looking at
 
05:43:45.230 --> 05:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
the the overall picture of what is
 
05:43:47.670 --> 05:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
included wages would be included because
 
05:43:49.910 --> 05:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
they are required to be
 
05:43:53.468 --> 05:43:53.478 align:start position:0%
paid um so at this point in time the
 
05:43:55.430 --> 05:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
United States does not the federal
 
05:43:57.110 --> 05:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
government does not look at gold and
 
05:43:59.590 --> 05:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
silver except for gold and silver coins
 
05:44:03.350 --> 05:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
that are marked with a valuation and are
 
05:44:06.110 --> 05:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
produced by our treasury uh did the
 
05:44:08.548 --> 05:44:08.558 align:start position:0%
United States does not look at pieces of
 
05:44:12.548 --> 05:44:12.558 align:start position:0%
gold gold leaf um and I did look that up
 
05:44:14.310 --> 05:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
and it is still not accepted as as
 
05:44:16.788 --> 05:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
tender thank you to my Deputy
 
05:44:16.798 --> 05:44:18.590 align:start position:0%
tender thank you to my Deputy
Commissioner

05:44:18.590 --> 05:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioner
 
05:44:20.910 --> 05:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
um that at this point in time it would
 
05:44:22.990 --> 05:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
not be accepted for that so I think that
 
05:44:25.070 --> 05:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
there would be an issue whether or not
 
05:44:27.270 --> 05:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
that issue would come to fruition at the
 
05:44:29.230 --> 05:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
department versus Superior Court I don't
 
05:44:30.948 --> 05:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that
 
05:44:35.990 --> 05:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
question um but I think that as far
 
05:44:40.788 --> 05:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:44.590 --> 05:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
to you would have to you would have to
 
05:44:48.030 --> 05:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
have okay I I I'm not allowed to give my
 
05:44:50.868 --> 05:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
opinion so based upon what I understand
 
05:44:52.390 --> 05:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Labor how it
 
05:44:54.628 --> 05:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
would be interpreted if it is not legal
 
05:44:58.468 --> 05:44:58.478 align:start position:0%
tender it is going to be extremely
 
05:44:58.478 --> 05:44:59.708 align:start position:0%
tender it is going to be extremely
difficult

05:44:59.708 --> 05:44:59.718 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
05:45:03.430 --> 05:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to process claims pay claims
 
05:45:06.750 --> 05:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
order claims to be paid and to enforce
 
05:45:09.430 --> 05:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
the judgments that are handed down and
 
05:45:12.310 --> 05:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
at this point in time it is not legal
 
05:45:15.230 --> 05:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
tender all right thank you other
 
05:45:17.750 --> 05:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
05:45:20.230 --> 05:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
Department representative
 
05:45:23.270 --> 05:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
bani uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:45:25.310 --> 05:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
again M mcra you've had a long day with
 
05:45:29.788 --> 05:45:29.798 align:start position:0%
us um so could we further Define um the
 
05:45:31.468 --> 05:45:31.478 align:start position:0%
cost of gold and silver I know we're
 
05:45:33.390 --> 05:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
talking about legal tender but if this
 
05:45:35.868 --> 05:45:35.878 align:start position:0%
is between an employee and an employer
 
05:45:37.750 --> 05:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
could could there be definitions of okay
 
05:45:40.468 --> 05:45:40.478 align:start position:0%
at Friday um of the pay period at 5:00
 
05:45:42.670 --> 05:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
pm whatever the amount of gold is worth
 
05:45:44.830 --> 05:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
is what you're going to be getting paid
 
05:45:47.628 --> 05:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
could that be part of the restructuring
 
05:45:51.628 --> 05:45:51.638 align:start position:0%
of or if we if you redefined it as e
 
05:45:53.150 --> 05:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
could there be some caveats in there
 
05:45:55.510 --> 05:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
that will further Define the cost of the
 
05:45:57.190 --> 05:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
cost and expectations of the gold
 
05:46:01.548 --> 05:46:01.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:04.230 --> 05:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
we all know that people can contract any
 
05:46:07.390 --> 05:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
way they want to when it comes to the
 
05:46:10.150 --> 05:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
payment of wages though when it comes to
 
05:46:12.070 --> 05:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
the payment of a debt and in this
 
05:46:13.948 --> 05:46:13.958 align:start position:0%
particular case you have an employee who
 
05:46:16.590 --> 05:46:16.600 align:start position:0%
has performed a job and the debt that is
 
05:46:18.868 --> 05:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
owed is by the employer to the employee
 
05:46:21.510 --> 05:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
to pay their earnings it has to be in
 
05:46:21.520 --> 05:46:26.190 align:start position:0%
to pay their earnings it has to be in
legal

05:46:26.190 --> 05:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:28.628 --> 05:46:28.638 align:start position:0%
tender which was kind of my question too
 
05:46:28.638 --> 05:46:29.390 align:start position:0%
tender which was kind of my question too
but

05:46:29.390 --> 05:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:46:32.910 --> 05:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
hiss it a lot simpler than than my bir
 
05:46:35.190 --> 05:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
are there other
 
05:46:37.468 --> 05:46:37.478 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
05:46:39.510 --> 05:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
much for your input and as I said that
 
05:46:42.750 --> 05:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
was the last card that I had um if you
 
05:46:45.788 --> 05:46:45.798 align:start position:0%
could pass that up um we are running a
 
05:46:48.110 --> 05:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
little bit behind my apologies but I
 
05:46:49.830 --> 05:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
think representative McKenzie is going
 
05:46:57.708 --> 05:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:57.718 --> 05:47:00.868 align:start position:0%
 
now

05:47:00.868 --> 05:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:05.510 --> 05:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
so we had one sign in against that bill
 
05:47:08.190 --> 05:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
and then online we had two sign in in
 
05:47:10.430 --> 05:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
support and one in
 
05:47:14.230 --> 05:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
opposition so with that um I would like
 
05:47:14.240 --> 05:47:15.030 align:start position:0%
opposition so with that um I would like
to

05:47:15.030 --> 05:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:47:17.468 --> 05:47:17.478 align:start position:0%
close uh HB
 
05:47:20.868 --> 05:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
1246 and open our final bill of the day
 
05:47:24.910 --> 05:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
HB 1315 and recognize the prime sponsor
 
05:47:27.708 --> 05:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:27.718 --> 05:47:32.590 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

05:47:32.590 --> 05:47:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:35.350 --> 05:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:38.990 --> 05:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
you my name is Mark McKenzie and I'm a
 
05:47:41.510 --> 05:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative from District 40 in
 
05:47:46.150 --> 05:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester and um I this particular
 
05:47:48.468 --> 05:47:48.478 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation I was too late to
 
05:47:50.990 --> 05:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
get it pulled and so it came before this
 
05:47:53.628 --> 05:47:53.638 align:start position:0%
committee as it has to under the rules
 
05:47:56.510 --> 05:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
but I would ask uh that this committee
 
05:48:00.310 --> 05:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
um vote this inexpedient legislate and
 
05:48:02.868 --> 05:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
we send it on the consent calendar down
 
05:48:04.750 --> 05:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
to the floor
 
05:48:07.430 --> 05:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
um so if you if you could do that that'd
 
05:48:09.150 --> 05:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
be fine Mr

bring this
 
05:48:38.750 --> 05:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
up and why do you want to dispose of it
 
05:48:42.190 --> 05:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh there was an issue that uh I had
 
05:48:44.708 --> 05:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
hoped to flush out prior to this uh
 
05:48:48.468 --> 05:48:48.478 align:start position:0%
hearing and I wasn't able to do that and
 
05:48:51.750 --> 05:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
