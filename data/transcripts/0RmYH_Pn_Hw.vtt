independent Rising commission shall be

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of
 
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
election law um for the record my name
 
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 align:start position:0%
is Diane Shu I represent the town of
 
00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 align:start position:0%
Pembrook which is the entire District of
 
00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.110 align:start position:0%
Pembrook which is the entire District of
marac

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
marac
 
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 align:start position:0%
12 um My Little speech here kind of
 
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
tells you that my town is lucky right
 
00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
now because it's the only town that
 
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
compr prises marac 12 however I think
 
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
we're all aware that a lot of towns get
 
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
coupled with other towns through
 
00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
redistricting that they have very little
 
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
in common with and one of the reasons
 
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
that I've been following this process to
 
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
try and get non-bias R districting Done
 
00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
is so that we can overcome that and have
 
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
a little bit more common sense I hope in
 
00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
the districts that we put forward and
 
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
that we all get elected from um that
 
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
concept is what prompted me to introduce
 
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
two previous
 
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
cacs uh cacr 9 in 2019 and 20 which
 
00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
missed reaching the necessary 2third
 
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
vote to pass the house by five votes so
 
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
we came
 
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
close then I introduced a companion bill
 
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
in CA in 2021 cacr 4 which ended up just
 
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
dying in the midst of the
 
00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 align:start position:0%
pandemic um I still do believe however
 
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
that a large majority of the voters
 
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
around the granite state want to see
 
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
Fair nonbiased
 
00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
redistricting that doesn't favor either
 
00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
party uh particularly with the large
 
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
number of Undeclared voters that we have
 
00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
um so that's why I have introduced cacr
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
19 uh to have redistricting done by a
 
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
commission that is as unbiased as
 
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
possible rather than by sitting
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
legislators so I present to you cacr
 
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
19 uh I hope that we can get this done
 
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
to let the voters voices come through
 
00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
let them vote on this if we can pass a
 
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
cacr that's what happens the voters get
 
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
to vote on the
 
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
question um that's about all that I have
 
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
uh if there are any questions I will try
 
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
to answer them I will tell you if there
 
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
are technical questions uh one of my
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors who's a member of your
 
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
committee helped me craft the more
 
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
technical uh setup in the bill and she
 
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
would probably be better uh able to
 
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
answer technical
 
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
questions okay are there questions from
 
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.469 align:start position:0%
questions okay are there questions from
the

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you
 
00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
representative Shu next up is our own
 
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
you um good
 
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
morning uh for the record my name is
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
Connie Lane I'm a representative of
 
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
marac 16 which is conquered ward two um
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
so our as you just heard from
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
representative Shu our existing system
 
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
of redistricting does not not result in
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
districts that fairly represent voters
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
nationally both parties have drawn lines
 
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 align:start position:0%
that favor their own party and have done
 
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
so for decades um both parties are
 
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
guilty of protecting and expanding their
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
power through
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
redistricting and our constituents know
 
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
it and they're not happy about it for
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
anybody who attended the redistricting
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
hearings that we had two years ago you
 
00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
should know that I don't think anyone
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
spoke in favor of the maps that we ended
 
00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 align:start position:0%
up with Jam manderin discourages
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
participation in our constitutional
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
democracy and makes our constituents
 
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
jaded and S and cynical because they
 
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
feel like why vote if the outcome's
 
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
already determined for these reasons we
 
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
need to change our system to make it
 
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
more transparent and less political we
 
00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
may never be able to remove politics
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
totally from redistricting but we
 
00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
certainly owe it to our constituents and
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
our constitutional democracy to try to
 
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
reduce its impact remember that we took
 
00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 align:start position:0%
an oath to represent all of our
 
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 align:start position:0%
constituents not just those who are in
 
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
our party we owe it to all of them to do
 
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
the best job we can to be fair and how
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
we create districts this Constitutional
 
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment establishes an independent
 
00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:23.479 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission to create new
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
districts every 10 years it's similar to
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
the bill that we heard earlier um hb4
 
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
1426 it will help us achieve a fairer
 
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
redistricting process than the one that
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
we have now it's designed so that the
 
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
voters draw the lines not the leaders of
 
00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:43.879 align:start position:0%
our parties the purpose of the
 
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
commission is to make the registering
 
00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:48.759 align:start position:0%
process more transparent because it's
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
done in public and impartial by
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
establishing standards for who can serve
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
on the commission and criteria that must
 
00:07:59.869 --> 00:07:59.879 align:start position:0%
be followed when drawing the maps
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
for those of you who hesitated about the
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
previous redistricting bill because the
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
legislature did not have final authority
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
over the maps this is your solution it
 
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
will change the Constitution that will
 
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
allow the commission to do so it amends
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
it amends the
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution these are the critical
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
factors in the bill the commission is
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
not evenly split between Democrats and
 
00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
Republicans it includes independent
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
members not affiliated with either party
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
this helps prevent deadlock the
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
commission has binding authority to
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
implement the new District Lines
 
00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
independent of the legislature and
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
members of the commission cannot be
 
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
current elected officials so none of us
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
recently retired politicians or
 
00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:49.590 align:start position:0%
recently retired politicians or
political

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
political
 
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
appointees and they are not appointed by
 
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.190 align:start position:0%
appointees and they are not appointed by
political

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:54.200 align:start position:0%
political
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
officials the amendment does not choose
 
00:08:58.829 --> 00:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
commission members as was done in
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
previous bills that have been before the
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
house um they are not chosen by the
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
leadership um they are chosen by judges
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
selected by the Secretary of State while
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
the process seems burdensome it actually
 
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
worked and Colorado which is what the
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
bill is based on um and it accomplishes
 
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
a selection of balanced as non-political
 
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioners as we can get that will
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
draw Fair Maps is it perfect no is it
 
00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
better than what we have now I think so
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
because the selection process dilutes
 
00:09:33.069 --> 00:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
the political
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
incentives there are about 20 states
 
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
with sometime some type of redistricting
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
in place and not all of them have worked
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
smoothly as pointed out recently by
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
chairman Barry when we were in the isec
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
session for hb1
 
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
1426 the redistricting Commission in
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
Michigan violates the voter's Rights Act
 
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
and has been ordered to withdraw the
 
00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
districts around Detroit for those of
 
00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:01.959 align:start position:0%
you familiar with redistricting terms
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
they cracked Detroit in other words they
 
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
sliced it up into multiple districts
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
rather than pack it in which is what
 
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
they had done in the past but before we
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
dismiss the concept of an independent
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
commission based on this one fuxa by the
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
Michigan Commissioners it was their
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
first time doing this remember how many
 
00:10:25.069 --> 00:10:25.079 align:start position:0%
times has have our Maps been challenged
 
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
at Le my in my memory at least for three
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
different decades and how many times
 
00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
have other States maps drawn under
 
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
something similar to what we do have
 
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
been challenged it's innumerable I
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
didn't try to add them all up but it's
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
quite a bit do not be too quick to
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
dismiss a commission simply because it
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
is not perfect our current system is
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
more flawed interestingly though the
 
00:10:51.629 --> 00:10:51.639 align:start position:0%
Michigan commission Drew maps that made
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
for more competitive races across the
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
state and their experience this time
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
around will inform their work in 2031
 
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:01.240 align:start position:0%
now is the time to change our
 
00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:03.639 align:start position:0%
redistricting process none of us know
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
what party might not be either one of
 
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
ours uh will be in power in 2030 so this
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
offers an alternative to both parties to
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
establish a neutral process that
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
benefits our constituents and assures us
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
that the other party will not be drawing
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
lines favoring itself um as an added
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
note I have two sections of the bill
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
that need to be amended um on page one
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
line 26 and and I I'll give this out to
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
people on on page one line 26 the last
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
word should be zero not one and on page
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
eight the last two words on line seven
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
through the first six words on line 10
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
should be deleted and replaced with
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
language that makes it clear that to
 
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
approve a map the commission must have
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
five votes which includes at least one
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
Democrat one Republican and one
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
independent thank you we
 
00:12:01.949 --> 00:12:01.959 align:start position:0%
for questions all right that that
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
question yes representative
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
weing thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
for taking my question good morning good
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
morning um you mentioned that it made
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
the races more competitive is that the
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
goal of the redistricting transparent
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
and more fair yes more
 
00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
competitive that's how they use the term
 
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
in other words they they're no longer
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
strongholds for red or blue they're
 
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
evenly divided by certain criteria that
 
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
they did and that's why they ran into
 
00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
trouble in just in Detroit um
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
so okay thank
 
00:12:41.189 --> 00:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
you representative Raptor um just a
 
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
question would this make it more likely
 
00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
that towns that have sufficient
 
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
population to that are entitled to their
 
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
result further
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
redistricting project I need to start by
 
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
correcting some thisinformation from the
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
executive session on hb1
 
00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:26.839 align:start position:0%
1426 mapathon project is not suing
 
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
anyone instead the cities of do and
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
Rochester after reviewing the New
 
00:13:33.189 --> 00:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house Maps drawn by the mapon
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
team and the underlying supporting data
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
decided after public debate and votes in
 
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
their City councils to bring a case
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
challenging the constitutionality of the
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
maps approved by the legislature and
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor this case is not
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
about partisanship it's strictly about
 
00:13:51.069 --> 00:13:51.079 align:start position:0%
the proper interpretation of a sentence
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
inserted into the New Hampshire
 
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution by 2006 Amendment Dober
 
00:13:58.189 --> 00:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
Rochester found our Maps compelling
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
because they were developed with full
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
transparency the criteria we used was
 
00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
are available on the project
 
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
website during the hb1 1426 executive
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
session we were also criticized for our
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
choice for the Congressional map but
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
actually if you do not like our
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
conclusion you really should critique
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
our transparent criteria and clearly
 
00:14:19.749 --> 00:14:19.759 align:start position:0%
State your own criteria so the public
 
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
can evaluate them both and reach their
 
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.389 align:start position:0%
can evaluate them both and reach their
own

00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
conclusions transparency really is the
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
key people claim that redistricting is
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
inherently a political process
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
but if transparent criteria are agreed
 
00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:33.759 align:start position:0%
upon and are used to evaluate any
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
proposed map then redistricting for
 
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
partisan Advantage can be largely
 
00:14:40.509 --> 00:14:40.519 align:start position:0%
eliminated people say that redistricting
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
Commissions in other states have had
 
00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:43.959 align:start position:0%
disastrous effects because the
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
legislators have ignored and overrode
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
the work of the commission but in New
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire redistricting input and
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
questions from the public are routinely
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
ignored is this not a disaster too
 
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
people say that redistricting must be
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
done by the legislature because it is
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
closest to the people and therefore can
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
be better held accountable for its
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
work but in fact partisan Jerry
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
mandering has largely eliminated any
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
accountability most New Hampshire
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
Representatives do not face any
 
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:15.160 align:start position:0%
challenge in the primary election and
 
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
only token opposition in the general
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
election people also talk about Judges
 
00:15:21.749 --> 00:15:21.759 align:start position:0%
being emboldened to get involved in
 
00:15:23.949 --> 00:15:23.959 align:start position:0%
redistricting but my reading of the
 
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
risting decisions tells me that judges
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
are in fact very reluctant to get
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
involved only do so when the
 
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
redistricting process breaks down
 
00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959 align:start position:0%
usually because of a lack of agreement
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
between the governor and the
 
00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
legislature I think the judges would be
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
very happy if the legislature and the
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
governor could agree on a process that
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
would actually succeed more
 
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
often this is not really a partisan
 
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
issue with the Republicans in the
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
majority right now they are taking
 
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:51.160 align:start position:0%
criticism for their redistricting
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
decisions and for their anticipate
 
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
towards establishing a commission but in
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
2009 and 2010 the Democrats controlled
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
all the levers and they did not enact a
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
commission or any other reform they
 
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
deserve criticism for this failure in
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
addition survey results consistently
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
indicate that solid majorities of Voters
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
of both parties dislike partisan
 
00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering if you doubt these
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
results then put your money where your
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
mouth is and approve crcr 19 and let's
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
see whether the voters really do want
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
reform finally I believe in 50 years
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
people will look back on this time in
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
tense part of ship combined with the
 
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
development of powerful technology to
 
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
enable extreme G gerrymandering and
 
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
wonder why did it take us so long to fix
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
this problem with our democracy why were
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
politicians so entrenched and so
 
00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
reluctant to actually have to compete
 
00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:46.279 align:start position:0%

antrum I support cacr 19 the
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment concurrent
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
resolution to establish an independent
 
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission to draw the
 
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
boundaries for state and federal
 
00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
elections our current process for
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
redistricting resulted in gerrymandered
 
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
maps being drawn after the 2020 census
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
the most notable examples are our New
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Senate maps and the maps for
 
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.190 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Senate maps and the maps for
executive

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
executive
 
00:17:51.789 --> 00:17:51.799 align:start position:0%
councel the this Constitutional
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment removes the drawing of the
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
maps from the legislator and places that
 
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility with an independent
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
commission members of the commission are
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents of two years or
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
more who have not held specified offices
 
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
at the federal or state level for 10 or
 
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.310 align:start position:0%
at the federal or state level for 10 or
more

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
years the process requires public input
 
00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
and support from Democrats Republicans
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
and Undeclared voters there are clear
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines for drawing districts cacr 19
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
will create a more transparent process
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
and eliminate undue political influence
 
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
in the creation of districts elections
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
will be more competitive and it will be
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
the voters who will determine the
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
outcomes rather than the politicians who
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
drew the maps I ask that you vote ought
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
to pass on CAC
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
r19 thank you okay will you be taking
 
00:18:50.909 --> 00:18:50.919 align:start position:0%
questions Miss Bundy no no questions all
 
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
right next up is Liz tanelli from the

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:09.710 align:start position:0%
 
Hampshire

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for this
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity my name is Liz tentarelli
 
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
I'm from Newbury I'm here representing
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
the League of Women Voters of New
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and despite some comments from
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh an earlier executive session we are a
 
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.510 align:start position:0%
uh an earlier executive session we are a
nonpartisan

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
organization we support NE party and
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes to redistricting we know
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
that whichever party is in power is the
 
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
one that will benefit from drawing the
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
maps and we've seen that in other states
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
and it all depends on how strongly you
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
feel about that your chances in
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
2030 your party's chances whether or not
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
you want the legislature to draw the
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
maps or a citizen's commission I'm going
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
to to argue a little differently though
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
I recently was speaking with the leader
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
of common cause in
 
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
Ohio and they have made some legislative
 
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
attempts in recent years to reduce
 
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
partisan gerrymandering and they were
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
not successful because ultimately the
 
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
legislature uh drew the maps they wanted
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
now the citizens of Ohio are gathering
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
400,000 signatures around the state in
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
order to get get a constitutional
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
amendment on their November ballot and
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
they're well on their way to achieving
 
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
that they want to put the power of
 
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
drawing the maps back into the hands of
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
the people through an independent
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
commission now we of course don't allow
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
ballot referenda in New Hampshire and
 
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
for the most part I'm happy about that
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
but you the committee and the
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
legislature have the ability to do the
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
same thing here that is let's support
 
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
for fair Maps be decided by the people
 
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
via the ballot so whether you support an
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
independent redistricting commission
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
with the power to make a decision uh or
 
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
you believe that only the legislators
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
are capable of doing
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
this I don't think that's the issue
 
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
today the issue is whether you have the
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
courage to put that matter before the
 
00:21:27.549 --> 00:21:27.559 align:start position:0%
voters in November and you can do that
 
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
r19 I will take questions if there are
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you thank
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
langle good morning I have with me an
 
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunate amount of paper because my
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
bus is ill so I'm going to pass that
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
around after that way there's not
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
shuffling and I know representative
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
Barry is not the biggest fan of that
 
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
so of course so um I'm gonna take this
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity oh for the record my name is
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
Katherine LEL and I am 20 years old from
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
conquered New Hampshire I'm serving as
 
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
open democracy and open democracy
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
actions public policy fellow and I'm a
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
student currently at St Ansel College um
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
a political Hub and also one of the hubs
 
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
for talking about redistricting and
 
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:33.559 align:start position:0%
learning about it and talking about it
 
00:22:36.669 --> 00:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
in a nonpartisan manner um I'm going to
 
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
take this o opportunity to Echo what
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
many many people behind me said about um
 
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities to represent um your
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
voters and your constituents as opposed
 
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
to just those members of your party um
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
in addition to um let's
 
00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
see yes so the Brennon Center for
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
justice states that done right
 
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
redistricting is a chance to create maps
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
that in the words of John Adams are an
 
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
exact portrait a miniature of the people
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
as a whole so historically New Hampshire
 
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
has called like special committees and
 
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
every 10 years you'll redraw these lines
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
the um and it's Party leaders who have
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
this huge say um an independent
 
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee would ensure
 
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
protections from partisan J
 
00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:26.919 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering efforts um encouraging
 
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire voter
 
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:31.240 align:start position:0%

andette Chappelle and um forgive me I
 
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
wrote it in the back I wasn't even
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
certain I was going to make it to conin
 
00:24:28.269 --> 00:24:28.279 align:start position:0%
today I don't represent any anyone I
 
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
call myself the self-appointed
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
representative of coaz County as a whole
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
um so I support the bill I'm torn
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
between trying to be on the commission
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
or running for Coos 7 which was my
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
original intent because now I can't do
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
both but that's how much this matters to
 
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
me I live in Jefferson which is now part
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
of Co 7 The floal District that attaches
 
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
Jefferson to Berlin through a set of
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
woods we don't we I have to drive 35 to
 
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
40 minutes through two towns to get to
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
it we have zero to do with each other
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
um some Representatives after the maps
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
were drawn and I complained bragged to
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
me that they deliberately gered the map
 
00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:06.200 align:start position:0%
so that Jefferson would be with Berlin
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
because they foolishly believed that the
 
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
conservative town of 1,000 and that's an
 
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
exaggeration because our tourists our
 
00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:15.559 align:start position:0%
vacationers um registered there too um
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
that the town of 1000 would outweigh the
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
88,200 people in Berlin that's not going
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
to happen that doesn't count the
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
prisoners um even with the addition of
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
Whitefield and Twin Mountain to the map
 
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
after that um to the even with the
 
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
addition of Whitefield and Twin Mountain
 
00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:33.799 align:start position:0%
to Jefferson the District of 88,200
 
00:25:35.389 --> 00:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
people in Berlin still outweighed the
 
00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:36.919 align:start position:0%
cumulative voot is in both of those
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
towns Berlin does not have woods so it
 
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't one-third of the city voting on
 
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
COA 7 it was the whole city outweighing
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
those three towns the redistricting
 
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
matters so much to me that I'm actively
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
seeking an apartment in Berlin so I can
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
win the two the Coos 7 seat Jefferson
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
and the small towns matter to me so much
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
that I'm willing to leave it to preserve
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
it also Al I support this bill because
 
00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
I'm seeking representative and Senator
 
00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
support to change that Senate and
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
executive councils be by County instead
 
00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.909 align:start position:0%
executive councils be by County instead
of

00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
apportionment right now Coos County is
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
essentially unrepresented in both our
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
towns Bridges and mountains are used on
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire promotional materials but
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
with the mere nine reps we have because
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
of our small population which I'm happy
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
to maintain that low number the Senators
 
00:26:23.389 --> 00:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
and executive counselors are more
 
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
focused on the more populous Carol and
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
Grafton counties we have very little say
 
00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
in the state house so almost no voice in
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
life okay will you be taking questions
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%

as a way
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%

um thank you for taking my question so
 
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
would there be
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%

of uh certification or affidavit
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%

the in the uh facility um I I don't know
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question what I do
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
see is that on line five persons
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
authorized in this section shall ensure
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
the process of receiving and marking so
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
it's this is just about I think
 
00:29:36.669 --> 00:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
overseeing the
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
bill so let's uh let's not let's not
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%

don't we do this
 
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:02.519 align:start position:0%
already uh I believe in the city of
 
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth we the clerk goes to the
 
00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:08.519 align:start position:0%
various nursing homes maybe we're doing
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
it illegally um that that may be true I
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that in my town we have
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
someone doing this so I was kind of
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
intrigued by this um you know we have we
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
have an elder population and anything we
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
can do to ease the access of voting for
 
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
our elders so that they can vot I think
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
I see it as a good thing okay thank you
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%

um next up we will do uh SL Sloan
 
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
buckton I'm having trouble reading the
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%

00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
buckon and I am the state long-term care
 
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman um thank you for allowing me
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
to speak this morning um I was here last
 
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
year as well on this bill and I'm here
 
00:31:12.629 --> 00:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
again this year to oppose it the
 
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
long-term care on budsman is an older
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
older Americans act program and we
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
represent the rights of individuals who
 
00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:23.559 align:start position:0%
live in long-term care um and the reason
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
that I oppose this is because it it
 
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
seems to place an unne necessary burden
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
on those living in long-term care and
 
00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:34.039 align:start position:0%
also for the municipal voting Personnel
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
to process ballots for those
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
individuals there are several reasons
 
00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:42.519 align:start position:0%
that individuals who reside in um
 
00:31:44.509 --> 00:31:44.519 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities need to be
 
00:31:47.549 --> 00:31:47.559 align:start position:0%
able to request absentee ballots they
 
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
are um related to usually either their
 
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
short-term Rehabilitation and they don't
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
have a way to get to the polling place
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
or unable
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
or they have um ambulation or care needs
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
that make it difficult for them to
 
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
access their polling
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
place so within RSA
 
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
65717 there's
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
already um a process for individuals to
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
request an absentee ballot and to sign
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
the a you know if they need assistance
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
for someone to sign the affidavit that
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
they have assisted them um this language
 
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
seems a little confusing because it
 
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
seems to add an additional burden
 
00:32:34.629 --> 00:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
whereby the town clerk would have to
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
process the absentee ballot and I would
 
00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
remind you all that we have uh 78
 
00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and 143 assisted living
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
facilities in New Hampshire with
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
approximately 14,000
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
residents so I you know I selected one
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
town to highlight which is Dover which
 
00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
has eight assisted living homes homes
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
and three nursing homes with a total of
 
00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
875 residents so I'm not sure how this
 
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
process would work for the town clerk to
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
have to process those absentee ballots
 
00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
when we already have a system in place
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
for individuals to vote by absentee
 
00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
ballot I'm happy to answer any
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
questions um yes representative
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
Burnham thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um are you aware
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
of approximately how many long-term
 
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
residents do request absentee ballots I
 
00:33:37.389 --> 00:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
don't I don't I don't know that we have
 
00:33:37.399 --> 00:33:38.230 align:start position:0%
don't I don't I don't know that we have
any

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
way I will tell you that our office um
 
00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
gets out and reminds facilities every
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
year you know we're we're kind of
 
00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
gearing up now to to talk to facilities
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
to remind them that they may have
 
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
individuals living that in their
 
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
facility that want to vote by absentee
 
00:33:57.389 --> 00:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
ballot so um I think I think it's
 
00:33:59.310 --> 00:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
important that we're increasing their
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
access and not hindering
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
it further questions from the committee
 
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.389 align:start position:0%
it further questions from the committee
representative

00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
quae thank you Mr chairman and and thank
 
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh you
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned long-term care facilities and
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and and just a moment ago
 
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
you also mentioned assisted living
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
facilities our assisting our assisted
 
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
living facilities classified as
 
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
long-term care
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
facilities yes um and this Bill calls
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
for Elder Care Facilities um I I prefer
 
00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:34.839 align:start position:0%
to call them long-term care facilities
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
um being in that age group myself uh I
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
uh yes they would fall under the
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
definition followup please yep follow up
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh and on the same lines uh you said
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
175 uh long-term care facilities would
 
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
that include assisted living facilities
 
00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
in that number there are 78 nursing
 
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
homes and 143 Assisted Living I'm sorry
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
I misremembered and that would include
 
00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
the Assisted Living okay yep thank you
 
00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
very much further questions from the
 
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
committee I'll I'll have I have I'm
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
confused on the objection because the
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
law says it may so it's not
 
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
requirement those language says may
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
deliver not shall so isn't this just
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
allowing another opportunity for vote I
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
think it's confusing
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure I saw that it said May
 
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
um okay well we'll have a I think
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
there's no other question well have
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State scaning can come
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
maybe he can clarify fair enough I did
 
00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
see that but I I'm not sure what the the
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
reason would be for that okay fair
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
enough well I I think I know somebody
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
who might
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
committee all right sing none thank you
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
and next up is Secretary of State
 
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
scanland who uh after his testimony can
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman members
 
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm David scanland
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State I'm here in support
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
of this bill and have worked with
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh on this issue
 
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
for at least a couple of terms now um
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
there was a bill uh that that was taken
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
up it was either last session or the
 
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
session before that uh apparently was
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
deemed to be a little too complicated uh
 
00:36:30.309 --> 00:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
in dealing with this situation and so it
 
00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh uh obviously didn't pass so this is a
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
a kind of a milder version of what was
 
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.109 align:start position:0%
a kind of a milder version of what was
presented

00:36:38.109 --> 00:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
presented
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
before when we're talking about
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
individuals who live in nursing homes or
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
Elder Care Facilities they actually have
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
a choice of where they want to be
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
registered to vote they can either
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
remain registered from the community
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
that they lived in before they went to a
 
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
nursing home or an elder care facility
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
or they can decide to use the location
 
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
of the facility as their domicile uh
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
while they're living there so they have
 
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:12.950 align:start position:0%
while they're living there so they have
a

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
choice that has caused some confusion in
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
the past when the clerks have
 
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
deputized uh uh or given the authority
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
to untrained individuals to go and
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
assist residents of these
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
facilities uh for the opportunity to
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
vote by absentee ballot they might take
 
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
an absentee registration they might take
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
an absentee application for an absentee
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
ballot um and then uh in some cases they
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
actually have the ballots with them and
 
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
can allow assist those voters if
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
necessary uh in in voting the problem
 
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
has come when it is found out after the
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
fact that one of the residents of this
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
facility has voted from the community
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
that they lived
 
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
in uh before they came they filled in an
 
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
application forgot about it and then
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
somebody goes to the facility and they
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
assist them in voting from that location
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
and that has been a problem it's
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunate because that's an illegal
 
00:38:20.109 --> 00:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
situation when that occurs it's double
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
voting but at the same time you know
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
there there are memory issues involved
 
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
and you have to feel sympathetic to that
 
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
concern what this bill does simply is
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
just makes a statement that if a clerk
 
00:38:38.309 --> 00:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
is going to provide the service of going
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
to an elder care facility or a nursing
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
home to allow residents there to vote by
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
absentee that the individuals that are
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
going there are properly trained so
 
00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
they're either the clerk or they are an
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
assistant Clerk or they are a clerk
 
00:38:59.790 --> 00:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
proem and not somebody that's simply
 
00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:03.319 align:start position:0%
deputized maybe a you know a an employee
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
of the facility who may take their their
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
charge uh uh enthusiastically and end up
 
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
getting voters to vote uh innocently who
 
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
should not be uh partaking in that so
 
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
that's all this bill does and I would be
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
happy to try and answer any questions
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
okay uh we'll start off with Vice
 
00:39:24.119 --> 00:39:25.230 align:start position:0%
okay uh we'll start off with Vice
chairman

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
bone thanks Mr chairman thank you taking
 
00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
the question last year I believe we had
 
00:39:34.109 --> 00:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
people testifying that their parent they
 
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
found out that their parents in the
 
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
nursing home had
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
voted yet they don't know how because
 
00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
their parents weren't able to
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
and but somehow or another they got the
 
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot sent in and whatnot by
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
the nursing home would this help to
 
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
prevent that from happening I I believe
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
it would this is designed to just just
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
to help eliminate that
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
confusion further questions
 
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.589 align:start position:0%
confusion further questions
representative

00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
we uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
secretary for taking um my question um
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
so in
 
00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
65717 Roman numeral 2 B and C it already
 
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
addresses residents of nursing homes and
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
Residential Care
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
Facilities should those sections be
 
00:40:27.309 --> 00:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
adjusted with this new proposed
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
RSA I don't believe so representative
 
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
because this is simply addressing who
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
can uh fulfill the role of uh delivering
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
and assisting with the absentee ballots
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the actual process itself
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions from
 
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none thank you
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
secretary scanland thank you next up
 
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
will be uh representative Edwards who
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
shall retroactively introduce the
 
00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:59.349 align:start position:0%
shall retroactively introduce the
bill

00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm sorry I'm late
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
I'm in finance simultaneously I
 
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative kahill
 
00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill um I I wanted to to
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
point out that um this is the second
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
term in which a bill attempting to do
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
something similar uh has been proposed
 
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
uh this one uh feels like it's um more
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
narrowly written um it was drafted by uh
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
key leadership in the um Secretary of
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
State's office so I'm really confident
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
that technically it's a good
 
00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
bill the motivation of this is much like
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
um the vice chair said it came to me
 
00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
about four or five years ago I had
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
constituents in Auburn who were
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely livid uh when they found that
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
their mother uh who was in a nursing
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
home uh who had severe Alzheimer's or
 
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
denture I forget the diagnosis but she
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
was beyond the ability to act under her
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
own competency and they found out that
 
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
uh she had registered and voted and
 
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
voted absentee so this got them curious
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
and they looked at the previous election
 
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
two years earlier when she was also a
 
00:42:16.829 --> 00:42:16.839 align:start position:0%
resident in the same condition at the
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
same nursing home and uh they found that
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
she had been registered and voted under
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
two similar but different names so she
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
cast two ballots in the previous uh
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
election cycle so um so their requests
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
to me and it seemed pretty reasonable
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
was um you know they don't know how the
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
vote was cast but they know that she had
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
very strong political feelings and that
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
they were upset that maybe somebody had
 
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
caused a vote contrary to the way she
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
had lived her life and so this is an
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
attempt uh to prevent a form of of elder
 
00:42:58.990 --> 00:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
abuse I think it's elder abuse to take
 
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's vote from them and cast it
 
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
without them knowing so um I hope I hope
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
you look favorably at this bill it
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't do a lot it just starts to
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
impose a a little bit more guidance on
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
how these nursing home ballots ought to
 
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
be cast I'll take questions if there are
 
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
any okay other questions from the
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative Howard thank
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
question uh so what type of education is
 
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
going to be provided to these long-term
 
00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.549 align:start position:0%
going to be provided to these long-term
living

00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:29.559 align:start position:0%
living
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
facilities how much has been provided in
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
the past or how much would be provided
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
in the future uh provided now to prevent
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh any uh sort of Errors uh like you've
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
been discussing in your testimony if Mr
 
00:43:45.549 --> 00:43:45.559 align:start position:0%
scanland I I'll I'll help I don't think
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
Bill addresses that at all this is about
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
allowing the clerk the assistant Clerk
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
and the clerk protim to deliver absentee
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
ballots uh and receive them in person I
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
don't believe there's any training in
 
00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
fact the argument can be made that
 
00:43:58.829 --> 00:43:58.839 align:start position:0%
there's no training materials actually
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
needed because these are the clerk the
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
assistant Clerk and the clerk protim y
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
um all right further questions thank you
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%

um people there's no other cards oh
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative PR O'Brien yes I'm sorry
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
last one up our own
 
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.390 align:start position:0%
last one up our own
kpo

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for recognizing me Mr
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
chairman I I just want to quickly say
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
that I I support this bill we had a
 
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
similar uh Bill a few years ago uh that
 
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.309 align:start position:0%
similar uh Bill a few years ago uh that
I

00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
sponsored and it was a little different
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
enables the the um ballot Clerk's
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
assistant clerks or clerks proem to
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
deliver the ballots and I think that's a
 
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
good idea and there was a question from
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative Howard about
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
education uh for people at the nursing
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
home I think this one will help a lot it
 
00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:07.640 align:start position:0%
will go a lot uh in in a positive
 
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
direction because I had an experience
 
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
where I was looking for a nursing home
 
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
for my mother-in-law and spoke to a lot
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
of people at nursing homes and this CA
 
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
this came up they the people that are at
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes sometimes feel they
 
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
don't have enough information and
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
education and they would like much more
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
guidance than they get because they want
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
to do a good job and and do everything
 
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
correctly so this would help a lot uh
 
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
and it's not it's not demanding that the
 
00:45:35.549 --> 00:45:35.559 align:start position:0%
clerks do it sometimes there's a
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
situation of the County nursing home
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
being very far away from the town that
 
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
the person comes from and it it can be
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
difficult but uh this will help a lot so
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
um I think that that gives them the
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
option and if the people want their
 
00:45:51.309 --> 00:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
clerks to do this they can discuss that
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
with them uh at at the local level okay
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
questions on the
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'll try seeing none thank you now now
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
we're done okay um got there's uh there
 
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
was three people signed up who didn't
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
speak two in favor
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
one oh I'm sorry nope there two people
 
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
signed up that didn't speak both in
 
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
favor um and then online there was six
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
in support 21 opposed one neutral uh
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
with that I will close the public
 
00:46:24.549 --> 00:46:24.559 align:start position:0%
hearing on uh opposed was
 
00:46:27.069 --> 00:46:27.079 align:start position:0%
21 um with that I'll close the public
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1098 and the
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.800 --> 00:51:55.549 align:start position:0%
 
9:50

00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.069 --> 00:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
okay it's 10:50 so 9:50 excuse me so
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
we're back going to open the public
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
1200 relative to
 
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
controlled and secured storage of
 
00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
printed paper
 
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
ballots um I'll recognize representative
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
Wei for the purpose of introduction of
 
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.109 align:start position:0%
Wei for the purpose of introduction of
the

00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:19.789 --> 00:52:19.799 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chair and honorable
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record my name
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
is Robert warry and I have the privilege
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
of serving in Hillsboro County's 13th
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
District the great town of Hudson which
 
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
is also home to the last high school in
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
the United States having an active dairy
 
00:52:34.789 --> 00:52:34.799 align:start position:0%
farm on
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
campus um all
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
right so um the findings in this bill
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
speak to the high public confidence in
 
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
the Safety and Security of New Hampshire
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
elections because of the use of paper
 
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
ballots therefore efforts should be
 
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:51.640 align:start position:0%
maintained or effort should be made to
 
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
maintain those printed ballots in a
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
secure manner from their creation
 
00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
through their disposal after the proper
 
00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
retention period and this venerable
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
election law committee has also heard
 
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
about the already wellestablished
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
controls for counting the ballots and
 
00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
most of the committee has witnessed the
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
diligent verification process that
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
moderators go through to ensure an
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
accurate count of ballots uh received at
 
00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
the various towns and City Wards the
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
committee also heard in last week's
 
00:53:22.829 --> 00:53:22.839 align:start position:0%
testimony on HP
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
1134 that an unknown quantity of over
 
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
overrun ballots are necessarily
 
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
generated by the very nature of the
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
printing and cutting process and an
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
accurate count of overrun ballots
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
retained at the printers is not
 
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
currently required so um various
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
Industries already use controls for the
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
secured storage of printed materials for
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
the Safety and Security of their product
 
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:48.839 align:start position:0%
the implementation of additional
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
controls uh for the storage of printed
 
00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
election ballot shouldn't be an arduous
 
00:53:58.750 --> 00:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
or agre just uh task and request there
 
00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
um and it should uh continue to bolster
 
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
the public confidence and the Safety and
 
00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
Security of New Hampshire elections just
 
00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
to briefly outline the bill section one
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
pertains to a controlled and secured
 
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
area as report by secretary scanland
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
this already exists and therefore this
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
merely codifies current practice section
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
two uh pertains to authorized access it
 
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
probably does need an amendment uh
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
somehow um it was restricted two
 
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
employees I don't think that was the
 
00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:29.319 align:start position:0%
original intent when I wrote it but uh I
 
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
I missed that in the review of that so
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
my bad um section three pertains to a
 
00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
record of authorized access as granted
 
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
under section two section four pertains
 
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
to an inventory of all ballots and the
 
00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
handling of ballots spoiled at the
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
printer section five pertains to
 
00:54:47.789 --> 00:54:47.799 align:start position:0%
maintaining the security of the printed
 
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
ballots section six pertains to
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
maintaining an inventory after Printing
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
and distribution and section seven is
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
the transfer of the printed printing
 
00:54:59.309 --> 00:54:59.319 align:start position:0%
records being transferred to the
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office as a record
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
for an extended period of time following
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
the election Section 8 creates a
 
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
requirement for a video surveillance as
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
a record of the maintained security for
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
the facility surveillance cameras are
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
not prohibitively expensive a single
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
installation of a camera is in the range
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
of $3,000 so if you estimate such
 
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
installations at a printer it might be a
 
00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
baseline cost of
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
15,000 which is probably not that much
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
in the overall scheme of ballot printing
 
00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
costs some costs would be in incurred
 
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
for ongoing maintenance but these would
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
be a fraction of the estimated startup
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
cost so as I said before I think an
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
amendment is of section two in
 
00:55:51.069 --> 00:55:51.079 align:start position:0%
particular is necessary um but uh th
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
those end my introductory comments here
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take question questions the
 
00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative weie um next up will be
 
00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
Hennessy good morning ER everyone Aaron
 
00:56:22.829 --> 00:56:22.839 align:start position:0%
Hennessy deputy secretary of state um I
 
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
just want to reiterate uh secretary
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
scan's invitation that he gave to your
 
00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:29.559 align:start position:0%
this committee last week to come and
 
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
visit our the printing process um at the
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
printer and um with with the
 
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
accompaniment of our office of course um
 
00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
so that you can see for yourself um the
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
Safety and Security that our office um
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
takes to ensure that our ballots are
 
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
fully secure the entire time from the
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
purchase of the paper through to the
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
printing of the ballots through to the
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
shipping of the ballots
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
through to the record retention of all
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
election materials for uh the required
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
legal time period after the
 
00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:05.710 align:start position:0%
legal time period after the
election

00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
um as secretary scanland pointed
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
testified to last week we take the
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
security very seriously um we use a
 
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
secured facility um that is um takes the
 
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
security of the materials that they have
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
in their possession uh very serious ly
 
00:57:27.789 --> 00:57:27.799 align:start position:0%
uh we do have some concerns with some of
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill that is
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
written um some of it has to do with the
 
00:57:35.789 --> 00:57:35.799 align:start position:0%
actual printing process um for example
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
when paper is printed on um the ink has
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
to cure on that actual paper and that
 
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
takes time sometimes depending on the
 
00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
humidity or atmospheric conditions in
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
the room um it can be a shorter amount
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
of time sometimes it could take up to 24
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
hours so when that happens that material
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
is secure on the printing floor of the
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
facility um and I'm happy to show you
 
00:58:02.029 --> 00:58:02.039 align:start position:0%
this again if um you'd like to come and
 
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
take a tour so some of the language in
 
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
here um kind of micromanages the process
 
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
our office believes that we do have a
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
secure process that the materials are
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
under um are very secure the entire time
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
from when we deliver the print the blank
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
materials to the office to when we um
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
ship all of the ballots out to when we
 
00:58:28.349 --> 00:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
ask the printer to destroy all of the
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
election materials uh this bill also
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
calls for um I forget the language it
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
uses but somewhat immediate destruction
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
of materials that were um printed
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
incorrectly in the printing process the
 
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
printer needs to warm up so for each
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
batch that goes through there's going to
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
be some light Printing and our um our
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
office has always taken the stance that
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
we do not want those materials destroyed
 
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
and recycled until after after the
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
election um just in case someone were to
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
come across a batch of
 
00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:02.559 align:start position:0%
shredded uh ballots um before the
 
00:59:05.029 --> 00:59:05.039 align:start position:0%
election happens there might be some um
 
00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:07.240 align:start position:0%
questions that come up publicly so we
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
would like to maintain all of that uh
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
those materials within the secure
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
printer until after the election is over
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I think that's all the comments I
 
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
have on this bill I'm happy to take
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
questions okay uh questions from the
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
committee representative wood
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you deputy
 
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
secretary um I think you started
 
00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
answering my questions there are some
 
00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:33.640 align:start position:0%
things in here that you feel are
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
excessive uh you said micromanage but
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
yes micromanage thank you yeah but um I
 
00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to put words in your mouth
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
are there pieces in here that you
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
codified thank you for the question
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
um I would have to get you the exact
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
pieces that I wouldn't get would would
 
00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
not like to see codified but anything
 
00:59:56.349 --> 00:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
around the curing of the ballots and
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
where they can be located um anything
 
01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
that would require 24-hour um person to
 
01:00:05.029 --> 01:00:05.039 align:start position:0%
be watching those ballots as they cure
 
01:00:09.029 --> 01:00:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
the additional language as to um the
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
shredding of the materials or um
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
destruction of the materials and when
 
01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
that occur occurs um as I said I think
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
that our office does a a great job right
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
now ensuring the security of our ballots
 
01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not quite sure that this
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
language is
 
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
necessary yep follow thank you for
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
answer I what about the video
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
surveillance what's your thoughts on
 
01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
that I would have to talk to the vendor
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
I believe that they may already have
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
external video surveillance but I'm not
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
positive that of that we've never asked
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
to see it um because when none of the
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
materials leave the building unless they
 
01:00:58.510 --> 01:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
are shipped by our employees um but as
 
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
far as putting video surveillance in a
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
private company um that might be an
 
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
issue for a private um employer in the
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
state that would be right to
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
knowable for questions from the
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
committee representative Lane um in the
 
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
kind of opposite thank you Mr chair and
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question kind of
 
01:01:20.829 --> 01:01:20.839 align:start position:0%
the flip side of what you would want
 
01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
eliminated this is very strictly out
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
line so I'm thinking when in two two to
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
what happens in two to three years when
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
maybe something new to provide security
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
that your office wants to do would it
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
then be prohibited by this narrow the
 
01:01:39.789 --> 01:01:39.799 align:start position:0%
more narrow language it's kind of the
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
flip side yeah thank you for that
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
question um and as a lawyer I'm sure
 
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
that you you can write that much better
 
01:01:49.029 --> 01:01:49.039 align:start position:0%
than I can in Statue but there may be
 
01:01:50.589 --> 01:01:50.599 align:start position:0%
some issues for that so thank you for
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
bringing that up I appreciate that
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
further questions seeing none thank you
 
01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary um I don't believe I
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
have any other pink cards in my
 
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
possession unless I'm missing some
 
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
representan did I miss you hold on no
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
he's not on he's on another bill okay
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
himan we're on House Bill 1200 are you
 
01:02:15.069 --> 01:02:15.079 align:start position:0%

um can I get the blue sheet please and
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%

01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:25.720 align:start position:0%
turned f
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
after uh we're not going to be hearing
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%

01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%

if I correct your card to 12200 you
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak to
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
1569 15 not yet yeah that's not coming
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
up until much later anyways okay you
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
recognized representative organ thank
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
you I'm representing Timothy Oregon from
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
straford County District 10 which is the
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
town of Durham um also of course famous
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
for being the home of the University of
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and um so I just uh want
 
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
to very quickly say I think this bill is
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um I agree with what deputy
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
secretary Hennessy said that they
 
01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
already have uh sufficient controls over
 
01:03:14.029 --> 01:03:14.039 align:start position:0%
this process I know I mean I know it's
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
no fun losing an election I've actually
 
01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
personally never lost an election not
 
01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
yet I did have one that um ended up
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
winning a recount by four votes so you
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
do always wonder how how could that
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
happen and one of the ways you think is
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
like oh were there a bunch of like
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
fraudulent ballots somehow snuck into
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
the process um so I understand where
 
01:03:36.269 --> 01:03:36.279 align:start position:0%
people are coming from but I think
 
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
there's sufficient controls and if for
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
some reason somebody
 
01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
did what steal a bunch of ballots and
 
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
like or fraudulently print up their own
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
ballots or whatever um I think that
 
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
would be caught because uh we track
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
everybody who comes into the polling
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
place and then we track the number of
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
ballots that uh that go through the
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
ballot box or those are done as right
 
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
and site I'm not sure what this adds to
 
01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
the process um also I also like to use
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
one of our favorite Expressions around
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
here unfunded mandate so this is an
 
01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate I mean it does have a
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal note but the fiscal note doesn't
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
say who's going to pay for it or how or
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
how much it's going to cost it's going
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
to be a significant amount of money and
 
01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:26.839 align:start position:0%
um and also it doesn't account for uh
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
so-called uocava ballots which are
 
01:04:32.829 --> 01:04:32.839 align:start position:0%
people who live overseas but can still
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
vote in federal elections I guess you
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
all I don't know why I'm telling you
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
guys this you're the subject matter
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
experts but doesn't account for the U
 
01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
coma ballots also I see some U several
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
guide dogs in the humans um there is
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
a the polling places have uh those um
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
handicapped uh handicapped uh voting
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
stations which B basically um you um
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
would basically print up a ballot for a
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
person who's unable to read or fill out
 
01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
a you know a standard ballot so it
 
01:05:05.309 --> 01:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about those either
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
so I I just think uh I think this I
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
think this bill is unnecessary I think
 
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
you know we already count what goes we
 
01:05:16.349 --> 01:05:16.359 align:start position:0%
already like have exact count of who
 
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
shows up at the polling place or um
 
01:05:22.589 --> 01:05:22.599 align:start position:0%
request an absente ballot we account we
 
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
account for everybody who sends in an
 
01:05:26.029 --> 01:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
ballot and we account for all the
 
01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:27.559 align:start position:0%
ballots that go through the counting
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
process so I think this just creates
 
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
more suspicion and more expense and uh
 
01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
so I think we should trust the Secretary
 
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
of State's office which does an
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
excellent job of overseeing Elections to
 
01:05:41.549 --> 01:05:41.559 align:start position:0%
continue to do this so this is uh so
 
01:05:43.269 --> 01:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
dist the phrase unfunded mandate I guess
 
01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
I'll also go ahead and use another
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
favorite expression we hear at the State
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
House a solution in search of a problem
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
so I would just say it's bills uh so I
 
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
think this Bill uh should be in
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate so thanks okay we
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee sure
 
01:06:02.109 --> 01:06:02.119 align:start position:0%
whether I can answer them or not I don't
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
know but yes seeing seeing none thank
 
01:06:06.269 --> 01:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
you and I don't have anyone else to
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
speak after that um there were two
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
people on the blue sheet that did not
 
01:06:12.029 --> 01:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
speak both signed up against online
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
there were 12 in support and 16 in
 
01:06:17.549 --> 01:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
opposition with that I'll be closing the
 
01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing for House Bill 1200 the
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
committee will stand in recess until
 
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:52.990 align:start position:0%
committee will stand in recess until
1015

01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.000 --> 01:16:42.709 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.629 --> 01:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
okay it is 10:15 I'm going to open the
 
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:49.400 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill
 
01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
1264 um we have quite a few number of
 
01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
people signed up to speak speak on this
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
bill um so for the many of them are new
 
01:16:58.629 --> 01:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
to the election law committee so what I
 
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
do in these situations is I always have
 
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
an order in which I go so the first
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
thing is I let the state reps go first
 
01:17:06.510 --> 01:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
the sponsor obviously goes first then I
 
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
usually let the Secretary of State go
 
01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
first or any other um person here from a
 
01:17:13.149 --> 01:17:13.159 align:start position:0%
department um and then I always as I say
 
01:17:14.590 --> 01:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
I make the lobbyist go last because they
 
01:17:18.270 --> 01:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
get paid to be here um so the way what
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do is the state reps that
 
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
are signed up to speak and the uh
 
01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office and members
 
01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
of the general public uh you will go
 
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
first and you will not have a time limit
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
um because there are nearly 10 lobbyists
 
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak of this my lobbyists
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
are going to be limited to two minutes
 
01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
each um because I imagine much of it
 
01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
will be duplicative um but the people
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
that are not paid to be here that came
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
here on their own time I want to respect
 
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
you um and give you as much time as you
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
wish so with that um I'm going to I
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
believe uh representative Paige are you
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
going to introduce the bill all right
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative page is recognized for
 
01:17:51.149 --> 01:17:51.159 align:start position:0%
the purpose of introduction of House
 
01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 1260 four thank you Mr chair and
 
01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee sorry
 
01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
let me read the title real fast I
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
apologize House Bill 1264 FN relative to
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
the definition of accessible voting
 
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
systems I apologize represent thank you
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you uh Mr chair and thanks
 
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um I guess in
 
01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.030 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um I guess in
an

01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
unusual move for a political person I
 
01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
will try to be
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
brief so I will keep it as this is a
 
01:18:21.149 --> 01:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
pretty simple bill um in essence it
 
01:18:23.709 --> 01:18:23.719 align:start position:0%
requires that uh well let me back up
 
01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
under the current situation with voting
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
in our state um people who have visual
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
impairments or print disabilities uh
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
have the use of assistive technology
 
01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
which is really a lowcost low Tech uh
 
01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
device it's basically a tablet that's
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
got headphones connected to a printer
 
01:18:43.629 --> 01:18:43.639 align:start position:0%
and you may have seen these in the
 
01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
polling places um but you would only see
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
them in state and federal elections you
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
would not generally see them but for two
 
01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
towns in Municipal elections so so when
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
I told reps this um this sort of a heads
 
01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
scratch uh why is it that we don't have
 
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
them for Municipal elections um and for
 
01:19:04.629 --> 01:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
those of you who did the uh there's a
 
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
future in sight uh Randy Pierce is here
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
who did a a lunch for the Reps in the
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
cafeteria he had a a machine that
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
demonstrates this and other folks will
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
talk about that but basically what this
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
bill attempts to resolve is that issue
 
01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
where people who are visually impaired
 
01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
or have print disabilities do not have
 
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
use of this lowcost low tech technology
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
for Municipal elections and I know
 
01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
everyone on this committee and everyone
 
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
in this body uh takes quite seriously
 
01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
the secrecy of the ballot uh that is
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
fundamental to our right and we don't
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
need to go in and on about that so what
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
this bill does is it resolves that and
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
it requires that those devices be
 
01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
available uh for municiple
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
elections and I think that aligns us
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
with our constitutional obligation under
 
01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
state constitution and aligns us um also
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
puts us in line with federal disability
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
law the
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
Ada um requires this and Conquer for
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
example is under a consent decree or a
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement with the Department
 
01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
of Justice because they were under the
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
threat of a lawsuit because they weren't
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
providing this they do now exiter
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
voluntarily does it but to my knowledge
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
those are the only two that provide
 
01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
these devices who can people will talk
 
01:20:20.830 --> 01:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
more about what that looks like what
 
01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
those devices are about uh behind me
 
01:20:27.669 --> 01:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
but so so not only do we protect the
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
secrecy and privacy and Independence of
 
01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
someone being able to cast their
 
01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
ballot by using the machines in
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections we would be avoiding
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
some unfortunate situation for a
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
municipality who's going to be sued
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
under the Ada and ultimately be required
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
to have to use these machines in any
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
event these are lowcost machines you
 
01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
know anywhere from 1700 to 2500 I've
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
seen I'll let others testify to that um
 
01:20:55.709 --> 01:20:55.719 align:start position:0%
then they're programmed um they are
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
provided right now by the Secretary of
 
01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
State's office for state and federal
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
elections but again um they're not in
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
the Municipal elections so this bill
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
would would Rectify that
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
um I I I think that's that's in essence
 
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
what this would do I I I it's pretty
 
01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
simple but it's pretty important I think
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
we could all agree
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
that the current situation in a
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
municipal election where someone has to
 
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
tell someone who they're voting for and
 
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
rely on that person to fill the right
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
oval or whatever it is even if it's your
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
best friend or or you're the clerk
 
01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
there's something wrong about that and
 
01:21:35.950 --> 01:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
this bill would solve that problem so
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions there's a
 
01:21:39.790 --> 01:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
line of folks that are far more informed
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
than I am on this but yeah other
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you Mr chair
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh under the way that this uh
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
legislation is written it states that
 
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
every city and every town which has
 
01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
adopted an official ballot system as
 
01:22:00.510 --> 01:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
provided in RSA 6692 or RSA
 
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
66913 uh does that mean that in towns
 
01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
that have not adopted uh an accessible
 
01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh ballot system uh that they wouldn't
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
be subject to this
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
legislation well my understanding is
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
that every town and municipality would
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
be subject to it in terms of the um
 
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
alignment with the statutory framework
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
to ensure that um you know I I think
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
that that's the intent um the Secretary
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
of I did have a brief conversation with
 
01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office about um
 
01:22:31.390 --> 01:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
some statutory alignment which seems to
 
01:22:33.629 --> 01:22:33.639 align:start position:0%
be to to make sure that this would also
 
01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
be applicable for uh uh School U
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
elections and things like that so that
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
seemed like a minor and I I'm not
 
01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
speaking for him and I I think deput
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State Hennessy is going to
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
testify but something that can be
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
cleaned up with an amendment um all this
 
01:22:50.189 --> 01:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
bill does is just take what we're doing
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
at the state and federal level with the
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
machines at the secretary States has now
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
and and requires municipalities to do
 
01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
the same okay thank you further
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none n I'm sorry
 
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
representative qu I missed you thank you
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and and thank you
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative uh um first of all I
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree on the importance of
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
the secret ballot it's one of our
 
01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
fundamental requirements no question
 
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
about that but I have kind of a detailed
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
question on page two line
 
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
10 talks about uh accessible voting
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
system that enables all individuals with
 
01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities to vote without the Need
 
01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.030 align:start position:0%
disabilities to vote without the Need
For

01:23:30.030 --> 01:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
For
 
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
assistance uh how do we ensure that
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
there people with varying levels of
 
01:23:36.669 --> 01:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
disability of course and they all
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
deserve cons the ability to do that
 
01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
but depositing you know conveying the
 
01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
ballot to the The Ballot Box or the vote
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
accounting machine is part of voting and
 
01:23:54.189 --> 01:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
so would this prohibit some someone from
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
assisting a voter who Maybe Can't convey
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
that ballot on their own to The Ballot
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
Box would it help would it prohibit
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
someone from you know an official from
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
conveying the ballot for them thank you
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
sure I mean I'm I mean I'm not sure that
 
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
we could game out every scenario but I
 
01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question first of all
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
01:24:18.990 --> 01:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
um you know I think um the intent at
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
least with respect to this law this bill
 
01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
would simp simply be within the context
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
of using the assisted technology machine
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
to ensure that there's privacy in terms
 
01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
of conveyance of the ballot to the
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
machine is that like you know I'm
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
walking to the machine with it um well I
 
01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
I would presume that under the Ada some
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
if that would be a reasonable
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
accommodation to to help someone that
 
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
would probably be permitted um I I can
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
tell you that uh you know I use the
 
01:24:48.270 --> 01:24:48.280 align:start position:0%
machine in the most recent
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
primary and it it's terrific it just it
 
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
is the ballot it prints it out and I you
 
01:24:56.189 --> 01:24:56.199 align:start position:0%
know put it into the ballot machine just
 
01:24:59.109 --> 01:24:59.119 align:start position:0%
like uh as I've been behind the without
 
01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
assistance so um one one thing I do want
 
01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
to make mention of real quick is and
 
01:25:05.709 --> 01:25:05.719 align:start position:0%
this is unrelated so I is that the new
 
01:25:07.149 --> 01:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
new uh New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
associations are open to they're they're
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
this is a bipartisan Bill uh right and
 
01:25:13.950 --> 01:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
and it's also got the support of the
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
municipal Association among many others
 
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
um and they're open to um footing some
 
01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill in terms of the programming
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
costs on this which you which because it
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
goes to the the vendor and they make
 
01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
sure it's you know in line with what you
 
01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:29.719 align:start position:0%
wanted on your ballot
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
Lane uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%
um why does from your understanding why
 
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
does the Secretary of State not provide
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
them for Municipal
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
elections and I may have a follow
 
01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
up yeah I I will ask the same question
 
01:25:53.790 --> 01:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
of the Secretary of State
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so I certainly they can speak for
 
01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
that I can say that I've had meetings
 
01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
with the Secretary of State as as the
 
01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
interest groups that are involved in
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
this have as well and so I'll just speak
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
from my perspective about their
 
01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
perspective and that I think is there
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
seems to be some um hesitation with
 
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
respect to uh Manpower if you will uh
 
01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
being able to turn around some of the
 
01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:20.719 align:start position:0%
machines between um like the primary in
 
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
January and a municipal election March
 
01:26:26.109 --> 01:26:26.119 align:start position:0%
do they have the staff to reprogram wipe
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
the machines clean from the last
 
01:26:30.109 --> 01:26:30.119 align:start position:0%
election reprogram and then send them
 
01:26:33.310 --> 01:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
out I I think the good news on that is a
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
we have the machines um the number of uh
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
towns that would have a pro you know be
 
01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
jamming up that kind of pack schedule
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
would be limited because they basically
 
01:26:46.590 --> 01:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
be S SP2 towns right from let's say we
 
01:26:48.189 --> 01:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
have the January primary then my exitor
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
is sb2 we have a March ballot um so
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
that's a limited un so I'd like to think
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
that somewhere in sort of our New
 
01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:57.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire efficiency
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
model we could figure out a way to to do
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
that to to be able to Not Duplicate
 
01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:04.870 align:start position:0%
that to to be able to Not Duplicate
machine

01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
machine
 
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
purchasing I haven't quite figured that
 
01:27:08.910 --> 01:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
out but the wisdom of the committee
 
01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:10.750 align:start position:0%
out but the wisdom of the committee
might

01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
Brennan she does
 
01:27:18.109 --> 01:27:18.119 align:start position:0%
not thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
question are you aware of vendors who
 
01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:25.719 align:start position:0%
may be able to do the reprogramming of
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
these devices um to kind of take that
 
01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
off of the Secretary of State's plate
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
and allow municipalities to contract
 
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
with vendors who might be able to you
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
know take this on in that short
 
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
turnaround time frame that's a really
 
01:27:43.229 --> 01:27:43.239 align:start position:0%
good question and my understanding is
 
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
that yes there are vendors that do this
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
for I think for a living if you will
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
that's their function among many other
 
01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
things but yeah I think that there's a a
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
well-oiled machine that knows how to
 
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
program these things and I think that's
 
01:27:59.709 --> 01:27:59.719 align:start position:0%
if I all states I think but for us in
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
Hawaii provide this technology in
 
01:28:04.510 --> 01:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections so there's a
 
01:28:06.669 --> 01:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
Marketplace and a vendor that that can
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
do this stuff and they do it and they
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
currently do it for us I think it's my
 
01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
understanding further questions from the
 
01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:15.639 align:start position:0%
committee representative wey thank you
 
01:28:17.070 --> 01:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question my wife taught
 
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
for many years at Perkin School for the
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
Blind down and water and so uh this is
 
01:28:28.109 --> 01:28:28.119 align:start position:0%
near and dear to my heart I'm I'm just
 
01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm concerned that uh you
 
01:28:33.550 --> 01:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it's more targeted toward
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
the visually impaired and I'm I'm
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
concerned that it enables all in in page
 
01:28:42.109 --> 01:28:42.119 align:start position:0%
two line 10 enables all individuals with
 
01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities I'm wondering if that's too
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
broad a scope um and and if it might you
 
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
know o open up municipal alties to
 
01:28:56.229 --> 01:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
additional lawsuits because we haven't
 
01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
provided for every
 
01:29:00.270 --> 01:29:00.280 align:start position:0%
disability so that's a good question and
 
01:29:02.109 --> 01:29:02.119 align:start position:0%
we have a graduate of the Perkin School
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
of the blind who's a constituent of mine
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
who's the driver behind this bill jeene
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
Shiner called me up and said we got to
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
do this and I said okay Jean just listen
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
to Jean uh but to your question um you
 
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
know I think that and I'm going to let
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
the disability rights Community speak to
 
01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
this because I am by no means an expert
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
in this I don't think that by expanding
 
01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
this to and it's not necessarily just uh
 
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
they know the universe of folks that
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
would be able to use this this
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
particular technology not just my
 
01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
limited knowledge of telling you I think
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
the the reduction of a lawsuit is
 
01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
happens by by by doing this not an
 
01:29:43.510 --> 01:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
increase in terms of um probability of
 
01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:45.070 align:start position:0%
increase in terms of um probability of
that

01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:49.229 --> 01:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Brennan thank you um
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
do you know if clerks or election
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
officials have some kind of test that a
 
01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
voter with a disability would need to um
 
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
fill out or complete in order to use
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
these devices or are they available to
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
any voter that requests access to the
 
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
one for all um devices yeah I'll try to
 
01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
answer that the best I can and that is
 
01:30:22.669 --> 01:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
they are available to any voter as my
 
01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
understand that would request them yeah
 
01:30:26.350 --> 01:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
and in fact as I mentioned I used it in
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
March my clerk took me over to the spot
 
01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
and did it so further questions seeing
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
none thank you representative Paige
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh next up
 
01:30:36.639 --> 01:30:47.790 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh next up
representative

01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
Lynn uh thank you Mr chair members of
 
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Bob Lynn I'm a
 
01:30:54.669 --> 01:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
representative from uh Windam Rockingham
 
01:30:57.950 --> 01:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
District 17 and I appear um in support
 
01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
of uh this bill um I don't really have a
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
lot to add to what representative Paige
 
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
said the only point that I I think I
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
would make and which I think is really
 
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
important is and I and I'm sure the
 
01:31:12.910 --> 01:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State um will expand upon
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
this but it's my understanding that um
 
01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
in the main uh the the machines that are
 
01:31:24.109 --> 01:31:24.119 align:start position:0%
that would needed for this are already
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
in existence and the only question is
 
01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
should those machines be able to be used
 
01:31:30.990 --> 01:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
for local elections in addition to State
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
elections and um as as was pointed out
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
um voting is pretty pretty darn
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
important and it seems to me that it's
 
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh that um the you know the balance
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
there tips in favor of yes they should
 
01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
be available for for local elections so
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
that that's really uh the Su substance
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
of my testimony I'm happy to answer any
 
01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
questions if uh people have it represent
 
01:31:57.550 --> 01:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you and thank you for taking
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
my question um it's I'm glad to see you
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
co-sponsoring this bill representative
 
01:32:06.669 --> 01:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
Lynn thank you for that I'm wondering if
 
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
it is your testimony that every eligible
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
voter deserves the opportunity to cast
 
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
their ballot and have that ballot
 
01:32:18.270 --> 01:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
counted every every eligible voter who
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
meets the requirements of the law yes I
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
do I do agree with that see what you did
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
there representative Howard thank you Mr
 
01:32:27.149 --> 01:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
question uh so under the you might not
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily know but under the fiscal
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
note for this bill it labels everything
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
as a local expenditure uh because of
 
01:32:38.109 --> 01:32:38.119 align:start position:0%
your testimony do you believe that this
 
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:39.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be something covered by the
 
01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
Secretary of
 
01:32:43.229 --> 01:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
State well I guess I'd want to you know
 
01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
I'd want to hear what the secretary of
 
01:32:47.709 --> 01:32:47.719 align:start position:0%
state has to say about this I mean I if
 
01:32:50.669 --> 01:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
it's if the machines are available and
 
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:32:54.990 --> 01:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
you know a huge deal so to speak to have
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
the to have them simply kind of
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
reprogram for local elections I would uh
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
you know may maybe that is something
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
that the that the state should pick up
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
or maybe that's something that you know
 
01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
um the mun the municipal Association
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
would have something to say about about
 
01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
how that Arrangement should be should be
 
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
worked out okay thank
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%

01:33:21.149 --> 01:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you
 
01:33:23.790 --> 01:33:23.800 align:start position:0%

01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%

Hennessy good morning Aaron Hennessy
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
state sorry uh I just want to let you
 
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
know our office does support the use of
 
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
these devices in local elections um
 
01:33:50.669 --> 01:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
there's some semantics that I just want
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
to walk you through um so I personally
 
01:33:57.790 --> 01:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
had several meetings um with the sponsor
 
01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
of this bill starting in the fall to try
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
and work out how this bill could work
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
for um for local elections and with the
 
01:34:07.229 --> 01:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
assistance of our office so I just want
 
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
to give you a little background on what
 
01:34:13.470 --> 01:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
the current um equipment that we use as
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
as a state for accessible
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
voting uh we have a programmed tablet
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
and it's it's like a a flat tablet
 
01:34:26.229 --> 01:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
that we um clean like the hard drive um
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
after every election and then when we
 
01:34:31.470 --> 01:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
receive the programmed ballot for each
 
01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
of the polling locations currently
 
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
there's 208 um we physically um program
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
that each individual tablet for that
 
01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
polling location's ballot um and test
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
the programming of the ballot in our
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
office um then we package that tablet up
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
um and we send it to each of the local
 
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
election officials um they are required
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
to um test that at their before
 
01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
implementing that into their local into
 
01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
their state voting um at their polling
 
01:35:09.149 --> 01:35:09.159 align:start position:0%
locations as well um the what goes along
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
with the tablet is a tent a privacy tent
 
01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
you may have seen this at your local
 
01:35:16.750 --> 01:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
polling locations it's a large white
 
01:35:20.669 --> 01:35:20.679 align:start position:0%
tent um in within the tent is a docking
 
01:35:22.030 --> 01:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
station for the tent tablet that
 
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
connects the tablet to a printer and
 
01:35:26.669 --> 01:35:26.679 align:start position:0%
other accessible voting equipment
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
including a
 
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
keyboard um and in discussions with the
 
01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill we think that is um
 
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
we would be very happy to share this
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
equipment which is already maintained by
 
01:35:41.070 --> 01:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
the local election officials the city
 
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
city or town clerk keeps the tent they
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
keep the T they keep the docking station
 
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
they keep the printer um unless we
 
01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
upgrade the equipment um they maintain
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
that at their in um secured securely
 
01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
storage in their um local offices um
 
01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
what it comes down to for our office is
 
01:36:02.669 --> 01:36:02.679 align:start position:0%
the logistics of getting the tablets
 
01:36:06.189 --> 01:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
back and wiping them clean I'm not just
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
wiping them down just wiping the hard
 
01:36:09.550 --> 01:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
times CLE so that we can make sure
 
01:36:11.229 --> 01:36:11.239 align:start position:0%
there's no viruses or anything that were
 
01:36:13.229 --> 01:36:13.239 align:start position:0%
entered into at the polling location
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
somehow um and that the um the next
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
election can be programmed for that um
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
there does take some time for our office
 
01:36:24.510 --> 01:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
to get them back and to do that and time
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
is money sometimes so if we were to
 
01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
share our devices with local election
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
officials this is something I think we
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
can do but it just takes it takes
 
01:36:37.470 --> 01:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
Manpower and it takes um time to do this
 
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
which we don't currently have um as you
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
know our office doesn't just do
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
elections we have a dedicated it team
 
01:36:47.470 --> 01:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
that is to our entire um office not just
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
our elections division um so they have
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
other duties as well
 
01:36:55.950 --> 01:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
um what the if we were to share our
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
tablets we would need additional tablets
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
um because of the timing and turnover of
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
the tablets um and sometimes after a
 
01:37:08.229 --> 01:37:08.239 align:start position:0%
state election a local um somewhat the
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
locals don't always return the tablets
 
01:37:12.669 --> 01:37:12.679 align:start position:0%
to us timely with their return of votes
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
um so we would need additional tablets
 
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
in the case of that event um what the
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
the additional time that the
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
municipality would need is that they
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
would need time to then go to a vendor
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
um most likely the vendor we use since
 
01:37:30.189 --> 01:37:30.199 align:start position:0%
they're using our equipment to program
 
01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
their local ballot so this is something
 
01:37:35.229 --> 01:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't do because they are
 
01:37:38.910 --> 01:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
each local programs their own ballot
 
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
they don't have to um use our printer
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
they don't have to use um the setup of
 
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
the ballot that we do at State um
 
01:37:48.270 --> 01:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
elections so this is something that is
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
done locally and they they still follow
 
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
the law but they can do it however they
 
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
wish to so there's a lot of time and
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
testing involved and um security of the
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
tablet involved and I think that's what
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
the um the fiscal note reflects is that
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
there's there's going to be some
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
Manpower from our office and new
 
01:38:06.109 --> 01:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
equipment from our office that needs to
 
01:38:09.149 --> 01:38:09.159 align:start position:0%
be purchased um there is one thing that
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
I want to point out in the bill on page
 
01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
two there's some um as a representative
 
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
paid page alluded to there's some
 
01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
statutory construction issues with the
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh bottom of page one actually it starts
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
and it changes amends RSA
 
01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
66925 to read and it in it crosses out
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
the word town and puts in local and adds
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
cities into there um this shouldn't be
 
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
done in the statute it should be done in
 
01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:41.320 align:start position:0%
each individual statute um it would
 
01:38:44.229 --> 01:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
cause some um election law issues that
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
we see Pop Up in other areas so anytime
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
you want to address a a local election
 
01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
or a city election it should be done in
 
01:38:53.589 --> 01:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
those statutes there's also a concern
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
that um some City Charters would have to
 
01:38:59.790 --> 01:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
be amended to reflect this um and that
 
01:39:01.709 --> 01:39:01.719 align:start position:0%
would have to be on a charter by Charter
 
01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
basis so you can't just put into law if
 
01:39:05.950 --> 01:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
the charter is already in place and says
 
01:39:08.589 --> 01:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
something differently um and not a
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
lawyer again but my understanding is
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
this this paragraph needs to be updated
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
to include each individual paragraph
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
that would refer to a local or a city
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
election I'm happy to take questions
 
01:39:24.589 --> 01:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
representative bone thank you Mr
 
01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you SEC deputy
 
01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
secretary taking a question um yeah I've
 
01:39:31.870 --> 01:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
been involved with a lot of local
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
elections and I know the town is
 
01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:35.550 align:start position:0%
elections and I know the town is
responsible

01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
01:39:38.589 --> 01:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
for um programming the machines and
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
whatnot that's not an issue but I see an
 
01:39:43.390 --> 01:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
issue here do you see that this could be
 
01:39:48.109 --> 01:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
a 28a issue if the towns have to buy the
 
01:39:48.119 --> 01:39:50.030 align:start position:0%
a 28a issue if the towns have to buy the
tablets

01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
tablets
 
01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:53.320 align:start position:0%
if 28a where they would the it's a
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
mandate that they the legislature would
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
force them to spend money yes um I'm not
 
01:40:01.149 --> 01:40:01.159 align:start position:0%
a lawyer so I would re I would leave
 
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
that up to the lawyers in the
 
01:40:05.589 --> 01:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
room thank you further questions
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you um just
 
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.070 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you um just
for

01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
clarification is the Secretary of
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
State's office taking a position on this
 
01:40:19.470 --> 01:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
bill and if there were a vendor able to
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
coordinate the cleaning of these
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
devices um with
 
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:29.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities would the Secretary of
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
State's office
 
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
support um enabling municipalities to
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
engage with that vendor to take it off
 
01:40:39.629 --> 01:40:39.639 align:start position:0%
your plate thank you for the question um
 
01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
I think I our office would support the
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
bill if it has the corrections that I
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
recommended um ISS uh corrected in there
 
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
um the um outside vendor this is the
 
01:40:52.030 --> 01:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
first I've heard of that come up it
 
01:40:53.070 --> 01:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
didn't come up in any of the
 
01:40:54.990 --> 01:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
conversations I had with the bill about
 
01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
an outside vendor taking over the
 
01:40:59.430 --> 01:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
process would I consider a security
 
01:41:01.390 --> 01:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
process so I'd have to have discussions
 
01:41:03.870 --> 01:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
with my it team but my initial reaction
 
01:41:05.709 --> 01:41:05.719 align:start position:0%
would be no we do not want an outside
 
01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
vendor um taking over a security
 
01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
election security thing but I would need
 
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
to know more about the process followup
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
please yep it's fine
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
um I thought I heard you say in your
 
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier that you currently
 
01:41:24.270 --> 01:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
contract with a vendor to do the wiping
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
of these programming the I'm sorry the
 
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
programming yes um so perhaps maybe I'm
 
01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:33.189 align:start position:0%
programming yes um so perhaps maybe I'm
Mis

01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
Mis
 
01:41:33.199 --> 01:41:34.709 align:start position:0%
Mis
um

01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting um or you know
 
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
attributing programming and uh wiping
 
01:41:43.229 --> 01:41:43.239 align:start position:0%
these clean would a
 
01:41:46.189 --> 01:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
vendor um perhaps the same vendor that
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
you use be available to municipalities
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
to do the programming um for these local
 
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
ballots that um are within the purview
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
of the municipality is that something
 
01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
you would support um engaging the
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
municipality with that vendor yes our
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
office is happy to um adjust our
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
contracts if needed I believe they
 
01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:11.719 align:start position:0%
currently do say that um it the contract
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
that we have with the current vendor
 
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
which is democracy live would um is
 
01:42:19.109 --> 01:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
accessible to cities and towns to use as
 
01:42:21.149 --> 01:42:21.159 align:start position:0%
well okay is that was that your question
 
01:42:21.159 --> 01:42:22.070 align:start position:0%
well okay is that was that your question
thank

01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:42:25.709 --> 01:42:25.719 align:start position:0%
you representative Lane uh thank you Mr
 
01:42:28.109 --> 01:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
chair um I think someone has already
 
01:42:30.109 --> 01:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
asked the question of you that I had
 
01:42:31.950 --> 01:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
promised to ask but I will ask another
 
01:42:36.510 --> 01:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
one um do you will this apply only tob2
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
towns or would it
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
be that's my question one that's my
 
01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:42.910 align:start position:0%
be that's my question one that's my
first

01:42:42.910 --> 01:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you for the question so
 
01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:48.639 align:start position:0%
again the way the language is written
 
01:42:51.229 --> 01:42:51.239 align:start position:0%
it's kind of unclear now because it just
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
it puts language into a section of law
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
that it's not the appropriate section it
 
01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be put into any other sections
 
01:43:00.990 --> 01:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
but I believe it would it would apply to
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
um school districts Village districts
 
01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
cities so any local municipal election
 
01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
but and I believe that's the intent of
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
of the sponsor but I'm not positive on
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
that yep
 
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
follow um do you have do you have a
 
01:43:21.189 --> 01:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
sense of how many that how many towns
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
or I and for the for the cities I guess
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
how many polling places that would
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
be uh sorry um 308 is what I said but I
 
01:43:35.589 --> 01:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
don't know like locally it again we
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
don't run local elections so I don't
 
01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
know how many they use locally I'm
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
assuming it's the same
 
01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
um sorry and I believe I missp spoke
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
before I think it's 308 not 208 so
 
01:43:54.790 --> 01:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
I thank you um um oh
 
01:43:57.790 --> 01:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
gosh how many do you own now how many of
 
01:43:59.870 --> 01:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
these tablets does the Secretary State
 
01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:01.950 align:start position:0%
these tablets does the Secretary State
own

01:44:01.950 --> 01:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:44:05.629 --> 01:44:05.639 align:start position:0%
out I'm taking a guess but when I SP in
 
01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
the fall when I spoke to Our IT
 
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
department on this it was there we had a
 
01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
buffer over the so if we need 308 I
 
01:44:15.629 --> 01:44:15.639 align:start position:0%
believe we have 320 but I'm not positive
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
on that exact number right
 
01:44:21.149 --> 01:44:21.159 align:start position:0%
now representative Brennan thank you um
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
isn't it true
 
01:44:27.629 --> 01:44:27.639 align:start position:0%
that towns that have adopted official
 
01:44:30.510 --> 01:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
ballot um operate their Municipal
 
01:44:33.229 --> 01:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
elections using that official ballot for
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
the election of candidates and Zoning
 
01:44:38.910 --> 01:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
amendments and therefore would apply to
 
01:44:41.790 --> 01:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
Beyond sv2 towns but town meeting towns
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
that have adopted That official ballot
 
01:44:45.589 --> 01:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
process which I believe and perhaps the
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
new New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
can answer this um all town meeting
 
01:44:53.229 --> 01:44:53.239 align:start position:0%
towns have adopted That official ballot
 
01:44:54.750 --> 01:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
for the election of their candidates and
 
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
Zoning amendments and any other thing
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
ballot I need a clarification on that
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the municipal Association can
 
01:45:06.750 --> 01:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
answer that but I believe this bill does
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
elections further questions on the
 
01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you deputy
 
01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:18.920 align:start position:0%

01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
behind we're going to come right back um
 
01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
but we're going to allow for the
 
01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
introduction of 1310 so the sponsor can
 
01:45:27.550 --> 01:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
go about their the rest of their
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
business um and then we're going to come
 
01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
right back to it so we're just going to
 
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%

open the public he on House Bill 1310
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
relative to meetings of the supervisor
 
01:45:38.669 --> 01:45:38.679 align:start position:0%
of the checklist going to allow for the
 
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill once the bill
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
is introduced we going to immediately
 
01:45:41.950 --> 01:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
recess the bill and we're going to go
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
1264 representative Lan you're
 
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
recognized um thank you Mr chairman I
 
01:45:50.910 --> 01:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
greatly appreciate this um my name is is
 
01:45:52.870 --> 01:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative Erica Leon I represent
 
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
the town of dairy and if this bill looks
 
01:45:57.629 --> 01:45:57.639 align:start position:0%
familiar to you it is uh very similar to
 
01:45:59.229 --> 01:45:59.239 align:start position:0%
the bill as amended that came out of the
 
01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
committee last year but was tabled on
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
the floor I know that you've heard
 
01:46:04.510 --> 01:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
another bill about increasing the
 
01:46:06.750 --> 01:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
frequency of cleaning the voter cleaning
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
the checklist from 10 years to four
 
01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:10.719 align:start position:0%
years this bill was actually introduced
 
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
as a way to have ongoing the the
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
underlying bill um of maintaining the
 
01:46:17.709 --> 01:46:17.719 align:start position:0%
checklist on an ongoing basis by
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
checking it with death records with
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle records and with property
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
transactions in the town was a way that
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
was intended to allow for greater
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
ongoing checklist Management in the town
 
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
of Derry we've had um almost 2,000
 
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
voters who had left town removed from
 
01:46:37.709 --> 01:46:37.719 align:start position:0%
the from the voter roles after the
 
01:46:41.189 --> 01:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
10-year voter Purge and by doing this
 
01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:42.639 align:start position:0%
we've been able to keep a more
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
consistent more tight number of Voters
 
01:46:47.149 --> 01:46:47.159 align:start position:0%
on the polls um as you're aware the
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
number of um voting stations and many
 
01:46:51.310 --> 01:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
other things are based upon the number
 
01:46:53.589 --> 01:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
of registered voters in the town so this
 
01:46:55.229 --> 01:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
has a great impact on day-to-day
 
01:46:58.270 --> 01:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
election processes unfortunately not
 
01:47:00.589 --> 01:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
every supervisor of the checklist has
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
actually meant to deal with the uh deal
 
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
with the information that has come the
 
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
largest one is that um the law now
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
provides that the national change of
 
01:47:12.750 --> 01:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
address registry um provides information
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
annually through a check done by the
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to the towns because
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
there are towns and cities that are not
 
01:47:20.990 --> 01:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
meeting in order to handle the data
 
01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
their voter roles are unnecessarily
 
01:47:25.629 --> 01:47:25.639 align:start position:0%
inflated um this bill simply would
 
01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
require them to meet um at least every
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
90 days for the purpose of periodic
 
01:47:33.709 --> 01:47:33.719 align:start position:0%
checklist maintenance so you know that's
 
01:47:35.709 --> 01:47:35.719 align:start position:0%
that's not overly frequent that's four
 
01:47:38.189 --> 01:47:38.199 align:start position:0%
times a year that could be handled in
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
their other business if they choose to
 
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
do that at another supervisor session
 
01:47:44.350 --> 01:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
which they have done in Dairy
 
01:47:46.270 --> 01:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because some supervisors
 
01:47:48.629 --> 01:47:48.639 align:start position:0%
have met and only done the statutorily
 
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
required minimum this law is
 
01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately necessary um I I believe
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
that by doing this and making sure that
 
01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
the supervisors are actually processing
 
01:48:00.589 --> 01:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
those data that are available to them we
 
01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
won't need to have such a burdensome
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
process every 10 years or every four
 
01:48:06.910 --> 01:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
years if the other bill in front of you
 
01:48:09.189 --> 01:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
this year were to pass um so with that
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions that you
 
01:48:13.709 --> 01:48:13.719 align:start position:0%
have other questions from the
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you
 
01:48:18.270 --> 01:48:18.280 align:start position:0%

voting independently with a secret
 
01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
ballot has been been a passion of mine
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
for several decades I am a member of the
 
01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
Coalition of blind and visual visually
 
01:49:31.950 --> 01:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
impaired voters and we are a Statewide
 
01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
group of consumers and agency
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives working on voting access
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
for the past eight years we have worked
 
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
with the Secretary of State's office to
 
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
have state and federal elections with
 
01:49:49.629 --> 01:49:49.639 align:start position:0%
accessible ballots and in 2018 I was
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
able to to fill out my ballot with the
 
01:49:55.229 --> 01:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
one for all device place it in the Box
 
01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
along with everyone else it was a
 
01:49:59.709 --> 01:49:59.719 align:start position:0%
feeling of great
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
accomplishment along with having state
 
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
and federal elections accessible
 
01:50:07.709 --> 01:50:07.719 align:start position:0%
regarding voting the Coalition also
 
01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:10.679 align:start position:0%
wanted towns and cities to have the same
 
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
right presently exiter and conquered are
 
01:50:16.589 --> 01:50:16.599 align:start position:0%
the only
 
01:50:19.709 --> 01:50:19.719 align:start position:0%
two municipalities with accessible
 
01:50:19.719 --> 01:50:21.629 align:start position:0%
two municipalities with accessible
ballot

01:50:21.629 --> 01:50:21.639 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
and it happened um in conquer a
 
01:50:27.870 --> 01:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
gentleman filed a complaint with the
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and he won his
 
01:50:33.709 --> 01:50:33.719 align:start position:0%
case and then conqur has to have
 
01:50:36.189 --> 01:50:36.199 align:start position:0%
accessible ballots for their um
 
01:50:39.950 --> 01:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal meetings and um in exitor many
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
of us with vision loss worked hard with
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
exitor to get the ballot
 
01:50:48.430 --> 01:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
accessible and I'm going to talk about
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
my experience with voting and exiter
 
01:50:54.750 --> 01:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
last year was our first time voting with
 
01:50:57.229 --> 01:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
an accessible ballot and I want to say
 
01:50:59.550 --> 01:50:59.560 align:start position:0%
this is where it gets personal for me
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
before then I would bring my town clerk
 
01:51:05.550 --> 01:51:05.560 align:start position:0%
into the ballot with me and she would
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
read the long three ballots I'd say the
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
town ballots are the most complicated
 
01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
and lengthy ballots of any of them
 
01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
especially compared to this last one we
 
01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
went through when we just voted for one
 
01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:21.270 align:start position:0%
went through when we just voted for one
person

01:51:21.270 --> 01:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
um I went in last year it was a very
 
01:51:28.629 --> 01:51:28.639 align:start position:0%
snowy day went into my booth put on my
 
01:51:32.550 --> 01:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
headset used my arrow keys selected my
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
candidates voted on the article warrants
 
01:51:38.669 --> 01:51:38.679 align:start position:0%
and then took my ballots three of them
 
01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
and put them in the box and it was just
 
01:51:44.669 --> 01:51:44.679 align:start position:0%
a very empowering experience for me I
 
01:51:47.669 --> 01:51:47.679 align:start position:0%
was so glad that I could vote that
 
01:51:50.430 --> 01:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
way and I want to say I want everyone
 
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
with a disability to experience that we
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
all have the right constitutionally to
 
01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
vote with a SE ballot and we don't have
 
01:52:01.470 --> 01:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
it yet and I don't think we should be
 
01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
waiting for another session to have this
 
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
happen I want to ask you to consider
 
01:52:10.510 --> 01:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
passing this bill this
 
01:52:13.069 --> 01:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
year we have this right for state and
 
01:52:13.079 --> 01:52:14.390 align:start position:0%
year we have this right for state and
federal

01:53:09.189 --> 01:53:09.199 align:start position:0%
welcome to election
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
law thank you very much my name is Dana
 
01:53:14.589 --> 01:53:14.599 align:start position:0%
Trahan this is my guide tikva under the
 
01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:16.199 align:start position:0%
table checking things out before she
 
01:53:18.589 --> 01:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
decides to lay
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
down um
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
I too am a resident of exiter and a part
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
of the Coalition of blind vision
 
01:53:28.109 --> 01:53:28.119 align:start position:0%
impaired voters um I was cited until I
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
lost my site back in 2010 in 2010 I lost
 
01:53:33.189 --> 01:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
my sight to the extent that I'm vision
 
01:53:37.149 --> 01:53:37.159 align:start position:0%
impaired or legally blind um and so I
 
01:53:39.629 --> 01:53:39.639 align:start position:0%
was able to vote independently and
 
01:53:42.030 --> 01:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
confidentially On My Own by going into
 
01:53:43.629 --> 01:53:43.639 align:start position:0%
the voting booth and and marking my
 
01:53:47.629 --> 01:53:47.639 align:start position:0%
ballot until 2010 when things changed
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
and um I'm imagining that you all here
 
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
would would have a hard time with that
 
01:53:53.790 --> 01:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
too you know having it be that you can
 
01:53:56.109 --> 01:53:56.119 align:start position:0%
no longer just exercise your right right
 
01:53:58.589 --> 01:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
to vote and be confidential and uh
 
01:54:02.189 --> 01:54:02.199 align:start position:0%
independent about it so um I was happy
 
01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
at the time when there was some
 
01:54:05.629 --> 01:54:05.639 align:start position:0%
accessible system in place I remember
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
there was something with a telephone
 
01:54:08.910 --> 01:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
keypad that we could make selections
 
01:54:12.109 --> 01:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
with and it faxed somewhere um but
 
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
especially pleased when the one forall
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
came into place for the federal and
 
01:54:18.030 --> 01:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
state elections um to be able to go in
 
01:54:20.589 --> 01:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
and vote on my own again
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
um by either you know using the keyboard
 
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
and the arrow keys like Gina described
 
01:54:27.550 --> 01:54:27.560 align:start position:0%
or by using the tablet as representative
 
01:54:30.510 --> 01:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
page has described um either way and
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
it's the system is called the one for
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
all and I love to say that it's one
 
01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
system for all to use um the Secretary
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
of State's office worked very nicely
 
01:54:41.589 --> 01:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
with us when we had different um
 
01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
concerns about um the audio quality or
 
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know the fact that originally it
 
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't a pre-printed ballot it was a
 
01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
matter of our votes printed on a plain
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
piece of paper so we had to put them on
 
01:54:53.470 --> 01:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
the side of the the counting machine so
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
it was a little different that way but
 
01:54:56.950 --> 01:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
the fact now that it's a pre-printed
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
ballot and we can vote as all others do
 
01:55:01.990 --> 01:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
um I know someone was concerned about
 
01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
the walking the ballot from the the
 
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
booth to the machine and it's easy
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
enough to even keep that private I know
 
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
Jean for instance will ask our town
 
01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
clerk for a manila envelope to put her
 
01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
Ballot or ballots into and she can carry
 
01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
them privately and insert them to the
 
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
machine as everyone else does
 
01:55:23.229 --> 01:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
um I too you know I I never really
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
realized the importance of being able to
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
vote independently and privately because
 
01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:29.800 align:start position:0%
I just did it you know just like I I
 
01:55:31.629 --> 01:55:31.639 align:start position:0%
didn't really understand the the
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
importance of public transportation
 
01:55:35.109 --> 01:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
because I just always got in my car and
 
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
went where I wanted to go when I wanted
 
01:55:40.830 --> 01:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
to go so having the change in my ability
 
01:55:43.229 --> 01:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
um has really brought it to my attention
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
um being a part of the Coalition it's
 
01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
wonderful to help try to spread the word
 
01:55:48.669 --> 01:55:48.679 align:start position:0%
about it um I'd love to challenge you
 
01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
all here to to use the one forall system
 
01:55:54.149 --> 01:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
the next time it's time to uh vote an
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%

that I need help with in my day-to-day

modified so that I can do it
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%

01:58:02.669 --> 01:58:02.679 align:start position:0%
anybody else I I love that you know I
 
01:58:06.189 --> 01:58:06.199 align:start position:0%
love the feeling of of being able to to
 
01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
do things on my own including
 
01:58:10.239 --> 01:58:12.229 align:start position:0%
do things on my own including
voting

01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
voting
 
01:58:12.239 --> 01:58:13.790 align:start position:0%
voting
and

01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh I do vote and I've used the
 
01:58:21.709 --> 01:58:21.719 align:start position:0%
accessible voting system before and it
 
01:58:26.229 --> 01:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
is fantastic it works well and I'm very
 
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
grateful to have that available for

01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
few different residents in ward 3 who um

routinely use our accessible voting
 
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
booth and um this past municipal
 
01:59:58.830 --> 01:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
election one of those voters came and

was very very frustrated that she um was
 
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
not able to use the accessible voting

machine uh to cast her ballot um she
 
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:08.480 align:start position:0%

02:00:18.069 --> 02:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
completely understood she did come back
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
for our presidential election and was
 
02:00:21.390 --> 02:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
excited to be able to use the accessible
 
02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
voting machine um something that's
 
02:00:24.629 --> 02:00:24.639 align:start position:0%
interesting about Manchester they
 
02:00:26.830 --> 02:00:26.840 align:start position:0%
actually do set up the booths even
 
02:00:28.910 --> 02:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
though they're not able to be used the
 
02:00:30.589 --> 02:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
booths are there and they look exactly
 
02:00:34.069 --> 02:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
the same as they do for the um for the
 
02:00:35.790 --> 02:00:35.800 align:start position:0%
state elections people just use them as
 
02:00:37.229 --> 02:00:37.239 align:start position:0%
a private booth rather than having to
 
02:00:39.470 --> 02:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
use the machine um so I don't imagine
 
02:00:41.149 --> 02:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
that it would be a huge lift
 
02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
particularly not for our local election
 
02:00:45.629 --> 02:00:45.639 align:start position:0%
officials to be able to use it um but it
 
02:00:47.790 --> 02:00:47.800 align:start position:0%
would certainly help our voters so happy
 
02:00:50.149 --> 02:00:50.159 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions uh questions
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
from the committee um I actually have
 
02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
one have you have you spoke with the
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
city clerk at all about this um I
 
02:00:58.149 --> 02:00:58.159 align:start position:0%
haven't actually okay I might reach out
 
02:00:59.669 --> 02:00:59.679 align:start position:0%
to him so just want just curious if you
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
already talked to him all right thank
 
02:01:05.470 --> 02:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
you um next up we're going back into
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:21.109 --> 02:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg good morning I'm also bringing
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm Karen Rosenberg I'm the policy
 
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
director at the disability rights Center
 
02:01:26.910 --> 02:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
this is my colleague James zigra who is
 
02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
a senior staff attorney at our office
 
02:01:30.229 --> 02:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
who knows all things election law and
 
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
I'm bringing him up in case you all have
 
02:01:34.589 --> 02:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
any technical questions for him um
 
02:01:36.030 --> 02:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center is a state's
 
02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
protection and advocacy system for
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities and we strongly
 
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
support this bill um as you've heard
 
02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
being able to cast one's vote privately
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
is a fundamental right it is something
 
02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
that is just of Supreme importance to
 
02:01:54.669 --> 02:01:54.679 align:start position:0%
all of us and um in all elections
 
02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester had an election this past
 
02:01:59.750 --> 02:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
November where we elected a I I live in
 
02:02:02.830 --> 02:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester our mayor and that was a
 
02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
contentious election and people with
 
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities if they wanted to vote
 
02:02:09.790 --> 02:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
would have to share who they were going
 
02:02:12.390 --> 02:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
to be voting for in that election and
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's just wrong so um we think it's
 
02:02:17.109 --> 02:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
really important to do this and it can
 
02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:20.719 align:start position:0%
be done and you've heard that we already
 
02:02:24.109 --> 02:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
own these machines as a state um we you
 
02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
will also hear from the municipal
 
02:02:28.270 --> 02:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
Association that they are you know that
 
02:02:29.950 --> 02:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
that the folks that they represent the
 
02:02:32.830 --> 02:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities are happy to take on the
 
02:02:34.589 --> 02:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility to pay for the cost of
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
programming cleaning transporting these
 
02:02:40.709 --> 02:02:40.719 align:start position:0%
machines um if needed um they will they
 
02:02:42.270 --> 02:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
will do it they're already responsible
 
02:02:45.069 --> 02:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
for running their local elections and
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
they want people to vote too so I hope
 
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
that you all do if we need an amendment
 
02:02:52.510 --> 02:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
to add some statutory references that
 
02:02:54.750 --> 02:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
seems very easily done we'd be happy to
 
02:02:56.229 --> 02:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
work with the secretary of state I'm
 
02:02:59.229 --> 02:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
sure that all the folks behind us would
 
02:03:02.109 --> 02:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
be happy to do that so um if you've got
 
02:03:04.109 --> 02:03:04.119 align:start position:0%
questions I'm happy to answer them but
 
02:03:06.189 --> 02:03:06.199 align:start position:0%
I'm really hoping that you will support
 
02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
this bill questions from the
 
02:03:14.069 --> 02:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:18.270 --> 02:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
thanks next up is Randy pierce with
 
02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:28.669 align:start position:0%
 
site

02:03:28.669 --> 02:03:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:30.639 align:start position:0%
table all right thank you for the
 
02:03:33.390 --> 02:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak with you today so I
 
02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
am randy Pierce I am the president and
 
02:03:37.790 --> 02:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
CEO of future in sight many of you
 
02:03:39.229 --> 02:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
probably know it as the New Hampshire
 
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
Association for the blind we serve the
 
02:03:43.470 --> 02:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
entire state but we also serve me I am
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
totally blind myself as I have been for
 
02:03:48.910 --> 02:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
a little over 20 years now so the the
 
02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
reason I'm here is to highlight three
 
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
points first gratitude I love the
 
02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
progress our state has made because when
 
02:03:58.149 --> 02:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
I first went blind I like Dana had to
 
02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
transfer from voting on my own
 
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
independently and in privacy to stepping
 
02:04:06.830 --> 02:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
into a booth and I'm 6'4 with a nice
 
02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
tall guide dog to match up with a person
 
02:04:10.510 --> 02:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
to record it a person to witness it and
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
we are tighter than on the elevator on
 
02:04:15.510 --> 02:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
the way up here when we do that and once
 
02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
that even happened without the person
 
02:04:18.430 --> 02:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
making judgmental comments as they
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
recorded my vote right that's not what
 
02:04:22.709 --> 02:04:22.719 align:start position:0%
we want for our citizens that's not what
 
02:04:24.229 --> 02:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
we deserve that's why we have this
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
system and we've made a long stride
 
02:04:28.149 --> 02:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
towards there but the fact that it is
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
only encompassing part of our elections
 
02:04:32.549 --> 02:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
is something that many legislators I've
 
02:04:34.709 --> 02:04:34.719 align:start position:0%
spoken with didn't realize previously
 
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
and now that we do I want to applaud you
 
02:04:38.589 --> 02:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
for taking steps towards the solution
 
02:04:40.750 --> 02:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
because we serve there are 28,000
 
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
constituents in New Hampshire who are
 
02:04:44.510 --> 02:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
sight impaired profound sight loss to
 
02:04:46.229 --> 02:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
the point that this system can benefit
 
02:04:47.790 --> 02:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
them and that's not even counting the
 
02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
rest of the print disability abilities
 
02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
out there and of those folks that means
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
every one of your communities has many
 
02:04:55.189 --> 02:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
people I was born grew up I was born in
 
02:04:57.549 --> 02:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
ASA grew up in cber 27 people that we
 
02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
know about in Nash in coldbrook New
 
02:05:01.709 --> 02:05:01.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire over a thousand in nashwa
 
02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
right that could qualify for these why
 
02:05:05.229 --> 02:05:05.239 align:start position:0%
aren't they using the system because
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
consistency is what they need when they
 
02:05:08.189 --> 02:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
go in one time and they're allowed to
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
vote accessibly they go in another time
 
02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
they're not they're intimidated to use
 
02:05:14.069 --> 02:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
it the best form of advocacy any of us
 
02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
can do in my opinion is to be competent
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
and to be confident but when you get
 
02:05:21.069 --> 02:05:21.079 align:start position:0%
undermined every step of the way that's
 
02:05:23.189 --> 02:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
a challenge I feel like I strive towards
 
02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
that every day and I still struggle when
 
02:05:27.790 --> 02:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
I have to go into my municipal election
 
02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
and can't vote with the right means so
 
02:05:34.069 --> 02:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
for all the other 28,000 and for me I
 
02:05:35.589 --> 02:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
strongly urge you to consider all of the
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
ramifications that come if we don't meet
 
02:05:41.310 --> 02:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
our federal requirement to provide
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
voting in an accessible fashion I'd
 
02:05:45.549 --> 02:05:45.559 align:start position:0%
welcome any questions questions from the
 
02:05:48.430 --> 02:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
committee representative we uh thank you
 
02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr Pierce for
 
02:05:51.629 --> 02:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
taking my question just I I wanted to
 
02:05:53.549 --> 02:05:53.559 align:start position:0%
get a clarification on one of the
 
02:05:56.109 --> 02:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
numbers you mentioned you said 28,000
 
02:05:58.149 --> 02:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
not including and what was the phrase
 
02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
that you print disabled so there are
 
02:06:02.750 --> 02:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
people who might have an a disability
 
02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
which is not site related but inhibits
 
02:06:07.790 --> 02:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
their ability to read the ballot whether
 
02:06:10.030 --> 02:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
it's dyslexia whether it's many forms of
 
02:06:12.030 --> 02:06:12.040 align:start position:0%
those right that would exponentially
 
02:06:14.430 --> 02:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
increase it thank you you're welcome
 
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative PR O'Brien thank you uh
 
02:06:19.069 --> 02:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Pierce uh I really
 
02:06:21.790 --> 02:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here today I just
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
want to ask one clarification you
 
02:06:29.149 --> 02:06:29.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you you only had one time
 
02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
that you went into the voting booth
 
02:06:32.750 --> 02:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
where you felt like the person assisting
 
02:06:36.589 --> 02:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
you was not making judgments about how
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
you voted is this correct that is
 
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
exactly what I said and understand
 
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
either the person who is recording it or
 
02:06:43.990 --> 02:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
the person who was there to witness them
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
recording it what a terrible situation
 
02:06:47.709 --> 02:06:47.719 align:start position:0%
and we've had a lot of contentious
 
02:06:49.790 --> 02:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
elections through the years and when
 
02:06:51.549 --> 02:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
you're involved and first off as a
 
02:06:53.390 --> 02:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
public figure for all the work I have to
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
do I don't want my vote being shared I
 
02:06:59.669 --> 02:06:59.679 align:start position:0%
don't deserve my vote being shared but
 
02:07:01.229 --> 02:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
that's exactly
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
right Paul uh further questions I I do
 
02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
have one along the line where do you
 
02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
vote so I just moved two years ago to
 
02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
take this job and I now vote in
 
02:07:12.910 --> 02:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
Canterbury New Hampshire Sam is great
 
02:07:14.669 --> 02:07:14.679 align:start position:0%

02:07:17.149 --> 02:07:17.159 align:start position:0%
accessible equipment okay where was your
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%

02:07:21.069 --> 02:07:21.079 align:start position:0%
was in N I was born in Nash spent the
 
02:07:22.629 --> 02:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
bulk of my life there hopefully there's
 
02:07:25.229 --> 02:07:25.239 align:start position:0%
more life ahead mind you but yeah okay
 
02:07:26.910 --> 02:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it's just those things like
 
02:07:28.310 --> 02:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
that are obviously very concerning to us
 
02:07:30.990 --> 02:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
so probably uh I filed the complaints
 
02:07:32.549 --> 02:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
not only with the clerk but also with
 
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%

of the committee my name is Mackenzie St
 
02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
Germaine with the New Hampshire campaign
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
for voting rights which is a project of
 
02:10:50.589 --> 02:10:50.599 align:start position:0%
America boats New Hampshire um we are
 
02:10:53.189 --> 02:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
here today in strong support of this
 
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill um and you've heard firsthand the
 
02:10:57.669 --> 02:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
reasons today why these accessible
 
02:10:59.950 --> 02:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
machines are important I hope through
 
02:11:01.549 --> 02:11:01.559 align:start position:0%
discussions and work on this bill and
 
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
Logistics everyone can keep in mind and
 
02:11:05.549 --> 02:11:05.559 align:start position:0%
remember that we all agree on the
 
02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
importance of every voter being able to
 
02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
cast their ballot independently and
 
02:11:12.270 --> 02:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
privately whether they're voting for
 
02:11:14.069 --> 02:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
president State Rep school board or
 
02:11:16.589 --> 02:11:16.599 align:start position:0%
anything else um also I know there's
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
been conversations around the machines
 
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
that we have versus new machines um I
 
02:11:22.270 --> 02:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
think there are benefits and we would
 
02:11:24.390 --> 02:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
support if at all possible using these
 
02:11:27.069 --> 02:11:27.079 align:start position:0%
same devices for the federal state and
 
02:11:29.709 --> 02:11:29.719 align:start position:0%
local elections um not only for the
 
02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
voter experience and having folks go in
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
and being consistent and knowing exactly
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
how to vote how the devices work and
 
02:11:38.430 --> 02:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
what to expect but also for training
 
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
training for election officials um one
 
02:11:43.229 --> 02:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
of the things we hear a lot on Election
 
02:11:45.149 --> 02:11:45.159 align:start position:0%
Day or in the fall up on Election Day
 
02:11:47.669 --> 02:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
was issues around the accessible voting
 
02:11:47.679 --> 02:11:48.669 align:start position:0%
was issues around the accessible voting
devices

02:11:48.669 --> 02:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
devices
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
because they are you know an extra step
 
02:11:52.430 --> 02:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
of training that folks need the
 
02:11:53.950 --> 02:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
moderators and election officials need
 
02:11:56.109 --> 02:11:56.119 align:start position:0%
to learn about um I know that our
 
02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
election officials take it very
 
02:11:59.830 --> 02:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
seriously but there can be mistakes in
 
02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
setting them up or knowing how they work
 
02:12:03.430 --> 02:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
having consistent equipment each
 
02:12:05.270 --> 02:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
election can help ensure that we can
 
02:12:07.629 --> 02:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
train people up really well and that
 
02:12:09.870 --> 02:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
equipment is set up whether it be local
 
02:12:12.189 --> 02:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
state elections again ensuring that
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
folks are able to cast their ballot
 
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
privately and independently um and if we
 
02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
were to get new equipment in the future
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
again it being consistent using the
 
02:12:23.149 --> 02:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
state equipment and being able to have
 
02:12:24.990 --> 02:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
um groups that train like future and
 
02:12:27.229 --> 02:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
sight being able to train voters getting
 
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
everyone up to speed on how the
 
02:12:32.229 --> 02:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
Equipment Works how they need to use it
 
02:12:34.350 --> 02:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
um and confident in doing that to remove
 
02:12:36.629 --> 02:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
some of those barriers so thank you all
 
02:12:38.270 --> 02:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
and Happy to answer questions questions
 
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
from the committee seeing none thank you
 
02:12:43.390 --> 02:12:43.400 align:start position:0%

02:12:53.629 --> 02:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair n Grace for the
 
02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we are committed
 
02:12:59.229 --> 02:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
to uh solving this issue this session um
 
02:13:01.149 --> 02:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
obviously as you've heard today this is
 
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
a liability issue for municipalities
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
conquered nextra have already experience
 
02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
that and it's clearly a fairness issue
 
02:13:10.510 --> 02:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
for disabled voters so um to answer some
 
02:13:12.189 --> 02:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
of the committee's questions um it does
 
02:13:13.709 --> 02:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
appear that an amendment is needed I'm
 
02:13:15.790 --> 02:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
more than happy to work with uh the
 
02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor and stakeholders to ensure that
 
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
we can uh get something that
 
02:13:23.589 --> 02:13:23.599 align:start position:0%
works um I believe that we can uh
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps modify the definition of
 
02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
accessible voting system
 
02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
slightly um to clarify what that means
 
02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
and then shorten up this paragraph two
 
02:13:34.149 --> 02:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
on page two so that we can resolve the
 
02:13:36.669 --> 02:13:36.679 align:start position:0%
issue with uh enables all individuals
 
02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
with disabilities to vote just to make
 
02:13:41.109 --> 02:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
it clear that we're talking about a
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
system similar to the one forall system
 
02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
um obviously our interest here is the
 
02:13:49.149 --> 02:13:49.159 align:start position:0%
same as other stakeholders in making
 
02:13:53.669 --> 02:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
sure that um we we can clarify uh how
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
this process works and make it as
 
02:13:57.950 --> 02:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
seamless as possible and as similar as
 
02:13:59.830 --> 02:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
possible to what happens in state and
 
02:14:02.030 --> 02:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
federal elections as well as address
 
02:14:03.950 --> 02:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
those security concerns because we want
 
02:14:06.310 --> 02:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure that everyone's vote um is
 
02:14:08.589 --> 02:14:08.599 align:start position:0%
counted um the other thing I want to
 
02:14:13.229 --> 02:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
mention is uh that I did learn in a
 
02:14:14.350 --> 02:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
meeting with the Secretary of State's
 
02:14:16.549 --> 02:14:16.559 align:start position:0%
office that we are expecting at some
 
02:14:19.109 --> 02:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
point information from the federal
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
government um answering a question about
 
02:14:24.549 --> 02:14:24.559 align:start position:0%
whether those uh devices used for state
 
02:14:26.549 --> 02:14:26.559 align:start position:0%
and federal elections can be used for
 
02:14:26.559 --> 02:14:27.750 align:start position:0%
and federal elections can be used for
local

02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
local
 
02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
elections obviously I anticipate the
 
02:14:31.709 --> 02:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
answer to that will be yes I assume that
 
02:14:33.229 --> 02:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
means we'll have to purchase some more
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
devices at the state level to make sure
 
02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
we have enough in circulation that we
 
02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
can service local elections in addition
 
02:14:41.709 --> 02:14:41.719 align:start position:0%
to uh the state elections when we have a
 
02:14:44.149 --> 02:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
time crunch um I don't know how many
 
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
devices that would be off the top of my
 
02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
head but I'm sure someone can do the
 
02:14:48.589 --> 02:14:48.599 align:start position:0%
math on that
 
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
um and just to clarify uh with the
 
02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
committee I do anticipate and I do not
 
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
see any issue with municipalities paying
 
02:14:58.990 --> 02:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
for the programming costs of those
 
02:15:01.470 --> 02:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
devices we will obviously need to have
 
02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
the secretary or some vendor selected by
 
02:15:06.350 --> 02:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
the secretary set some timelines to make
 
02:15:08.709 --> 02:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
sure we can get them the content of the
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
warrant to uh whoever is programming
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
that in a correct in enough time that
 
02:15:17.149 --> 02:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
can happen as well as ensure that those
 
02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
devices get back in a timely fashion um
 
02:15:22.109 --> 02:15:22.119 align:start position:0%
but I think this is doable um and I'm
 
02:15:23.149 --> 02:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions the
 
02:15:24.510 --> 02:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
committee may have questions from the
 
02:15:26.709 --> 02:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
committee representative Mo thank you Mr
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
02:15:29.470 --> 02:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
question I have a
 
02:15:34.229 --> 02:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
question on elections in non sb2
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
towns uh Town Town elections uh Town
 
02:15:40.709 --> 02:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
meetings school board meetings which are
 
02:15:43.870 --> 02:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
done differently in different towns um
 
02:15:46.950 --> 02:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
so and also even deliber deliberative
 
02:15:51.669 --> 02:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
sessions so how you think we need do in
 
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
those those areas so what I would
 
02:15:57.310 --> 02:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
anticipate is this would apply to any
 
02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
use of the official ballot that's
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
defined under 403 and
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
4014 um so there a couple options
 
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
obviously at very traditional town
 
02:16:09.910 --> 02:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
meeting everyone shows up at the meeting
 
02:16:11.910 --> 02:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
and you vote there's no ballot um
 
02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
there's a modified version of that where
 
02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
you can vote for officers you vote for
 
02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
select board Etc I anticipate it would
 
02:16:21.870 --> 02:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
be used for that election of officers um
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
and then you have
 
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
a kind of the step above that is the SP2
 
02:16:27.950 --> 02:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
town where you vote for all of the
 
02:16:29.629 --> 02:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
warrant articles as well as the election
 
02:16:31.389 --> 02:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
of officers it would be used for that as
 
02:16:34.549 --> 02:16:34.559 align:start position:0%
well I believe the intent is to use it
 
02:16:36.709 --> 02:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
on the school side as well as well as in
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
cities so I think the amendment needs
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
will clarify that to make sure it
 
02:16:43.669 --> 02:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
captures exactly what what's meant here
 
02:16:45.629 --> 02:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
because that's what we saw in conquered
 
02:16:47.910 --> 02:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
as well as exiter obviously conquer a
 
02:16:50.549 --> 02:16:50.559 align:start position:0%
city exitor as a town so um they have
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
different experiences but it's the same
 
02:16:56.110 --> 02:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
concern that was brought forward follow
 
02:16:58.830 --> 02:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
up follow up followup at Del liberative
 
02:17:00.669 --> 02:17:00.679 align:start position:0%
session there are some cases where there
 
02:17:03.389 --> 02:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
needs to be a secret ballot do you think
 
02:17:07.309 --> 02:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
this needs to be done at that also so
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
there's also an unofficial balloting
 
02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
portion of town meeting I don't I don't
 
02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
know that it
 
02:17:19.230 --> 02:17:19.240 align:start position:0%
would be part of that um we'd have to
 
02:17:22.030 --> 02:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
look at that process and just clarify it
 
02:17:25.349 --> 02:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
to make sure we can use it as much as
 
02:17:27.070 --> 02:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
we're allowed
 
02:17:29.509 --> 02:17:29.519 align:start position:0%
to further questions from the committee
 
02:17:33.509 --> 02:17:33.519 align:start position:0%

just to make sure I'm understanding your
testimony

02:17:37.709 --> 02:17:37.719 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:17:41.389 --> 02:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
accurately um municipalities that you
 
02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
represent uh that are nhma members are
 
02:17:48.270 --> 02:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
fine with footing the bill
 
02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
for one forall system or similar to be
 
02:17:57.910 --> 02:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
used in municipalities to ensure that
 
02:17:57.920 --> 02:17:59.509 align:start position:0%
used in municipalities to ensure that
um

02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:03.469 --> 02:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
all residents all eligible voters within
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
that municipality are capable
 
02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
of casting their ballot in the secret
 
02:18:16.509 --> 02:18:16.519 align:start position:0%
secure way that is promised to
 
02:18:16.519 --> 02:18:19.549 align:start position:0%
secure way that is promised to
everyone

02:18:19.549 --> 02:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:22.549 --> 02:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
I think that the law requires us to do
 
02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:24.639 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
02:18:27.070 --> 02:18:27.080 align:start position:0%

of New Hampshire supports like I think
 
02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
most if not all of this committee and
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
most of not all this house does uh the
 
02:18:53.709 --> 02:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
ability of everyone to vote um with
 
02:18:55.709 --> 02:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
dignity and Independence and so we
 
02:18:57.950 --> 02:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
support this Bill thank you will you be

02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
get cups of coffee at elections we just
 
02:21:06.910 --> 02:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
work um I think we probably meet this
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
bill but I don't really want to have to
 
02:21:12.510 --> 02:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
be counting days to add one more job to
 
02:21:14.469 --> 02:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
my responsibilities we strongly believe
 
02:21:17.429 --> 02:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
in voting we want to support voters we
 
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
want to get them on the checklist in a
 
02:21:24.110 --> 02:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
reasonably fast rate and um more
 
02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
meetings would not help that there's a
 
02:21:27.910 --> 02:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
lot of work to the checklist I presume
 
02:21:29.670 --> 02:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
you all are aware of that that we have
 
02:21:32.270 --> 02:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
to not just register a vote but enter
 
02:21:35.389 --> 02:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
them and do the filing and it just
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
continues on we do a lot of
 
02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
work thank you would you will you be
 
02:21:41.550 --> 02:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
taking questions from the committee sure
 
02:21:43.630 --> 02:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee okay that's easy thank you so
 
02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
much thank you um is there anyone else
 
02:21:49.870 --> 02:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
who wishes to speak to houseb 1310 I
 
02:21:52.030 --> 02:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
don't see any pink CS in my possession
 
02:21:54.990 --> 02:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none um we had one person signed
 
02:21:56.790 --> 02:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
up on the blue sheet they were in
 
02:21:58.590 --> 02:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
opposition online there was three in
 
02:22:01.110 --> 02:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
support 33 opposed and one neutral with
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to close the public
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 310 so look at
 
02:22:06.910 --> 02:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
that we're moving again um and I'm going
 
02:22:08.590 --> 02:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
to now open the public hearing on House
 
02:22:11.190 --> 02:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
Bill 1384 relative to non-compliance by
 
02:22:15.870 --> 02:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
a town or uh Ward moderator and clerk uh
 
02:22:17.309 --> 02:22:17.319 align:start position:0%
I believe representative we are you
 
02:22:19.790 --> 02:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
introducing this Bill yes sir okay I
 
02:22:22.429 --> 02:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
don't see no you're good representative
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
where to go introduce um we do have one
 
02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
weie all right thank you Mr chair and
 
02:22:42.150 --> 02:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members for the
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
record my name is Robert wary and I have
 
02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
the privilege of serving in Hillsboro
 
02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
County's 13th District District the
 
02:22:49.150 --> 02:22:49.160 align:start position:0%
great town of
 
02:22:52.750 --> 02:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
Hudson um I said uh the following in
 
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
last week's public hearing on House Bill
 
02:22:57.070 --> 02:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
1381 relative to the training on
 
02:22:59.469 --> 02:22:59.479 align:start position:0%
Election procedures and bears repeating
 
02:23:01.070 --> 02:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
the great state of New Hampshire has
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
many wonderful clerks and moderators and
 
02:23:05.309 --> 02:23:05.319 align:start position:0%
many other election officials who
 
02:23:07.150 --> 02:23:07.160 align:start position:0%
diligently performed their job and
 
02:23:09.230 --> 02:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
handled their responsibilities with
 
02:23:12.389 --> 02:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
great professionalism and integrity
 
02:23:14.710 --> 02:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
these individuals are in the majority
 
02:23:17.269 --> 02:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
and they are not the problem I would ask
 
02:23:18.750 --> 02:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
to last week's comments that the
 
02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
performance of election duties is
 
02:23:23.269 --> 02:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
relatively complex at least as indicated
 
02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
by the thickness of our RSA books and
 
02:23:29.230 --> 02:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
the election law procedures manual and
 
02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
not only is it complex procedurally it's
 
02:23:34.510 --> 02:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
complex because of the variableness of
 
02:23:36.750 --> 02:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
resources required ac across the
 
02:23:38.990 --> 02:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
different types of Elections except for
 
02:23:42.349 --> 02:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
maybe dixville Knox I guess um and given
 
02:23:44.790 --> 02:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
the variableness of the number of voters
 
02:23:47.070 --> 02:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
between the various local elections
 
02:23:49.990 --> 02:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
primary elections um midterm elections
 
02:23:52.710 --> 02:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
general elections the required resources
 
02:23:55.830 --> 02:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
vary greatly another another factor that
 
02:23:58.590 --> 02:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
must be considered is the fact that
 
02:24:01.269 --> 02:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
elections are only performed
 
02:24:03.550 --> 02:24:03.560 align:start position:0%
sporadically elections can never be a
 
02:24:05.790 --> 02:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
routine operation because they are never
 
02:24:08.750 --> 02:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
routinely performed so given the
 
02:24:11.230 --> 02:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
intrinsic complexity of Elections
 
02:24:13.630 --> 02:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
performing elections must be recognized
 
02:24:16.190 --> 02:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
as a challenging series of tasks which
 
02:24:18.230 --> 02:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
must be carefully
 
02:24:20.429 --> 02:24:20.439 align:start position:0%
performed and also this was brought up
 
02:24:22.429 --> 02:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
by one of the moderators testifying last
 
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
week that that this RSA is limited to
 
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
moderators and clerks it is only limited
 
02:24:30.469 --> 02:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
in that way because of the original
 
02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
language of that of RSA
 
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
65977 that is limited to moderators and
 
02:24:39.070 --> 02:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
clerks and perhaps additional an
 
02:24:41.790 --> 02:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
additional RSA is needed um that would
 
02:24:43.469 --> 02:24:43.479 align:start position:0%
put the same requirements for other
 
02:24:45.990 --> 02:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
election officials that already exists
 
02:24:48.590 --> 02:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
for moderators and and clerks but that
 
02:24:51.070 --> 02:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
is perhaps an LSR for next
 
02:24:54.309 --> 02:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
year so what is the problem that this
 
02:24:56.110 --> 02:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to address there is a
 
02:24:58.950 --> 02:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
small there is a concern that some small
 
02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
minority again I would emphasize small
 
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
minority of election officials are not
 
02:25:07.389 --> 02:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
diligent in following the procedures and
 
02:25:09.389 --> 02:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
that this lack of diligence is due to
 
02:25:12.590 --> 02:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with procedures and a neg
 
02:25:14.670 --> 02:25:14.680 align:start position:0%
a level of negligence that results in
 
02:25:17.429 --> 02:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
significant errors the the original
 
02:25:22.469 --> 02:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
language only addressed int intentional
 
02:25:25.269 --> 02:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
neglect now we heard in a testimony a
 
02:25:27.710 --> 02:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago on House Bill
 
02:25:30.750 --> 02:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
1364 that the Judiciary Committee uses a
 
02:25:33.070 --> 02:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
four-fold framework for assessing
 
02:25:35.750 --> 02:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
culpability namely purposefully
 
02:25:37.990 --> 02:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
knowingly recklessly and
 
02:25:40.790 --> 02:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
carelessly so intentionality or
 
02:25:43.389 --> 02:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
purposefully is likely difficult to
 
02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
prove unless there's a forensic audit or
 
02:25:47.630 --> 02:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
an investigation by the Attorney
 
02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:48.830 align:start position:0%
an investigation by the Attorney
General's

02:25:48.830 --> 02:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
General's
 
02:25:51.750 --> 02:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
office so the language in this RSA has
 
02:25:55.630 --> 02:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
been modified to address a relative
 
02:25:58.190 --> 02:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
inability to address intentionality
 
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
directly lack of training which already
 
02:26:03.590 --> 02:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
exists addresses the knowingly aspect
 
02:26:05.950 --> 02:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
the additional language seeks to address
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
the culpability aspects of recklessly
 
02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
and carelessly and finally some
 
02:26:12.429 --> 02:26:12.439 align:start position:0%
additional language reaffirms that this
 
02:26:15.110 --> 02:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
RSA should only come into play when
 
02:26:18.429 --> 02:26:18.439 align:start position:0%
there is a significant
 
02:26:21.230 --> 02:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
deficiency so uh with that I am happy to
 
02:26:23.870 --> 02:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
take any questions and answer if I can
 
02:26:25.269 --> 02:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
02:26:28.590 --> 02:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
committee representative Lane um thank
 
02:26:30.269 --> 02:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative um you your last
 
02:26:35.870 --> 02:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
statement was if I heard it correctly
 
02:26:38.389 --> 02:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
was this was aimed for
 
02:26:41.230 --> 02:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
significant misb significant
 
02:26:43.550 --> 02:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
non-compliance because I don't reading
 
02:26:45.990 --> 02:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
it quickly I don't see where that stands
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
out so um so in lines 19 and line
 
02:26:55.750 --> 02:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
22 there's already language existing in
 
02:26:58.990 --> 02:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
the current RSA for significant
 
02:27:01.990 --> 02:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
deficiency and deficiencies and then
 
02:27:05.870 --> 02:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
significant deficiency and then on page
 
02:27:09.389 --> 02:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
two of the amendment um oh I'm sorry
 
02:27:10.870 --> 02:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
wait a second hang
 
02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:13.230 align:start position:0%
wait a second hang
on

02:27:13.230 --> 02:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:27:16.750 --> 02:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
um oh a preponderance of ADV oh uh line
 
02:27:19.190 --> 02:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
21 significant deficiency is also added
 
02:27:20.870 --> 02:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
she'll document the reported facts and
 
02:27:22.750 --> 02:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances of the significant
 
02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
deficiency so that's where that's is
 
02:27:28.349 --> 02:27:28.359 align:start position:0%
that what you were asking about yes um
 
02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay follow up are you clarifying about
 
02:27:33.389 --> 02:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
the amendment yes I think you Miss B you
 
02:27:34.710 --> 02:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
don't have an amendment correct you're
 
02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
just talking about the B sorry
 
02:27:40.870 --> 02:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's changes to the RSA I'm sorry it's
 
02:27:43.469 --> 02:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
already been a long day so it's it's
 
02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
totally to totally yeah it was a little
 
02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
bit confusing I knew I I knew what you
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
meant I believed in thank
 
02:27:53.630 --> 02:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
you sorry all right further questions
 
02:27:54.670 --> 02:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:27:56.830 --> 02:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
02:28:00.070 --> 02:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
Hammer hi thanks for taking my question
 
02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
where has this happened
 
02:28:07.750 --> 02:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
to what town city do you have any
 
02:28:10.870 --> 02:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
idea well we have we have heard
 
02:28:14.910 --> 02:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
testimony about um our um Hudson
 
02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
neighbor Windham and and uh We've also
 
02:28:20.510 --> 02:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
heard about the senate race for District
 
02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
24 I believe it is um and so I think
 
02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:28.230 align:start position:0%
24 I believe it is um and so I think
those

02:28:28.230 --> 02:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:28:32.030 --> 02:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
are uh I think some of the inducements
 
02:28:34.830 --> 02:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
behind this because as as everyone
 
02:28:37.750 --> 02:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
probably recalls but um there were over
 
02:28:41.389 --> 02:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
130 issues found in the first and then
 
02:28:43.349 --> 02:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
in the subsequent two-year thing which
 
02:28:47.349 --> 02:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
was observed by um
 
02:28:49.269 --> 02:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
a member of the Secretary of State's
 
02:28:51.990 --> 02:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
office um there was still an additional
 
02:28:57.349 --> 02:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
30 some errors or issues that were uh
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
noted and and the testimony uh that we
 
02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
heard a few weeks ago with regard to The
 
02:29:09.510 --> 02:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
District 24 Senator race had um an a
 
02:29:13.230 --> 02:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
large number of issues as well um if you
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
want I'm happy to provide that
 
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
additional detail
 
02:29:19.070 --> 02:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
to you um
 
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
offline further questions from the
 
02:29:24.790 --> 02:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um next
 
02:29:41.269 --> 02:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:43.469 --> 02:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
Hennessy thank you Mr chair members of
 
02:29:45.190 --> 02:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Aaron Hennessy
 
02:29:47.230 --> 02:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state
 
02:29:49.429 --> 02:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
and we have a some concerns over the
 
02:29:52.389 --> 02:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
language of the bill that changes the
 
02:29:52.399 --> 02:29:55.990 align:start position:0%
language of the bill that changes the
language

02:29:55.990 --> 02:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:59.389 --> 02:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
from neglect to non-compliance what that
 
02:30:02.550 --> 02:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
would mean is that anyone who
 
02:30:04.710 --> 02:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
unintentionally makes a mathematical
 
02:30:06.590 --> 02:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
error is a
 
02:30:10.950 --> 02:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
non-compliance and um who um may have
 
02:30:13.070 --> 02:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
been able to correct that in the past
 
02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
would now be in violation under these
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
sections um our fear is that um you will
 
02:30:21.870 --> 02:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
see in your um cities and towns that you
 
02:30:26.349 --> 02:30:26.359 align:start position:0%
will be unable to um have people sign up
 
02:30:28.790 --> 02:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
to run for these election official
 
02:30:31.349 --> 02:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
positions um because no one would want
 
02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
to be um caught in
 
02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
non-compliance um who may never have
 
02:30:39.670 --> 02:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
done something intentionally um in
 
02:30:43.510 --> 02:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
neglect of but may very extremely
 
02:30:45.030 --> 02:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
unintentionally done something in
 
02:30:47.870 --> 02:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
non-compliance of and that's our um
 
02:30:49.750 --> 02:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
concerns with this legislation I'm happy
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
to take
 
02:30:55.110 --> 02:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:59.429 --> 02:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
questions okay with that thank
 
02:31:07.990 --> 02:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:12.110 --> 02:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
Al you got it thank you how do you I
 
02:31:14.309 --> 02:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
think we all need lessons in printing
 
02:31:14.319 --> 02:31:15.349 align:start position:0%
think we all need lessons in printing
myself

02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
myself
 
02:31:15.359 --> 02:31:16.870 align:start position:0%
myself
included

02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
included
 
02:31:16.880 --> 02:31:19.429 align:start position:0%
included
thank

02:31:19.429 --> 02:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:22.110 --> 02:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you for having me uh my name
 
02:31:24.030 --> 02:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
is Al brandano I'm from Kensington New
 
02:31:26.510 --> 02:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm voting i' I'd ask for
 
02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
you to vote in favor of uh HB
 
02:31:31.950 --> 02:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
1384 I think one of the most important
 
02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
things we've heard in this committee
 
02:31:37.710 --> 02:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
time and time again uh is uh secretary
 
02:31:40.389 --> 02:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
scandin every time he attends here he
 
02:31:42.870 --> 02:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
tells you that the most important goal
 
02:31:45.790 --> 02:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
for him is voter confidence over and
 
02:31:47.429 --> 02:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
over and and over
 
02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
again um so this is really important
 
02:31:52.429 --> 02:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
because I believe this is where the
 
02:31:55.349 --> 02:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
rubber meets the road for hearing from
 
02:31:57.349 --> 02:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
the people themselves rather than
 
02:31:59.590 --> 02:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
somebody with an orange badge this is
 
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
really important I want to take a little
 
02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
bit of the history um there have been
 
02:32:06.830 --> 02:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
three formal complaints in Windam that
 
02:32:09.190 --> 02:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
have not been answered by the Attorney
 
02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
General yet that's over a 2-year period
 
02:32:15.110 --> 02:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
what does that do for voter
 
02:32:17.630 --> 02:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
confidence uh there were over 200
 
02:32:19.750 --> 02:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
complaints combined in those three
 
02:32:22.750 --> 02:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
formal to the attorney general no
 
02:32:27.429 --> 02:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
response Senate District 24 had over 147
 
02:32:29.950 --> 02:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
violations and they weren't violations
 
02:32:33.790 --> 02:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
of uh not um simple violations these we
 
02:32:37.230 --> 02:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
were these were significant so sign
 
02:32:39.510 --> 02:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
significant in fact that the ballot law
 
02:32:42.550 --> 02:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
commission uh voted 5 to1 to move this
 
02:32:45.830 --> 02:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
to the Attorney General yet a year later
 
02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
no formal
 
02:32:49.950 --> 02:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
response so what does the average
 
02:32:54.190 --> 02:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
citizen and voter believe does does Mr
 
02:32:59.110 --> 02:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
scanland um goals ring true apparently
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
not um one of the most important parts
 
02:33:06.349 --> 02:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
in uh the Senate District 24 was when
 
02:33:08.950 --> 02:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
chairman um the chairman of the ballot
 
02:33:11.550 --> 02:33:11.560 align:start position:0%
law commission asked Lugar jula's
 
02:33:14.190 --> 02:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
attorney do you believe these violations
 
02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
affected the outcome of the election
 
02:33:19.309 --> 02:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
attorney McDonald with these many
 
02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
violations how can you prove it did not
 
02:33:25.469 --> 02:33:25.479 align:start position:0%
and this is the problem we have clerks
 
02:33:28.910 --> 02:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
and moderators article two uh part two
 
02:33:30.910 --> 02:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
article 32 of the New Hampshire
 
02:33:33.349 --> 02:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution makes them the people who
 
02:33:36.110 --> 02:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
sort and count votes they are the
 
02:33:40.830 --> 02:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
responsible party laws that are against
 
02:33:43.309 --> 02:33:43.319 align:start position:0%
discipline if we can't hold somebody
 
02:33:45.309 --> 02:33:45.319 align:start position:0%
accountable we have no discipline we
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
have no we have no voting we don't have
 
02:33:49.309 --> 02:33:49.319 align:start position:0%
anything to believe in if we can't hold
 
02:33:55.070 --> 02:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
people accountable and I and I strongly
 
02:33:58.230 --> 02:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
um oppose the fact that people will not
 
02:34:01.070 --> 02:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
show up and and and participate in the
 
02:34:04.309 --> 02:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
voting process if you look in most towns
 
02:34:06.349 --> 02:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
they don't ask people to show up they
 
02:34:08.790 --> 02:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
don't ask people to come and hand count
 
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
most small towns or most towns have
 
02:34:13.550 --> 02:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
their own group of people that they
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
continue to go to it's not open to us
 
02:34:19.389 --> 02:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
and many people would be would love to
 
02:34:21.750 --> 02:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
participate if we just were
 
02:34:24.510 --> 02:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
asked and why not hold these people
 
02:34:26.429 --> 02:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
accountable that's why I'm asking if you
 
02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
really believe in voter confidence and
 
02:34:30.269 --> 02:34:30.279 align:start position:0%
you believe in this give something back
 
02:34:33.469 --> 02:34:33.479 align:start position:0%
to the people and I'll take any
 
02:34:36.990 --> 02:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
questions any questions represent Brena
 
02:34:40.670 --> 02:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um you specifically cited
 
02:34:45.590 --> 02:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
Windham and the issues there and if if I
 
02:34:47.190 --> 02:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
understand the sit situation
 
02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
correctly um the issues came
 
02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
from elected
 
02:34:57.750 --> 02:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
officials that the voters selected and
 
02:35:01.110 --> 02:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
would it not be um possible for the
 
02:35:03.790 --> 02:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
voters to hold those election officials
 
02:35:06.590 --> 02:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
accountable at The Ballot Box by
 
02:35:10.750 --> 02:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
choosing another person to run the
 
02:35:12.830 --> 02:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
elections uh great question
 
02:35:15.590 --> 02:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative and you always do um it's
 
02:35:17.790 --> 02:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
really sad that we don't have a press
 
02:35:20.349 --> 02:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
anymore people don't know about this
 
02:35:22.550 --> 02:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
this is the problem we're having there's
 
02:35:25.750 --> 02:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
no more local press people are not
 
02:35:28.190 --> 02:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
informed and if they're not informed and
 
02:35:33.309 --> 02:35:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:37.349 --> 02:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
know is it not the responsibility of the
 
02:35:40.910 --> 02:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
candidate for elected office to spread
 
02:35:43.630 --> 02:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
their message to encourage voters to
 
02:35:46.990 --> 02:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
turn out to vote for them as opposed to
 
02:35:49.710 --> 02:35:49.720 align:start position:0%
someone who may
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
have um caused difficulty in previous
 
02:35:57.150 --> 02:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
elections I'm not sure I understand the
 
02:35:59.710 --> 02:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
question because what I'm trying to say
 
02:36:02.389 --> 02:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
here is that these issues have gone if
 
02:36:05.469 --> 02:36:05.479 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General is not responding
 
02:36:07.630 --> 02:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
where else does the voter turn to it's
 
02:36:10.190 --> 02:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
up to the attorney general to see or how
 
02:36:11.990 --> 02:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to react we're saying
 
02:36:14.590 --> 02:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
after 3 years and two years we have
 
02:36:16.269 --> 02:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
nothing nothing from the attorney
 
02:36:18.349 --> 02:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
general nothing from the Secretary of
 
02:36:21.030 --> 02:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
State the people don't know where to
 
02:36:23.910 --> 02:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
turn and that's not a good place to be
 
02:36:25.670 --> 02:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
for voter
 
02:36:27.630 --> 02:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
confidence thank
 
02:36:31.110 --> 02:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:33.190 --> 02:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
Burnham um thank you for taking my
 
02:36:34.910 --> 02:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
you do you believe this bill would um
 
02:36:40.750 --> 02:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
hold the Secretary of State's office and
 
02:36:43.950 --> 02:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General uh more accountable
 
02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
to further investigate and and try to um
 
02:36:51.950 --> 02:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
fix the wrongs within that local area I
 
02:36:54.550 --> 02:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
think I I'm hopeful what it will do and
 
02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
this is why I was really this was a
 
02:36:59.670 --> 02:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
positive this bill is a real positive
 
02:37:02.190 --> 02:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
because one it shines light as as
 
02:37:03.990 --> 02:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan was talking about
 
02:37:06.510 --> 02:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
earlier about Shining Light on something
 
02:37:09.550 --> 02:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
making it a so people can view what's
 
02:37:11.150 --> 02:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
really happening or understand but
 
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
second of all right now there is no
 
02:37:17.910 --> 02:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
there's no pressure on anybody to do
 
02:37:20.070 --> 02:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
anything right to hold anybody
 
02:37:22.590 --> 02:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
accountable there is none if you look at
 
02:37:24.590 --> 02:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General how many cases have
 
02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:25.870 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General how many cases have
they

02:37:25.870 --> 02:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:30.269 align:start position:0%
they
prosecuted

02:37:30.269 --> 02:37:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
zero questions representative Bon thank
 
02:37:36.990 --> 02:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
you is it possible that the attorney
 
02:37:39.510 --> 02:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
general and the Secretary of State's
 
02:37:41.830 --> 02:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
office have not found legitimate
 
02:37:45.550 --> 02:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
evidence to support prosecution of um
 
02:37:49.389 --> 02:37:49.399 align:start position:0%
crime crimes associated with your claims
 
02:37:51.429 --> 02:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
that's a great question it hasn't been
 
02:37:54.309 --> 02:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
adjudicated we're all waiting to hear
 
02:37:56.950 --> 02:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
and there you know Justice delayed is
 
02:37:59.429 --> 02:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
not Justice served this is the problem
 
02:38:01.550 --> 02:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
with voter confidence it's it's like a
 
02:38:03.710 --> 02:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
soap bubble you know once it breaks it's
 
02:38:05.950 --> 02:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
you can't bring it back trust is
 
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
everything and I think this bill will
 
02:38:10.870 --> 02:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
help build trust between the local the
 
02:38:14.389 --> 02:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
voter themselves and and you know the
 
02:38:19.550 --> 02:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:21.990 --> 02:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
from no sorry further questions from the
 
02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%

fellow committee members
 
02:39:52.429 --> 02:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
um for those of you who are involved in
 
02:39:54.750 --> 02:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
your local elections uh you may be
 
02:39:56.750 --> 02:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
familiar with the moderator's checklist
 
02:39:58.990 --> 02:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
or not if you're a moderator which I
 
02:40:01.309 --> 02:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
just learned that um representative
 
02:40:06.750 --> 02:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
Hamet is that um it is after a long day
 
02:40:09.269 --> 02:40:09.279 align:start position:0%
and evening it's an arduous process for
 
02:40:11.550 --> 02:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
the moderator with all the forms they
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
need to complete and uh this past
 
02:40:16.790 --> 02:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
primary I sat down with my moderator
 
02:40:20.870 --> 02:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
just to watch um how he addressed the
 
02:40:23.590 --> 02:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
this uh worksheet to the moderator's
 
02:40:27.389 --> 02:40:27.399 align:start position:0%
worksheet um this this came up because
 
02:40:29.590 --> 02:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
as we were looking at the worksheets in
 
02:40:32.070 --> 02:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
the past it was very difficult for the
 
02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:33.389 align:start position:0%
the past it was very difficult for the
moderators

02:40:33.389 --> 02:40:33.399 align:start position:0%
moderators
 
02:40:37.710 --> 02:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
to come up with a balanced number so
 
02:40:41.910 --> 02:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
this here is just an inventory so let me
 
02:40:45.349 --> 02:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
just back up a little bit here um it's
 
02:40:47.110 --> 02:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
it's so this is completed at the end of
 
02:40:49.990 --> 02:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
the election night and it's typically
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
called the election night moderators
 
02:40:53.870 --> 02:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
worksheet but then there's different
 
02:40:55.309 --> 02:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
names so I think it's been adjusted a
 
02:41:00.429 --> 02:41:00.439 align:start position:0%
few times um and uh after even speaking
 
02:41:02.590 --> 02:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
with uh deputy secretary of state
 
02:41:05.830 --> 02:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
Hennessee uh when this was being drafted
 
02:41:07.990 --> 02:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
I had learned uh that there are
 
02:41:13.750 --> 02:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
additional means of um ballots that are
 
02:41:16.870 --> 02:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
included but are grouped together so
 
02:41:20.429 --> 02:41:20.439 align:start position:0%
this kind of gives an overview of the
 
02:41:20.439 --> 02:41:22.030 align:start position:0%
this kind of gives an overview of the
individual

02:41:22.030 --> 02:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:41:25.670 --> 02:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
ballot um groups and that's what we're
 
02:41:28.950 --> 02:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
really trying to do is account for the
 
02:41:31.389 --> 02:41:31.399 align:start position:0%
um every ballot and within the group
 
02:41:35.870 --> 02:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
that they're in um so hopefully uh the
 
02:41:38.190 --> 02:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
ballot inventory and Reconciliation will
 
02:41:40.150 --> 02:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
meet the standards for many voter
 
02:41:42.190 --> 02:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
Integrity groups as well as assist our
 
02:41:44.269 --> 02:41:44.279 align:start position:0%
moderators with a more concise tally at
 
02:41:47.830 --> 02:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
the end of the election night and then
 
02:41:51.550 --> 02:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
after just listening to the bill earlier
 
02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
um that just might be another one that
 
02:41:55.550 --> 02:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
we can group so we can have
 
02:42:00.590 --> 02:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
accountability for the Ada um printout
 
02:42:03.990 --> 02:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
ballots um so that that might be needed
 
02:42:07.190 --> 02:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
as well I do have um an amendment that I
 
02:42:09.349 --> 02:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
passed out along with a sample of the
 
02:42:11.429 --> 02:42:11.439 align:start position:0%
worksheet I'm kind of one of those if
 
02:42:13.150 --> 02:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to complain about something I
 
02:42:16.030 --> 02:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
also want to have Solutions so you have
 
02:42:20.990 --> 02:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
a somewhat um revised worksheet and um
 
02:42:22.790 --> 02:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment I wasn't able to
 
02:42:24.910 --> 02:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
get it because um I know how quickly you
 
02:42:27.750 --> 02:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
want to get through um the bills so it
 
02:42:29.950 --> 02:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
is waiting um and there might be an
 
02:42:31.510 --> 02:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
additional amendment to that so that's
 
02:42:33.710 --> 02:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
why I didn't rush for it after uh
 
02:42:35.309 --> 02:42:35.319 align:start position:0%
speaking a little bit more in detail
 
02:42:41.670 --> 02:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:45.469 --> 02:42:45.479 align:start position:0%
there so the current um worksheet can be
 
02:42:49.070 --> 02:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
be found in our manual if you you
 
02:42:50.309 --> 02:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
probably all don't have one because it's
 
02:42:52.150 --> 02:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
really heavy but I brought mine today I
 
02:42:54.910 --> 02:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
lugged it here it's it's uh got the
 
02:42:57.269 --> 02:42:57.279 align:start position:0%
exercise for that one that was great so
 
02:43:01.150 --> 02:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
you can see um if you had that you can
 
02:43:04.550 --> 02:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
kind of compare to where it is currently
 
02:43:06.790 --> 02:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
and where we kind of want to move
 
02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:09.269 align:start position:0%
and where we kind of want to move
forward

02:43:09.269 --> 02:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:43:12.150 --> 02:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
um we have heard already the need for
 
02:43:14.230 --> 02:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
better accountability of our ballots and
 
02:43:17.429 --> 02:43:17.439 align:start position:0%
that also includes absentee ballots this
 
02:43:19.630 --> 02:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
process will not ask for any additional
 
02:43:21.910 --> 02:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
work from the clerk or the moderator
 
02:43:23.870 --> 02:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
because this process is already being
 
02:43:26.990 --> 02:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
done by adding a few additional area
 
02:43:29.309 --> 02:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
areas of tallies the new proposed
 
02:43:31.710 --> 02:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
worksheet will provide the information
 
02:43:33.950 --> 02:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
needed to keep track of all the ballots
 
02:43:35.950 --> 02:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
and provide better accountability of the
 
02:43:38.550 --> 02:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
ballots one of the things I did note
 
02:43:40.510 --> 02:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
watching our moderator is sometimes he
 
02:43:42.710 --> 02:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
had to back in the numbers to kind of
 
02:43:45.269 --> 02:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
make it work well that's not really the
 
02:43:47.750 --> 02:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
the way we should be doing it so we want
 
02:43:50.990 --> 02:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
to have better accountability for the um
 
02:43:54.469 --> 02:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
inventory of all ballots on the ballots
 
02:43:57.269 --> 02:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh inventory section one the number of
 
02:43:59.309 --> 02:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
test ballots are now included in the
 
02:44:02.469 --> 02:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
beginning so in previous they were never
 
02:44:05.230 --> 02:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
included uh typically the clerk will
 
02:44:09.790 --> 02:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
receive 100 ballots for them to test um
 
02:44:12.790 --> 02:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
and so we just thought it's a ballot
 
02:44:14.110 --> 02:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
even though it's a test ballot they
 
02:44:16.469 --> 02:44:16.479 align:start position:0%
should be included
 
02:44:20.309 --> 02:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
um it also uh it separates um that
 
02:44:21.870 --> 02:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
section also separates the number of
 
02:44:24.670 --> 02:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
photo copied versus absentee ballots
 
02:44:27.070 --> 02:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
vers instead of having them grouped
 
02:44:30.110 --> 02:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
together um the absentee ballots that
 
02:44:32.389 --> 02:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
are used as official election day
 
02:44:34.630 --> 02:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
ballots so this is not your absentee
 
02:44:36.630 --> 02:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
ballots but say they run out and they
 
02:44:38.590 --> 02:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
they need the ballot so they can
 
02:44:40.830 --> 02:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
actually grab an absentee ballot and use
 
02:44:43.230 --> 02:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
that as the official day
 
02:44:47.910 --> 02:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
ballot um so part two provides its own
 
02:44:50.550 --> 02:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
section actually let me just back up one
 
02:44:55.030 --> 02:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
more thing on section one so after
 
02:44:56.990 --> 02:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
plugging in some numbers and making sure
 
02:44:58.990 --> 02:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
everything was working out I realized
 
02:45:02.349 --> 02:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
that in section one E and F are
 
02:45:05.269 --> 02:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
redundant and so I'm going to recommend
 
02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
an amendment to remove them um that will
 
02:45:11.590 --> 02:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
bring us the correct calculation uh for
 
02:45:14.190 --> 02:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
that section part two provides its own
 
02:45:16.950 --> 02:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
section for DRS and T ballots inventory
 
02:45:18.670 --> 02:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
and of course this portion will be
 
02:45:20.910 --> 02:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
required for the clerk to provide the
 
02:45:22.670 --> 02:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
moderator with some of the figures but
 
02:45:26.030 --> 02:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
the clerk will already have them so um
 
02:45:29.150 --> 02:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
that's easily accessible section three
 
02:45:32.349 --> 02:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
is formerly B on the current one that
 
02:45:36.309 --> 02:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
has not changed section four formally C
 
02:45:39.670 --> 02:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh it just has a few edits changing ACU
 
02:45:42.590 --> 02:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
vote to election machine device because
 
02:45:44.550 --> 02:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
we will no longer have the ACU vote so
 
02:45:47.150 --> 02:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
that kind of up dates that section five
 
02:45:49.670 --> 02:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
is formally D which is the hand count
 
02:45:53.070 --> 02:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
ballots cast that has not changed and so
 
02:45:55.550 --> 02:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
part two has an edit from election night
 
02:45:58.190 --> 02:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
reconciliation form which is another
 
02:45:59.990 --> 02:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
form that the moderator has to complete
 
02:46:01.870 --> 02:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
to just reconciliation form because
 
02:46:03.950 --> 02:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's what's listed on the header of
 
02:46:05.550 --> 02:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
the form so we're just trying to keep
 
02:46:08.830 --> 02:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
some consistency and clean things up uh
 
02:46:11.030 --> 02:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
the tally category just adds the
 
02:46:13.870 --> 02:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot section two and then the
 
02:46:15.510 --> 02:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
rest Remains the Same
 
02:46:18.190 --> 02:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
so the updated formula for this
 
02:46:20.550 --> 02:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
worksheet and the reason why it went to
 
02:46:22.710 --> 02:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
numbers versus letters is just because
 
02:46:25.510 --> 02:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
the way that OS set it up so I had to
 
02:46:29.110 --> 02:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
make it consistent with the bill and so
 
02:46:31.030 --> 02:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
therefore that's why it's changed to the
 
02:46:32.990 --> 02:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
numbers it's just the technicality thing
 
02:46:37.269 --> 02:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
there I guess uh Total 1 I plus total 2
 
02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
H would then equal total to J and you if
 
02:46:45.389 --> 02:46:45.399 align:start position:0%
you follow along on there um you can uh
 
02:46:47.389 --> 02:46:47.399 align:start position:0%
see what how that would total up and it
 
02:46:49.830 --> 02:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
continues that it equals total three
 
02:46:53.110 --> 02:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
total four and total section five which
 
02:46:54.870 --> 02:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
then equals your counts of votes in the
 
02:46:56.790 --> 02:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
contest and hopefully it all balances
 
02:47:00.790 --> 02:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
out that's the goal um so this is I do
 
02:47:02.950 --> 02:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
have that amendment I do want to remove
 
02:47:07.110 --> 02:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
the other sections so um and I think I
 
02:47:10.269 --> 02:47:10.279 align:start position:0%
clarified anything there so I'm open to
 
02:47:11.830 --> 02:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:47:17.190 --> 02:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:20.190 --> 02:47:20.200 align:start position:0%
Hamlet and thank you representative
 
02:47:25.030 --> 02:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
burnam um so yeah there are things that
 
02:47:28.230 --> 02:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
I like about this bill uh I have one I
 
02:47:30.550 --> 02:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
have a few questions about one question
 
02:47:35.670 --> 02:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
is in it's on page two down near the
 
02:47:41.710 --> 02:47:41.720 align:start position:0%
bottom under Section Roman numeral 4
 
02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
c number
 
02:47:47.230 --> 02:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
five way down at the bottom hand count
 
02:47:51.950 --> 02:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
of ballots cast required I'm not sure
 
02:47:55.150 --> 02:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
what you're referring to because if
 
02:47:58.309 --> 02:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
you're referring to in the moderators
 
02:48:01.469 --> 02:48:01.479 align:start position:0%
worksheet that we use now in part
 
02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
two uh in under votes and contests no no
 
02:48:07.590 --> 02:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
I'm reading the wrong thing
 
02:48:11.550 --> 02:48:11.560 align:start position:0%
sorry in part C voter participation
 
02:48:15.910 --> 02:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
tallied it no sorry it's a different one
 
02:48:21.070 --> 02:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
um okay in part D you may oh there this
 
02:48:25.750 --> 02:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
this form is so complicated it is part D
 
02:48:28.790 --> 02:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
it says you may hand count the total
 
02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
number of ballots cast do I think that's
 
02:48:33.750 --> 02:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
not for hand count towns that's
 
02:48:37.510 --> 02:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
for you know any towns including voting
 
02:48:40.590 --> 02:48:40.600 align:start position:0%
machine towns it says you may hand count
 
02:48:43.030 --> 02:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
the total number of ballots
 
02:48:46.550 --> 02:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
cast but in your
 
02:48:49.630 --> 02:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
Bill you're saying hand count of ballots
 
02:48:53.309 --> 02:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
cast is required did you mean
 
02:48:57.269 --> 02:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
to um yeah see there's another yeah
 
02:49:01.550 --> 02:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
because that is um option for this and I
 
02:49:03.950 --> 02:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
think that's what I clarified also for
 
02:49:07.630 --> 02:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
um machine count cities and towns only
 
02:49:13.110 --> 02:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
um that I added to that section um
 
02:49:15.950 --> 02:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:49:18.150 --> 02:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so the required should probably be
 
02:49:21.349 --> 02:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
removed I'm not sure why that is there
 
02:49:25.550 --> 02:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
okay because that is that is the um that
 
02:49:27.229 --> 02:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
is the option but just for the city and
 
02:49:30.070 --> 02:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
town section because in portion in
 
02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
section four you have your towns only
 
02:49:35.110 --> 02:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
that do hand count and then on the right
 
02:49:37.710 --> 02:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
of that is machine count City towns only
 
02:49:41.269 --> 02:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that section five
 
02:49:42.910 --> 02:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
is if they
 
02:49:45.349 --> 02:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
um hand count the total number of
 
02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
ballots cast that you may hand count um
 
02:49:53.870 --> 02:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
so should they need to that would that's
 
02:49:56.750 --> 02:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
where it would go okay because there's
 
02:49:59.190 --> 02:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
additional so some ballots uh are kicked
 
02:50:00.950 --> 02:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
out of the machine you need to kick you
 
02:50:02.389 --> 02:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
or they're right in and you have to
 
02:50:03.750 --> 02:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
count those so that's where that would
 
02:50:07.550 --> 02:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
go okay um I have a follow-up question
 
02:50:09.870 --> 02:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
yes as long as everybody's good yep yeah
 
02:50:13.469 --> 02:50:13.479 align:start position:0%
all right so this is you probably have
 
02:50:17.269 --> 02:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
um you want you want the test ballots to
 
02:50:26.790 --> 02:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
be counted and
 
02:50:30.790 --> 02:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
in Port Portsmouth we've got five Wards
 
02:50:33.150 --> 02:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
and the city
 
02:50:35.710 --> 02:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
clerk test you know tests the machines
 
02:50:38.150 --> 02:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
with the test ballots ahead of time so
 
02:50:41.469 --> 02:50:41.479 align:start position:0%
we never we we the people out in the in
 
02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
the wards
 
02:50:45.550 --> 02:50:45.560 align:start position:0%
working uh don't ever see the test
 
02:50:48.670 --> 02:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
ballots so that's me just adding one
 
02:50:52.309 --> 02:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
extra step complicating things that we
 
02:50:54.269 --> 02:50:54.279 align:start position:0%
don't we we don't even know how many
 
02:50:56.269 --> 02:50:56.279 align:start position:0%
test ballots there were I guess the city
 
02:50:58.790 --> 02:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
clerk would have to tell us that right
 
02:51:00.150 --> 02:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
and I believe the city clerk is
 
02:51:03.070 --> 02:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
available that day
 
02:51:05.830 --> 02:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
correct not in all Wards well she floats
 
02:51:07.750 --> 02:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
around to the different
 
02:51:11.349 --> 02:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
Wards yeah so why I guess my question is
 
02:51:12.830 --> 02:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
why do you want the test ballots
 
02:51:15.349 --> 02:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
included why is that important in the
 
02:51:17.950 --> 02:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
reconciliation so great question it's
 
02:51:20.510 --> 02:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's an inventory it's a ballot that's
 
02:51:22.389 --> 02:51:22.399 align:start position:0%
there so we want to make sure that we're
 
02:51:24.190 --> 02:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
counting all
 
02:51:26.950 --> 02:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
ballots that's
 
02:51:26.960 --> 02:51:28.990 align:start position:0%
ballots that's
all

02:51:28.990 --> 02:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:51:31.710 --> 02:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
sure the committee oh there you go
 
02:51:34.790 --> 02:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you um I
 
02:51:37.950 --> 02:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
seem to recall having a bill perhaps
 
02:51:41.710 --> 02:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
last week where the Secretary of State
 
02:51:43.630 --> 02:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
um or deputy secretary of state I can't
 
02:51:45.710 --> 02:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
remember which one went
 
02:51:48.950 --> 02:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
through the entire inventory
 
02:51:51.150 --> 02:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
process um
 
02:51:55.349 --> 02:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
that they do to make sure that ballots
 
02:51:57.229 --> 02:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
are tracked
 
02:52:01.269 --> 02:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
responsibly um and accounted for
 
02:52:05.870 --> 02:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately and I'm wondering
 
02:52:09.870 --> 02:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
if what this bill is trying to do
 
02:52:13.309 --> 02:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
conflicts with the inventory protocols
 
02:52:15.630 --> 02:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
that the Secretary of State office
 
02:52:19.389 --> 02:52:19.399 align:start position:0%
currently maintains sure great question
 
02:52:23.110 --> 02:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
um so it's just a process of chain of
 
02:52:25.349 --> 02:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
custody so the
 
02:52:27.990 --> 02:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
clerk or clerks I don't know how many
 
02:52:30.670 --> 02:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
are available their office counts all
 
02:52:33.269 --> 02:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
the ballots when they receive them so
 
02:52:35.710 --> 02:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
they're all accounted they're sorted and
 
02:52:38.910 --> 02:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
they're put back in the boxes prior um
 
02:52:40.030 --> 02:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
before the
 
02:52:42.550 --> 02:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
elections this is just kind of taking
 
02:52:44.630 --> 02:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
that information and and putting it all
 
02:52:46.229 --> 02:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
there so we're tracking the actual
 
02:52:49.870 --> 02:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
inventory of the ballot in the process
 
02:52:54.910 --> 02:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:54.920 --> 02:52:58.750 align:start position:0%
 
night

02:52:58.750 --> 02:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:03.510 --> 02:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
please is there currently a problem that
 
02:53:06.309 --> 02:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
actually needs to be resolved that this
 
02:53:10.510 --> 02:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to correct
 
02:53:13.070 --> 02:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
or um is
 
02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
this oh I'll I'll just leave it at that
 
02:53:17.590 --> 02:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
is there a problem that this bill is
 
02:53:19.030 --> 02:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
02:53:19.040 --> 02:53:20.710 align:start position:0%
trying to
correct

02:53:20.710 --> 02:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:53:24.510 --> 02:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't see I I don't know of um
 
02:53:27.110 --> 02:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
specific ones but it is just a tracking
 
02:53:30.830 --> 02:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
of ballots and and um from some of the
 
02:53:34.110 --> 02:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
issues that we've seen uh in other towns
 
02:53:36.110 --> 02:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
there are some that are un
 
02:53:38.630 --> 02:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
unaccounted so it would just be
 
02:53:38.640 --> 02:53:39.730 align:start position:0%
unaccounted so it would just be
providing

02:53:39.730 --> 02:53:39.740 align:start position:0%
providing
 
02:53:39.740 --> 02:53:41.910 align:start position:0%
providing
[Music]

02:53:41.910 --> 02:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:53:44.950 --> 02:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
um uh secured um
 
02:53:46.830 --> 02:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
ballots and inventory making sure that
 
02:53:48.670 --> 02:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
they're all accounted from the beginning
 
02:53:50.030 --> 02:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
until the end of the
 
02:53:54.630 --> 02:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:56.590 --> 02:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
we just
 
02:53:59.790 --> 02:53:59.800 align:start position:0%
clarify um so the moderator's checklist
 
02:54:05.389 --> 02:54:05.399 align:start position:0%
on page 423 of our election procedures
 
02:54:09.269 --> 02:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
manual um there's a sample work sheet
 
02:54:12.429 --> 02:54:12.439 align:start position:0%
there and then that corresponds
 
02:54:16.950 --> 02:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
to uh RSA 6 5973 which is the general
 
02:54:20.469 --> 02:54:20.479 align:start position:0%
content of return and that lists out
 
02:54:22.630 --> 02:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
which votes or which ballots are to be
 
02:54:27.429 --> 02:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
counted and stuff so a lot of this
 
02:54:32.910 --> 02:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
um bill is trying to harmonize and align
 
02:54:36.510 --> 02:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
the RSA with the actual election
 
02:54:40.070 --> 02:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
law manual worksheet is that correct yes
 
02:54:41.870 --> 02:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:54:46.630 --> 02:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
correct thank you as representative
 
02:54:50.229 --> 02:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
HR you describe what
 
02:54:54.670 --> 02:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
a um test ballot
 
02:54:57.550 --> 02:54:57.560 align:start position:0%
is so there are extra ballots that are
 
02:55:02.710 --> 02:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
given um along with the um ballots for
 
02:55:05.950 --> 02:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
election day specifically to test the
 
02:55:08.590 --> 02:55:08.600 align:start position:0%
machines prior to the
 
02:55:10.990 --> 02:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
election and they're accounted for and
 
02:55:13.190 --> 02:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
then they're put back into the
 
02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:16.910 align:start position:0%
then they're put back into the
box

02:55:16.910 --> 02:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:19.910 --> 02:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
followup yep represent Hammer thank you
 
02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
um so they're put back into what
 
02:55:27.670 --> 02:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
boooks um that I'm not sure that's uh
 
02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's uh I'm I'm I'm I it may be the
 
02:55:33.630 --> 02:55:33.640 align:start position:0%
folder they came in I think I'm not sure
 
02:55:36.309 --> 02:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
which process the test ballots come back
 
02:55:38.670 --> 02:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
in or how they arrived maybe somebody
 
02:55:40.630 --> 02:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
else might know but
 
02:55:40.640 --> 02:55:43.190 align:start position:0%
else might know but
um

02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:47.790 align:start position:0%
um
sorry

02:55:47.790 --> 02:55:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:52.990 --> 02:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:55.349 --> 02:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
um trying to phrase this as a question
 
02:55:59.630 --> 02:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
so I I have seen um the Hudson moderator
 
02:56:01.309 --> 02:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh take the test ballots run them
 
02:56:03.070 --> 02:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
through the machine according to the
 
02:56:05.429 --> 02:56:05.439 align:start position:0%
protocol and then package them up in
 
02:56:07.670 --> 02:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
their own separate box appropriately
 
02:56:10.389 --> 02:56:10.399 align:start position:0%
labeled in that way would that sound uh
 
02:56:13.070 --> 02:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
similar to what goes on in your town yes
 
02:56:15.309 --> 02:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
I just wasn't sure if it in a box or in
 
02:56:17.790 --> 02:56:17.800 align:start position:0%
an envelope so I do know they go back
 
02:56:20.030 --> 02:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
into some type of
 
02:56:26.830 --> 02:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:29.710 --> 02:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
raer have you consulted with moderators
 
02:56:31.070 --> 02:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
and are they comfortable with the
 
02:56:34.070 --> 02:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
revisions to this yes well I've
 
02:56:36.510 --> 02:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
consulted with mine because I see how
 
02:56:40.150 --> 02:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
distru he is every time and um I I would
 
02:56:42.429 --> 02:56:42.439 align:start position:0%
like to hear from others as well um I
 
02:56:44.110 --> 02:56:44.120 align:start position:0%
just know that this has been an ongoing
 
02:56:46.870 --> 02:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
issue with um you know when you're if
 
02:56:48.950 --> 02:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to have inventory you want
 
02:56:51.110 --> 02:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
the numbers to balance out at the end
 
02:56:53.110 --> 02:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
and it has not been happening for the
 
02:56:55.269 --> 02:56:55.279 align:start position:0%
most part and sometimes it's just off by
 
02:56:57.229 --> 02:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit and sometimes it's off by a
 
02:57:01.229 --> 02:57:01.239 align:start position:0%
lot um I I when we were drafting this
 
02:57:03.229 --> 02:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
and constituents that I was working with
 
02:57:05.550 --> 02:57:05.560 align:start position:0%
they they had copies of the checklist
 
02:57:08.030 --> 02:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
from their towns and cities and they
 
02:57:10.349 --> 02:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
were some of them were off by a lot and
 
02:57:12.590 --> 02:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
so how does that happen it should be a
 
02:57:16.229 --> 02:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
simple process and I'm trying to provide
 
02:57:19.309 --> 02:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
that in this work this new revised
 
02:57:22.070 --> 02:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
worksheet because um sometimes as we've
 
02:57:24.590 --> 02:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
heard today ballots are added they just
 
02:57:26.830 --> 02:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
because we the towns and cities receive
 
02:57:29.110 --> 02:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
them there's other methods of them being
 
02:57:32.710 --> 02:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
added in that day um and so we just want
 
02:57:35.469 --> 02:57:35.479 align:start position:0%
accountability for those as
 
02:57:37.469 --> 02:57:37.479 align:start position:0%
well we're going to do last question
 
02:57:40.429 --> 02:57:40.439 align:start position:0%
here so representative where so we heard
 
02:57:43.750 --> 02:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
dep deputy secretary Hennessy talk about
 
02:57:45.910 --> 02:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
how how challenging sometimes getting
 
02:57:49.269 --> 02:57:49.279 align:start position:0%
the accurate count is and the concerns
 
02:57:51.190 --> 02:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
about labeling that as
 
02:57:53.670 --> 02:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
non-compliance um would you think that
 
02:57:56.229 --> 02:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
this moderator's worksheet that is now
 
02:58:00.510 --> 02:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
aligned with the RSA would in fact
 
02:58:02.229 --> 02:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
reduce the possibility or the
 
02:58:04.910 --> 02:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
probability of calculation errors
 
02:58:07.309 --> 02:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
because there's a fuller accountability
 
02:58:09.990 --> 02:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
and Reconciliation of the ballots being
 
02:58:12.229 --> 02:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
provided to the town or city
 
02:58:15.710 --> 02:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
Ward is definitely the goal and I'm sure
 
02:58:19.349 --> 02:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
with just a couple more um edits and the
 
02:58:21.469 --> 02:58:21.479 align:start position:0%
amendment will'll be I think we'll be
 
02:58:24.710 --> 02:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
really in good shape for for the next
 
02:58:27.630 --> 02:58:27.640 align:start position:0%
run with these um worksheets that is the
 
02:58:29.229 --> 02:58:29.239 align:start position:0%
goal thank you okay thank you
 
02:58:31.349 --> 02:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
representative vernham uh only under one
 
02:58:33.870 --> 02:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
card is uh for deputy secretary of state
 
02:58:36.590 --> 02:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
Aaron Hennessy um represent you grab
 
02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:42.920 --> 02:58:56.110 align:start position:0%
 
me

02:58:56.110 --> 02:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:59.229 --> 02:58:59.239 align:start position:0%
Erin Hennessy deputy secretary of state
 
02:59:01.269 --> 02:59:01.279 align:start position:0%
um I just want to start out with I
 
02:59:02.950 --> 02:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
applaud anyone who wants to talk about
 
02:59:06.510 --> 02:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
reconciliations as an accountant um my
 
02:59:09.870 --> 02:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
fear is that the way this is currently
 
02:59:13.389 --> 02:59:13.399 align:start position:0%
drafted um it it increases the
 
02:59:15.870 --> 02:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
complication of the process and we will
 
02:59:19.750 --> 02:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
get more errors um versus um our goal in
 
02:59:22.229 --> 02:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
our office is to simplify the process to
 
02:59:25.070 --> 02:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
make sure its accuracy and transparency
 
02:59:30.309 --> 02:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
is correct um there's several instances
 
02:59:31.950 --> 02:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
that were not brought up I'm not going
 
02:59:33.469 --> 02:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
to discuss every anything that the
 
02:59:36.229 --> 02:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
committee has already spoken about but
 
02:59:38.870 --> 02:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
um we like to see and I know that um
 
02:59:40.469 --> 02:59:40.479 align:start position:0%
especially when the committee takes a
 
02:59:44.110 --> 02:59:44.120 align:start position:0%
look at 664 we just want to see um
 
02:59:47.229 --> 02:59:47.239 align:start position:0%
consistent language throughout a um
 
02:59:50.429 --> 02:59:50.439 align:start position:0%
throughout the process so changing um
 
02:59:53.389 --> 02:59:53.399 align:start position:0%
official ballot to election day Ballot
 
02:59:56.070 --> 02:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
or in here it's also referred to General
 
02:59:59.030 --> 02:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
ballot um which has a diff very specific
 
03:00:00.910 --> 03:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
and different meanings um we want to
 
03:00:02.110 --> 03:00:02.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that the language is
 
03:00:04.950 --> 03:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
consistent throughout um out the
 
03:00:08.110 --> 03:00:08.120 align:start position:0%
election chapter so that when a um
 
03:00:10.190 --> 03:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
moderator is actually reconciling they
 
03:00:11.590 --> 03:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
know exactly what they're supposed to be
 
03:00:13.309 --> 03:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
putting in here so there's a lot of
 
03:00:13.319 --> 03:00:14.309 align:start position:0%
putting in here so there's a lot of
consens

03:00:14.309 --> 03:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
consens
 
03:00:16.309 --> 03:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies as it's written
 
03:00:20.110 --> 03:00:20.120 align:start position:0%
currently um one weird thing is that it
 
03:00:21.950 --> 03:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
takes out the moderator's signature for
 
03:00:24.190 --> 03:00:24.200 align:start position:0%
some reason on the moderator's uh
 
03:00:27.070 --> 03:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
worksheet instead of um and ads the
 
03:00:30.269 --> 03:00:30.279 align:start position:0%
clerk has to sign it and one supervisor
 
03:00:32.429 --> 03:00:32.439 align:start position:0%
of the checklist has to sign it so just
 
03:00:35.790 --> 03:00:35.800 align:start position:0%
things in here we when we make changes
 
03:00:37.349 --> 03:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
broadly like this to try and help
 
03:00:39.389 --> 03:00:39.399 align:start position:0%
improve the process I I like to look at
 
03:00:41.990 --> 03:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
every single word um and I know it's
 
03:00:44.229 --> 03:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
difficult because the way um
 
03:00:46.750 --> 03:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
it was drafted it's a replace all and so
 
03:00:48.429 --> 03:00:48.439 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to see what has
 
03:00:52.510 --> 03:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
changed in in the language um but I'm um
 
03:00:53.590 --> 03:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to work with the
 
03:00:56.190 --> 03:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
representative to Fig see if there's a
 
03:00:58.510 --> 03:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
um more simplified version that would
 
03:01:02.429 --> 03:01:02.439 align:start position:0%
get to the end that she's looking at um
 
03:01:04.150 --> 03:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
also I just want to point out um having
 
03:01:07.229 --> 03:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
just sat through the last bill um we do
 
03:01:09.990 --> 03:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
not separate out
 
03:01:12.990 --> 03:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
um ballots that have been have gone
 
03:01:15.590 --> 03:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
through an excess ible voting machine
 
03:01:17.349 --> 03:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
those are official ballots that are fed
 
03:01:20.229 --> 03:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
into the printer and the voters um votes
 
03:01:22.429 --> 03:01:22.439 align:start position:0%
are marked on there for the sole purpose
 
03:01:25.830 --> 03:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
of making that um vote of that um
 
03:01:28.550 --> 03:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
individual voter um private so we would
 
03:01:30.910 --> 03:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
not ever want to put those aside or mark
 
03:01:33.950 --> 03:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
them any differently um just to maintain
 
03:01:37.710 --> 03:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
their secret ballot I'm happy to take
 
03:01:39.309 --> 03:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:01:39.319 --> 03:01:40.990 align:start position:0%

03:01:52.990 --> 03:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
resolve thank you for the question no I
 
03:01:56.309 --> 03:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:56.319 --> 03:02:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
Nowa

03:02:01.830 --> 03:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:05.190 --> 03:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
Lane um to get back to representative
 
03:02:09.469 --> 03:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
Hamlet's question where in cities the
 
03:02:12.670 --> 03:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
clerk will test the machines and then
 
03:02:15.830 --> 03:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
they go to the Awards so there's no test
 
03:02:18.229 --> 03:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
ballots by those
 
03:02:21.750 --> 03:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
moderators is is am I miss so but this
 
03:02:24.190 --> 03:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
seems to require test
 
03:02:27.550 --> 03:02:27.560 align:start position:0%
ballots and and there aren't
 
03:02:29.950 --> 03:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
any thank thank you for the question the
 
03:02:33.550 --> 03:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
test ballots are separate and
 
03:02:37.269 --> 03:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
um in cities the city clerks do a lot of
 
03:02:38.710 --> 03:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
the work and it's a little different
 
03:02:41.590 --> 03:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
than the town process but in general the
 
03:02:44.030 --> 03:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
test ballots which are 50 of them um
 
03:02:47.110 --> 03:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
which you can use 35 of the test ballots
 
03:02:49.590 --> 03:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
that we've sent and 15 absente D ballots
 
03:02:52.030 --> 03:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
if you wish to substitute out those to
 
03:02:54.150 --> 03:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
test in a different way but those are
 
03:02:56.389 --> 03:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
put back in the envelope they came in
 
03:02:58.670 --> 03:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
and they're put in the side pocket of
 
03:03:02.269 --> 03:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
the device um so that when the um
 
03:03:05.349 --> 03:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
moderator opens up the ward or or
 
03:03:08.150 --> 03:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
polling place they can um see evidence
 
03:03:10.030 --> 03:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
that the long tape's in there from the
 
03:03:12.070 --> 03:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
test process that it was actually tested
 
03:03:13.990 --> 03:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
before they put the device
 
03:03:16.229 --> 03:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
into use for the day um also when the
 
03:03:18.269 --> 03:03:18.279 align:start position:0%
AG's Department comes to look they can
 
03:03:20.910 --> 03:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
see that the device was properly tested
 
03:03:22.790 --> 03:03:22.800 align:start position:0%

often hear testimony from people about
 
04:03:14.149 --> 04:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
these matters and several bills this

year have claimed to be solutions for
 
04:03:18.590 --> 04:03:18.600 align:start position:0%

increasing the accuracy of voter roles
 
04:03:23.910 --> 04:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
here's some good news we can accomplish
 
04:03:26.790 --> 04:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
these shared goals by passing this bill
 
04:03:30.550 --> 04:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
to join the only proven reliable
 
04:03:33.309 --> 04:03:33.319 align:start position:0%

04:03:41.269 --> 04:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
moving both within our state and to
 
04:03:44.149 --> 04:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
other Eric member states allowing for
 
04:03:46.030 --> 04:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
election officials to clean our
 
04:03:49.110 --> 04:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
checklist after every
 
04:03:51.830 --> 04:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
election and quickly identify any
 
04:03:54.030 --> 04:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
possible instances of suspected voter
 
04:03:56.229 --> 04:03:56.239 align:start position:0%

04:04:18.309 --> 04:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
quickly by identifying voters who have
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
moved in or out of state or passed away
 
04:04:23.990 --> 04:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
we can be confident our voter checklists
 
04:04:24.000 --> 04:04:24.870 align:start position:0%
we can be confident our voter checklists
are

04:04:24.870 --> 04:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:04:27.429 --> 04:04:27.439 align:start position:0%
clean this bill if passed requires a
 
04:04:29.309 --> 04:04:29.319 align:start position:0%
secretary to enter into a membership
 
04:04:31.229 --> 04:04:31.239 align:start position:0%
agreement effective no later than
 
04:04:33.149 --> 04:04:33.159 align:start position:0%
January 31
 
04:04:36.030 --> 04:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
2025 which gives plenty of time to
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
review membership requirements um and
 
04:04:41.429 --> 04:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
begin that process which is an easy one
 
04:04:43.149 --> 04:04:43.159 align:start position:0%
um the bill says that funding shall be
 
04:04:45.189 --> 04:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
provided by any federal funds for the
 
04:04:47.870 --> 04:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
purposes of election related expenses
 
04:04:51.269 --> 04:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
including help America vote act dollars
 
04:04:55.349 --> 04:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
which we know that we have plenty of um
 
04:04:57.750 --> 04:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
Eric requires a one-time membership fee
 
04:04:57.760 --> 04:04:59.070 align:start position:0%
Eric requires a one-time membership fee
of

04:04:59.070 --> 04:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:05:01.550 --> 04:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
$25,000 um and then there are annual
 
04:05:06.349 --> 04:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
dues that are related to the um voter
 
04:05:08.630 --> 04:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
population of each state
 
04:05:10.389 --> 04:05:10.399 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire is on the lower
 
04:05:13.189 --> 04:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
end of the spectrum um the beginning
 
04:05:14.990 --> 04:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
amount is about
 
04:05:17.750 --> 04:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
$377,000 and that is an annual fee
 
04:05:19.590 --> 04:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
certainly we can afford that to make
 
04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
sure that our elections are secure and
 
04:05:27.790 --> 04:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
accurate and funded by federal
 
04:05:31.550 --> 04:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
dollars um I have provided you a letter
 
04:05:35.070 --> 04:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
that has been sent by secretaries of
 
04:05:37.149 --> 04:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
state and top election officials from
 
04:05:39.910 --> 04:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
across the country who are members of
 
04:05:45.349 --> 04:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
Eric and they have found that this is um
 
04:05:47.070 --> 04:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
the most
 
04:05:49.870 --> 04:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
important organization
 
04:05:52.550 --> 04:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
nonprofit um that has kept their voter
 
04:05:52.560 --> 04:05:54.229 align:start position:0%
nonprofit um that has kept their voter
roles

04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
roles
 
04:05:57.070 --> 04:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
accurate um they are eager for New
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to join Eric because the more
 
04:06:02.429 --> 04:06:02.439 align:start position:0%
states that are involved the more
 
04:06:05.349 --> 04:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
effective Eric can be for all member
 
04:06:08.990 --> 04:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
states I've also provided information
 
04:06:11.870 --> 04:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
about the technology and security used
 
04:06:14.510 --> 04:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
this is a very secure system it has been
 
04:06:16.670 --> 04:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
around for over 10 years there has not
 
04:06:20.590 --> 04:06:20.600 align:start position:0%
been one instance of um data breach in
 
04:06:20.600 --> 04:06:21.389 align:start position:0%
been one instance of um data breach in
that

04:06:21.389 --> 04:06:21.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:06:25.110 --> 04:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
time there are states who have left Eric
 
04:06:26.149 --> 04:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:06:28.910 --> 04:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
true but some of those are actually
 
04:06:31.510 --> 04:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
looking to return to Eric because they
 
04:06:35.030 --> 04:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
found that in their desire to create a
 
04:06:37.389 --> 04:06:37.399 align:start position:0%
system similar to Eric that operates
 
04:06:40.189 --> 04:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
Within their own State they are have
 
04:06:43.149 --> 04:06:43.159 align:start position:0%
failed to do so they cannot match the
 
04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
security and accuracy provided by the
 
04:06:49.349 --> 04:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
Eric data
 
04:06:52.750 --> 04:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
collection um there are states that are
 
04:06:54.630 --> 04:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
looking to get back into Eric which
 
04:06:56.070 --> 04:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
means they have to pay the membership
 
04:06:58.590 --> 04:06:58.600 align:start position:0%
fee again so they have realized their
 
04:07:01.750 --> 04:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
mistake and they want back in we also
 
04:07:03.790 --> 04:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
know that there are several states that
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
we anticipate will be joining Eric this
 
04:07:10.790 --> 04:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
year creating again a more effective
 
04:07:14.070 --> 04:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
system completely governed and funded by
 
04:07:14.080 --> 04:07:15.070 align:start position:0%
system completely governed and funded by
those

04:07:15.070 --> 04:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:07:17.469 --> 04:07:17.479 align:start position:0%
States um we
 
04:07:22.349 --> 04:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
have heard some hesitation about linking
 
04:07:24.790 --> 04:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of Motor Vehicle records
 
04:07:26.830 --> 04:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
and the Secretary of State and voter
 
04:07:30.830 --> 04:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
records um I have to admit I
 
04:07:33.070 --> 04:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
find that a bit
 
04:07:35.750 --> 04:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
frustrating that um there may be some
 
04:07:37.750 --> 04:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
who don't want communication between our
 
04:07:39.429 --> 04:07:39.439 align:start position:0%
our different Departments of the state
 
04:07:41.990 --> 04:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's just as frustrating to me as when a
 
04:07:44.630 --> 04:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
a town board and a school board fail to
 
04:07:46.630 --> 04:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
communicate you're all serving the same
 
04:07:50.630 --> 04:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
people uh increased communication serves
 
04:07:55.229 --> 04:07:55.239 align:start position:0%
the people better so uh I completely do
 
04:07:58.389 --> 04:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
not believe that argument that the DMV
 
04:08:01.070 --> 04:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
and the voter files or Secretary of
 
04:08:02.830 --> 04:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
State's office should not
 
04:08:06.510 --> 04:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
communicate I I will add that this is
 
04:08:08.830 --> 04:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
and emphasize that this is a
 
04:08:13.269 --> 04:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
bipartisan um system it is um supported
 
04:08:16.229 --> 04:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
by a variety of States 25 including the
 
04:08:18.910 --> 04:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
state of Georgia um Secretary of State
 
04:08:21.309 --> 04:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
Brad raffensberger says maintaining
 
04:08:23.070 --> 04:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
accurate voter roles protects the
 
04:08:25.750 --> 04:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
Integrity of our elections systems like
 
04:08:28.149 --> 04:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
Eric are an important tool for election
 
04:08:30.109 --> 04:08:30.119 align:start position:0%
administrators and help prevent people
 
04:08:32.229 --> 04:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
from being registered in and trying to
 
04:08:35.349 --> 04:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
vote in multiple States states that
 
04:08:38.990 --> 04:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
prioritize best practices and actual
 
04:08:41.950 --> 04:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
election Integrity over politics are
 
04:08:44.870 --> 04:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
going to stay in Eric and have clearer
 
04:08:47.670 --> 04:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
and more accurate voter roles than those
 
04:08:50.590 --> 04:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:52.990 --> 04:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
leave we all know that election
 
04:08:55.590 --> 04:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
integrity and voter confidence is a high
 
04:08:58.429 --> 04:08:58.439 align:start position:0%
priority for this committee for many
 
04:09:00.990 --> 04:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
members who have come and spoken to our
 
04:09:02.990 --> 04:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
committee before and for the Secretary
 
04:09:06.830 --> 04:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
of State as well um and it is supported
 
04:09:09.389 --> 04:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
joining Eric would be supported by the
 
04:09:11.830 --> 04:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
committee on voter confidence because
 
04:09:13.750 --> 04:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
increasing the accuracy of our voter
 
04:09:16.109 --> 04:09:16.119 align:start position:0%
roles or voter checklist was a high
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
priority finding out of that committee
 
04:09:19.910 --> 04:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
on voter
 
04:09:22.070 --> 04:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
confidence um some people may be
 
04:09:24.510 --> 04:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about security as I mentioned
 
04:09:27.910 --> 04:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
Eric has never been victim of um
 
04:09:31.189 --> 04:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
hacking and that's important because
 
04:09:32.670 --> 04:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
states that are trying to create their
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
own system can't match the security of
 
04:09:36.520 --> 04:09:38.389 align:start position:0%
own system can't match the security of
ER

04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
ER
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
um Eric distributes to each member an
 
04:09:42.550 --> 04:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
application that applies a cryptographic
 
04:09:45.309 --> 04:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
one-way hash to sensitive data elements
 
04:09:47.229 --> 04:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
before the jurisdiction submits the data
 
04:09:49.910 --> 04:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
to Eric this Eric hashing application
 
04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
uses a module provided by IBM in
 
04:09:53.990 --> 04:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
conjunction with sensing which
 
04:09:57.429 --> 04:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
implements a very complicated one-way
 
04:10:02.189 --> 04:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:06.590 --> 04:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
key you cannot a no one can access this
 
04:10:11.189 --> 04:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
data except for the designated member of
 
04:10:15.109 --> 04:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
the designated member state of
 
04:10:17.710 --> 04:10:17.720 align:start position:0%
Eric the hashing application converts
 
04:10:19.830 --> 04:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
these data into what appears to be a
 
04:10:22.469 --> 04:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
string of random characters making the
 
04:10:24.750 --> 04:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
data significantly more difficult for a
 
04:10:27.710 --> 04:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
potential hacker to
 
04:10:31.189 --> 04:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
utilize we take our elections here
 
04:10:34.469 --> 04:10:34.479 align:start position:0%
seriously the security of our elections
 
04:10:38.070 --> 04:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
is Paramount Eric increases is that
 
04:10:40.870 --> 04:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
security of our
 
04:10:44.670 --> 04:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
elections any state that is serious
 
04:10:49.070 --> 04:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
about efficient safe accurate secure
 
04:10:52.710 --> 04:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
elections is a member state of Eric it's
 
04:10:55.950 --> 04:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
time for us to join our neighbors all of
 
04:10:58.429 --> 04:10:58.439 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states that are members
 
04:11:00.950 --> 04:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
of Eric and States across the country
 
04:11:02.790 --> 04:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
that are members of Erica it's time to
 
04:11:06.630 --> 04:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
join them and say to our constituents
 
04:11:09.910 --> 04:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
that we Val value our elections now I
 
04:11:12.830 --> 04:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
have heard that there has been
 
04:11:15.950 --> 04:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
some hesitation or concern about one
 
04:11:18.510 --> 04:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
component of Eric that requires Outreach
 
04:11:22.030 --> 04:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
to likely eligible but unregistered
 
04:11:24.790 --> 04:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
voters this is a membership requirement
 
04:11:29.149 --> 04:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
yes but the state gets to determine how
 
04:11:33.550 --> 04:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
to do that voter Outreach and it simply
 
04:11:37.870 --> 04:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
tells the likely eligible voter how to
 
04:11:40.950 --> 04:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
register to vote when we have our new
 
04:11:43.590 --> 04:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
election information portal it may be
 
04:11:46.309 --> 04:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
simply providing a
 
04:11:49.790 --> 04:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
website we share a goal of increasing
 
04:11:53.030 --> 04:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
our voter participation we should always
 
04:11:55.870 --> 04:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
strive to reach that 100% voter
 
04:11:58.990 --> 04:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
participation could you
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
imagine this voter
 
04:12:05.189 --> 04:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
Outreach does not force anyone to
 
04:12:08.269 --> 04:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
register it does not Target anyone
 
04:12:10.389 --> 04:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
suspected of being a member of any
 
04:12:14.910 --> 04:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
particular party it simply says hey you
 
04:12:18.149 --> 04:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
moved you may not be registered yet but
 
04:12:20.429 --> 04:12:20.439 align:start position:0%
registering is quick and easy just visit
 
04:12:23.389 --> 04:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
your town clerk's office and bring these
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh papers with you and you can sign up
 
04:12:28.309 --> 04:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
or here's our new election information
 
04:12:30.630 --> 04:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
portal website and you can sign up begin
 
04:12:33.149 --> 04:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
that registration process online quick
 
04:12:35.429 --> 04:12:35.439 align:start position:0%
and easy the membership requirement in
 
04:12:38.429 --> 04:12:38.439 align:start position:0%
Eric for this voter Outreach is once
 
04:12:40.030 --> 04:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
every two
 
04:12:42.830 --> 04:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
years this is not a heavy burden is is
 
04:12:44.670 --> 04:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
not a heavy lift for the Secretary of
 
04:12:46.349 --> 04:12:46.359 align:start position:0%
State's office to do this
 
04:12:49.189 --> 04:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
Outreach now there are many states who
 
04:12:52.429 --> 04:12:52.439 align:start position:0%
have found that um doing the Outreach to
 
04:12:55.750 --> 04:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
likely eligible voters is better when
 
04:12:57.590 --> 04:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's done more frequently because you
 
04:12:59.870 --> 04:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
can make sure that your voter checklist
 
04:13:03.149 --> 04:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
is most accurate there are some states
 
04:13:06.229 --> 04:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
that will do it every 60 days there's
 
04:13:09.189 --> 04:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
nothing in the membership agreement that
 
04:13:12.349 --> 04:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
would dictate to the Secretary of State
 
04:13:15.910 --> 04:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
when or how to conduct this Outreach
 
04:13:22.830 --> 04:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:26.870 --> 04:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
years I anticipate that you may have
 
04:13:30.469 --> 04:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
some questions and instead of rambling
 
04:13:32.750 --> 04:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
on I want to thank you for your
 
04:13:35.550 --> 04:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
attention and if you do have questions
 
04:13:42.229 --> 04:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:45.510 --> 04:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
you then
 
04:13:45.520 --> 04:13:47.790 align:start position:0%
you then
we

04:13:47.790 --> 04:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:13:50.510 --> 04:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:13:52.309 --> 04:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
04:13:56.830 --> 04:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
Brennan um just a quick question um on
 
04:13:56.840 --> 04:13:58.109 align:start position:0%
Brennan um just a quick question um on
this

04:13:58.109 --> 04:13:58.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:13:58.119 --> 04:14:00.670 align:start position:0%
this
um

04:14:00.670 --> 04:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:03.309 --> 04:14:03.319 align:start position:0%
so I I want to bring two things in the
 
04:14:05.189 --> 04:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
bill together and try and understand
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
them better so lines 8 and and 15 and 16
 
04:14:12.269 --> 04:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
talk about duplicate voter information
 
04:14:15.349 --> 04:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
and cases of duplicated voter voting
 
04:14:18.030 --> 04:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
record suspected of illegal
 
04:14:21.189 --> 04:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
voting um so that's the first part um
 
04:14:23.990 --> 04:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's also the fiscal note at the end
 
04:14:27.670 --> 04:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
um that talks about a Max of
 
04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
174,000 plus and there are three three
 
04:14:33.750 --> 04:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
pluses here plus the undetermined fiscal
 
04:14:35.710 --> 04:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
impact of data security staffing needs
 
04:14:38.389 --> 04:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
and compliance Plus plus the uncertain
 
04:14:40.229 --> 04:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
financial implications of Staffing and
 
04:14:42.910 --> 04:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
mailing Clause plus additional General
 
04:14:44.870 --> 04:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
funds due to potential
 
04:14:48.030 --> 04:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
expenses so I've heard repeatedly
 
04:14:49.750 --> 04:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
usually in my left ear that our
 
04:14:52.030 --> 04:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
elections are safe and secure and that
 
04:14:54.990 --> 04:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill seems to focus on
 
04:14:57.670 --> 04:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
duplicate voting and I'm just wondering
 
04:14:57.680 --> 04:14:58.630 align:start position:0%
duplicate voting and I'm just wondering
if

04:14:58.630 --> 04:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:15:01.630 --> 04:15:01.640 align:start position:0%
174,000 and plus these undefined
 
04:15:05.910 --> 04:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
undetermined expenses really account for
 
04:15:08.149 --> 04:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
the number of d duplicate of voting
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
records that we're going that we really
 
04:15:12.070 --> 04:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
need to address I mean how many are
 
04:15:14.630 --> 04:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
there are there are there that many that
 
04:15:17.590 --> 04:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
it warrant um that potential
 
04:15:20.149 --> 04:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
expenditure thank you for the question
 
04:15:23.670 --> 04:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
um Eric does track duplicative voter
 
04:15:26.389 --> 04:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
registration it also tracks cross state
 
04:15:30.510 --> 04:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
movers instate updates um duplicative
 
04:15:33.950 --> 04:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
and deceased voters um to make sure that
 
04:15:36.469 --> 04:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
our voter roles are most accurate I know
 
04:15:38.269 --> 04:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
that that is a priority for you and this
 
04:15:40.910 --> 04:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
committee and I think that the expense
 
04:15:43.790 --> 04:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
that the state would need to make um to
 
04:15:46.269 --> 04:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
invest in membership of
 
04:15:50.229 --> 04:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
this um organization or this
 
04:15:52.269 --> 04:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
program far
 
04:15:57.510 --> 04:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:03.630 --> 04:16:03.640 align:start position:0%
cost so um if we look at the uh Eric
 
04:16:06.550 --> 04:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
bylaws from February 23 on page 19 it
 
04:16:08.269 --> 04:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
states there's a mandatory requirement
 
04:16:10.590 --> 04:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
to keep Eric membership and I'll I'll
 
04:16:13.109 --> 04:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
read quote when the member receives Eric
 
04:16:15.269 --> 04:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
data regarding eligible or possible
 
04:16:17.670 --> 04:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
eligible citizens who are not registered
 
04:16:20.269 --> 04:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
to vote the memb shall at a minimum
 
04:16:22.349 --> 04:16:22.359 align:start position:0%
initiate contact with each and every
 
04:16:25.109 --> 04:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
eligible or possibly eligible Citizen
 
04:16:28.229 --> 04:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
and inform them how to register to vote
 
04:16:31.630 --> 04:16:31.640 align:start position:0%
this um this seems like a potential cost
 
04:16:34.349 --> 04:16:34.359 align:start position:0%
um uh each member shall have until
 
04:16:36.630 --> 04:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
October 1st or 15 days before the close
 
04:16:39.309 --> 04:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
of registration whichever is earlier of
 
04:16:41.550 --> 04:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
the next federal general election year
 
04:16:44.830 --> 04:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
to initiate contact with at least 95% of
 
04:16:47.269 --> 04:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
the eligible or potentially eligible
 
04:16:49.790 --> 04:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
citizens on whom data was provided and
 
04:16:51.950 --> 04:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
address validation was performed now
 
04:16:54.469 --> 04:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
just doing some very rough rough math
 
04:16:56.070 --> 04:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
bear with me I'm an engineer I love
 
04:17:00.590 --> 04:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
numbers so but we have 1,400,000 people
 
04:17:03.790 --> 04:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
there were about 800,000 in the 2020
 
04:17:05.349 --> 04:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
presidential election that's probably
 
04:17:08.030 --> 04:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
the max um we won't get more than that
 
04:17:11.550 --> 04:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
on our local or even the midterms if you
 
04:17:15.309 --> 04:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
subtract students um from the educ
 
04:17:18.670 --> 04:17:18.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education 2024 doe numbers
 
04:17:20.910 --> 04:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
that's about you know another 200,000
 
04:17:23.750 --> 04:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
gone um and then just taking as a
 
04:17:26.109 --> 04:17:26.119 align:start position:0%
ballpark figure another 100,000 you're
 
04:17:28.710 --> 04:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
still left with almost 300,000 people
 
04:17:30.590 --> 04:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
whom you would have to initiate contact
 
04:17:33.870 --> 04:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
with that seems like a big mailing
 
04:17:38.269 --> 04:17:38.279 align:start position:0%
expense um so I I'm I have some concerns
 
04:17:40.870 --> 04:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
about these undetermined costs and the
 
04:17:44.349 --> 04:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
mandates that are in the Eric bylaws
 
04:17:46.229 --> 04:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
that would require you to initiate
 
04:17:49.750 --> 04:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
contract this number of people it seems
 
04:17:54.590 --> 04:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
um really quite uh imposing in terms of
 
04:17:56.670 --> 04:17:56.680 align:start position:0%
putting the Secretary of State's office
 
04:17:58.910 --> 04:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
as to having to do all this
 
04:18:02.030 --> 04:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
work was that a question yes it was I
 
04:18:04.710 --> 04:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
mean what you how would you answer that
 
04:18:06.790 --> 04:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um the
 
04:18:09.229 --> 04:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing about the Eric bylaws is
 
04:18:12.910 --> 04:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
they are created by the member states
 
04:18:15.830 --> 04:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
themselves and if we were to enroll in
 
04:18:18.830 --> 04:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
Eric our secretary of state or his
 
04:18:21.750 --> 04:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
design would have a role in determining
 
04:18:25.109 --> 04:18:25.119 align:start position:0%
future bylaws and could potentially make
 
04:18:27.550 --> 04:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
those adjustments um along with the
 
04:18:29.670 --> 04:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
other member states it's also important
 
04:18:32.269 --> 04:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
to know that Eric does not dictate how
 
04:18:34.910 --> 04:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
to go about uh conducting that voter
 
04:18:37.590 --> 04:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
Outreach in fact one of the
 
04:18:40.910 --> 04:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
um one of the pieces of data that can be
 
04:18:43.269 --> 04:18:43.279 align:start position:0%
collected is email addresses and so
 
04:18:46.389 --> 04:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps if the Secretary of State wanted
 
04:18:48.670 --> 04:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
to reduce costs they might do some of
 
04:18:52.389 --> 04:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
the Outreach via email additionally
 
04:18:54.950 --> 04:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's no uh requirement that the
 
04:18:59.229 --> 04:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
mailer must be 10 pages long at a size
 
04:19:03.070 --> 04:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
greater than uh typical sheet of paper
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
in fact it could be a simple postcard it
 
04:19:08.590 --> 04:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
could be at the side of our pink cards
 
04:19:12.349 --> 04:19:12.359 align:start position:0%
um the information is simply how to
 
04:19:15.429 --> 04:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
register to vote and we don't need a lot
 
04:19:18.790 --> 04:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
of information or paper space um to
 
04:19:21.870 --> 04:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
provide that to likely eligible but
 
04:19:24.670 --> 04:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
unregistered voters who we should all
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
want to register to vote and participate
 
04:19:30.189 --> 04:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
in our elections because we take our
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:35.640 --> 04:19:37.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:19:37.510 --> 04:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:19:38.950 --> 04:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
um which is a question Republicans so
 
04:19:43.670 --> 04:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:45.590 --> 04:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
clerk um thank you for taking my
 
04:19:48.469 --> 04:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
question um regarding the uh fellow
 
04:19:51.109 --> 04:19:51.119 align:start position:0%
member states um have they reported any
 
04:19:53.109 --> 04:19:53.119 align:start position:0%
issues with implementation or management
 
04:19:55.030 --> 04:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
of the Eric system and if so how have
 
04:19:57.750 --> 04:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
they addressed those issues there have
 
04:20:00.269 --> 04:20:00.279 align:start position:0%
not been issues any issues that do come
 
04:20:03.309 --> 04:20:03.319 align:start position:0%
up are you know again this is completely
 
04:20:05.950 --> 04:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
governed and run by the member states
 
04:20:08.510 --> 04:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
themselves so problem solving is done
 
04:20:10.670 --> 04:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
within the states and with their fellow
 
04:20:14.349 --> 04:20:14.359 align:start position:0%
member states um it's also important to
 
04:20:18.269 --> 04:20:18.279 align:start position:0%
know we are not doing any of
 
04:20:24.189 --> 04:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
this we are not involved in any checking
 
04:20:27.070 --> 04:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
of data to keep our voter list most
 
04:20:29.389 --> 04:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
accurate we are not involved in any
 
04:20:32.269 --> 04:20:32.279 align:start position:0%
Outreach to likely eligible but
 
04:20:35.309 --> 04:20:35.319 align:start position:0%
unregistered voters this is something we
 
04:20:37.710 --> 04:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
should be doing if we care about our
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
elections if we care about election
 
04:20:41.790 --> 04:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
integrity and voter participation we
 
04:20:47.189 --> 04:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:49.550 --> 04:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
Eric PR
 
04:20:52.990 --> 04:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
Brien thank you Mr chairman where is Ed
 
04:20:56.550 --> 04:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
Eric headquartered right now Eric is
 
04:20:59.990 --> 04:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
made up of member states and so each
 
04:21:03.189 --> 04:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
state is part of Eric they have an
 
04:21:06.109 --> 04:21:06.119 align:start position:0%
office in Washington DC they do not give
 
04:21:08.710 --> 04:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
out the address of that because they
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
want to maintain security um but Eric is
 
04:21:16.630 --> 04:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
member states it is not some Shadow
 
04:21:19.429 --> 04:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
organization it is literally the member
 
04:21:22.670 --> 04:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
states that govern that create the rules
 
04:21:25.990 --> 04:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
that fund the program um and make sure
 
04:21:28.469 --> 04:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
that um you're getting the information
 
04:21:31.229 --> 04:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
that you need
 
04:21:33.109 --> 04:21:33.119 align:start position:0%
followup representative Lane wants to
 
04:21:35.070 --> 04:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
yield for a followup because you were up
 
04:21:36.990 --> 04:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
next representative Lane okay so yes
 
04:21:38.550 --> 04:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
you're good to
 
04:21:41.550 --> 04:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
go it's been a little while since I paid
 
04:21:47.710 --> 04:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:52.189 --> 04:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
Eric but uh some states have joined and
 
04:21:55.149 --> 04:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
then left and do you know anything about
 
04:21:56.389 --> 04:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
that if you don't then maybe some
 
04:21:57.950 --> 04:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
speakers after you would know something
 
04:22:00.149 --> 04:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
about that thank you thank you for the
 
04:22:01.389 --> 04:22:01.399 align:start position:0%
question and I'm sure some other
 
04:22:03.429 --> 04:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
speakers do know um I do have a list of
 
04:22:05.950 --> 04:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
member states and it is true that there
 
04:22:07.710 --> 04:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
have been states that have left the
 
04:22:10.109 --> 04:22:10.119 align:start position:0%
number of member states was higher than
 
04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
it is right now um we know that we are
 
04:22:15.910 --> 04:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
living in very divisive times where the
 
04:22:17.910 --> 04:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
prevalence of disinformation has
 
04:22:20.590 --> 04:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
influenced people um to
 
04:22:24.070 --> 04:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
make one might characterize them as poor
 
04:22:27.429 --> 04:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
decisions in fact states that have left
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
Eric that have sought to create their
 
04:22:32.109 --> 04:22:32.119 align:start position:0%
own system to maintain their voter
 
04:22:34.710 --> 04:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
checklist the most accurate way possible
 
04:22:37.030 --> 04:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
and the most secure way possible
 
04:22:39.189 --> 04:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
have not been able to do that and they
 
04:22:43.469 --> 04:22:43.479 align:start position:0%
are looking to rejoin Eric um because
 
04:22:47.389 --> 04:22:47.399 align:start position:0%
they they miss the value and benefits of
 
04:22:49.950 --> 04:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
being a member state of Eric um I'm
 
04:22:51.670 --> 04:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
happy to provide you with a list of
 
04:22:54.269 --> 04:22:54.279 align:start position:0%
states that currently um our member
 
04:22:55.830 --> 04:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
states in fact I'll read them right off
 
04:22:58.590 --> 04:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
to you Alaska Arizona Colorado

Wisconsin and the District of Colombia
 
04:23:19.670 --> 04:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that all New England
 
04:23:22.550 --> 04:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
states except for New Hampshire are
 
04:23:26.590 --> 04:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
members of Eric and you know also that
 
04:23:29.630 --> 04:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
we experience a lot of people coming and
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
going in New Hampshire there's a lot of
 
04:23:34.269 --> 04:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
moving between the New England states a
 
04:23:36.269 --> 04:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
lot of people that come and go between
 
04:23:38.309 --> 04:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Massachusetts if we
 
04:23:41.710 --> 04:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
ever wanted to catch voting in both
 
04:23:44.070 --> 04:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
States New Hampshire and Massachusetts
 
04:23:47.790 --> 04:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
Eric is the way to catch those voters
 
04:23:50.429 --> 04:23:50.439 align:start position:0%
you know we've heard
 
04:23:54.870 --> 04:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
um wild conspiracy theories about buses
 
04:23:57.030 --> 04:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
of Voters coming up from Massachusetts
 
04:23:59.590 --> 04:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
to vote in New Hampshire elections never
 
04:24:02.870 --> 04:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
proven but the only the way you could is
 
04:24:05.070 --> 04:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
through Eric it would be able to tell
 
04:24:07.149 --> 04:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
you if a voter had voted in both
 
04:24:09.910 --> 04:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and New Hampshire so if
 
04:24:11.710 --> 04:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
that is something that worries you I
 
04:24:15.429 --> 04:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
hope that you would support uh joining
 
04:24:18.790 --> 04:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
Eric representative Lane oh I'm sorry I
 
04:24:21.070 --> 04:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
thought you had your hand up I apologize
 
04:24:23.269 --> 04:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh
 
04:24:26.109 --> 04:24:26.119 align:start position:0%
bay sir chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:24:28.630 --> 04:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
question this question is of interest to
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
me as an
 
04:24:34.590 --> 04:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
immigrant uh does Eric allow for a
 
04:24:39.189 --> 04:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
possibility of uh registering uh new
 
04:24:42.109 --> 04:24:42.119 align:start position:0%
immigrants in theory as soon as they
 
04:24:45.389 --> 04:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
come out of their um oath taking to be
 
04:24:47.670 --> 04:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh new citizens where you can present
 
04:24:51.229 --> 04:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
them with with an online device such an
 
04:24:53.750 --> 04:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
iPad or or or a PC so that they can
 
04:24:57.269 --> 04:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
register to vote just when they became
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
citizens of the United States thank you
 
04:25:01.950 --> 04:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
for the question um Eric does not
 
04:25:04.750 --> 04:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
control voter registration at all it
 
04:25:06.670 --> 04:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
does not um
 
04:25:08.429 --> 04:25:08.439 align:start position:0%
provide voter
 
04:25:11.830 --> 04:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
registration um information the state
 
04:25:14.269 --> 04:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
would be able to provide new immigrants
 
04:25:16.510 --> 04:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
or new Americans with the information
 
04:25:18.870 --> 04:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
needed to get them registered to vote
 
04:25:20.790 --> 04:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
but that would not be within the purview
 
04:25:26.189 --> 04:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:29.429 --> 04:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
you I believe representative barham's up
 
04:25:32.109 --> 04:25:32.119 align:start position:0%
next alternate so you guys know thank
 
04:25:34.229 --> 04:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:25:37.269 --> 04:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
question how can we be certain that uh
 
04:25:40.590 --> 04:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
unfair election Advantage isn't provided
 
04:25:44.030 --> 04:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
to companies who have pre-existing data
 
04:25:44.040 --> 04:25:47.870 align:start position:0%
to companies who have pre-existing data
sharing

04:25:47.870 --> 04:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:50.229 --> 04:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
agreements I'm not sure I quite
 
04:25:53.830 --> 04:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
understand your question there you know
 
04:25:57.030 --> 04:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot uh it speaks about sharing
 
04:25:58.870 --> 04:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
data so how do we not know that they
 
04:26:00.630 --> 04:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
have pre-existing data sharing
 
04:26:04.870 --> 04:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
agreements with other um
 
04:26:09.429 --> 04:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
companies well well again Eric is made
 
04:26:14.070 --> 04:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
up of States not companies there is not
 
04:26:17.030 --> 04:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know some Shadow company taking your
 
04:26:21.229 --> 04:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
data and um manipulating it in any way
 
04:26:24.229 --> 04:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
and so you know I think that's the best
 
04:26:26.189 --> 04:26:26.199 align:start position:0%
way I can answer your question um there
 
04:26:27.830 --> 04:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
may be others who can provide it but
 
04:26:29.189 --> 04:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
I've also provided you with a
 
04:26:31.389 --> 04:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
documentation about the security
 
04:26:35.469 --> 04:26:35.479 align:start position:0%
protocols um that Eric takes seriously
 
04:26:40.510 --> 04:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
um and have been approved by um and
 
04:26:44.590 --> 04:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
evaluated by additional um
 
04:26:44.600 --> 04:26:46.269 align:start position:0%
evaluated by additional um
Security

04:26:46.269 --> 04:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
Security
 
04:26:49.990 --> 04:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
Services uh cyber security firms um to
 
04:26:52.870 --> 04:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
ensure that that Eric has strong data
 
04:26:55.429 --> 04:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
security practices and there have been
 
04:26:57.670 --> 04:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
no critical findings of the way that
 
04:27:01.750 --> 04:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
they manage data which is again managed
 
04:27:04.910 --> 04:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
completely by the states okay thank
 
04:27:04.920 --> 04:27:07.830 align:start position:0%
completely by the states okay thank
you

04:27:07.830 --> 04:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:27:10.950 --> 04:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
rafter thanks for taking my question um
 
04:27:14.750 --> 04:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
could this reduce staff time or expenses
 
04:27:16.670 --> 04:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
that we currently incur to maintain
 
04:27:20.510 --> 04:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
checklists and update them absolutely
 
04:27:22.790 --> 04:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
this would absolutely help our local
 
04:27:24.550 --> 04:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
election officials with the maintenance
 
04:27:26.870 --> 04:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
of the checklist and could certainly
 
04:27:30.070 --> 04:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
have an impact on um costs that
 
04:27:32.070 --> 04:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities face in their voter
 
04:27:34.550 --> 04:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
checklist maintenance um it's also
 
04:27:37.229 --> 04:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
important to notice that that states
 
04:27:39.670 --> 04:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
that are in Eric that have um same day
 
04:27:42.389 --> 04:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
registration like we have here have seen
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
a decrease in the lines on Election Day
 
04:27:47.389 --> 04:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
for registering to vote because of the
 
04:27:51.189 --> 04:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
voter Outreach that is done um to make
 
04:27:53.790 --> 04:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
sure that likely eligible voters know
 
04:27:55.750 --> 04:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
how easy it is to register in advance of
 
04:27:58.189 --> 04:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
an election um that they don't need to
 
04:28:00.149 --> 04:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
register on the same day they can
 
04:28:02.910 --> 04:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:04.750 --> 04:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
advance other questions from the
 
04:28:08.030 --> 04:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:11.389 --> 04:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
you believe in Manchester W 10 we had a
 
04:28:13.590 --> 04:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
voter vote and then this voter went on
 
04:28:17.990 --> 04:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
to neighboring town of gtown and voted
 
04:28:20.950 --> 04:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
with Eric would this might have been
 
04:28:23.510 --> 04:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
stopped would he been stopped from
 
04:28:26.670 --> 04:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
voting again
 
04:28:30.830 --> 04:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
instate Eric does track instate movers
 
04:28:33.550 --> 04:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
and after every election would be able
 
04:28:36.550 --> 04:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
to provide the data necessary and flag
 
04:28:39.149 --> 04:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
this particular transaction to make sure
 
04:28:41.030 --> 04:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
that that person was prosecuted to the
 
04:28:43.269 --> 04:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
fullest extent of the law as
 
04:28:45.389 --> 04:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
investigated um thoroughly by the
 
04:28:50.269 --> 04:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:52.950 --> 04:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
office um further questions from the
 
04:28:55.830 --> 04:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative
 
04:28:58.429 --> 04:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
qua M thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:28:59.990 --> 04:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
04:29:03.070 --> 04:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
question how many states have left Eric
 
04:29:05.229 --> 04:29:05.239 align:start position:0%
and have any of those States actually
 
04:29:08.309 --> 04:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
returned thank you you know off the top
 
04:29:10.309 --> 04:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
of my head I don't know the exact number
 
04:29:12.389 --> 04:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
of seates that have left but I know that
 
04:29:14.870 --> 04:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
currently there are 25 member states
 
04:29:17.229 --> 04:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
with more expected to join this year who
 
04:29:20.670 --> 04:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
have not yet been members of Eric um and
 
04:29:23.469 --> 04:29:23.479 align:start position:0%
there are some who have left and are
 
04:29:26.149 --> 04:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
attempting to return back to
 
04:29:32.950 --> 04:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:34.710 --> 04:29:34.720 align:start position:0%

committee okay uh I have mine and you
 
04:29:38.389 --> 04:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
already probably know what it's going to
 
04:29:43.309 --> 04:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
be um so the state constitution see if I
 
04:29:44.670 --> 04:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
can bring it up here I was flipping
 
04:29:45.710 --> 04:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
through stuff about Eric while I was
 
04:29:49.710 --> 04:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
talking to you um the state constitution
 
04:29:54.830 --> 04:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
has in it a right to privacy so the it's
 
04:29:56.870 --> 04:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
mment 2B so right after 2A which is one
 
04:29:59.189 --> 04:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
of my faves uh but 2B is also one of my
 
04:30:00.910 --> 04:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
favorites passed I think we passed this
 
04:30:03.030 --> 04:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
in 2018 right so it's not exactly not
 
04:30:04.950 --> 04:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
exactly one of those old ones uh an
 
04:30:06.870 --> 04:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
individuals right to live free from
 
04:30:09.189 --> 04:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
governmental intrusion in private or
 
04:30:11.950 --> 04:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
personal information is natural
 
04:30:15.309 --> 04:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent so if we enter
 
04:30:15.319 --> 04:30:16.910 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent so if we enter
into

04:30:16.910 --> 04:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:30:20.070 --> 04:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
Eric some third party is looking at our
 
04:30:22.630 --> 04:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
data via the DMV right that's how it
 
04:30:24.429 --> 04:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
works the DMV data is shared the DMV
 
04:30:25.590 --> 04:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
data is private the voter list is
 
04:30:26.750 --> 04:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
actually not private the voter list is
 
04:30:29.670 --> 04:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
actually public um but how is the
 
04:30:31.750 --> 04:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
sharing of this information even if it's
 
04:30:33.910 --> 04:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
secure even it's with a third party
 
04:30:36.429 --> 04:30:36.439 align:start position:0%
that's blind how is that not a violation
 
04:30:38.510 --> 04:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Constitution's
 
04:30:39.870 --> 04:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
inherent right to privacy which
 
04:30:42.189 --> 04:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
specifically mentions private
 
04:30:44.830 --> 04:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
information the information is not
 
04:30:47.550 --> 04:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
private in fact the information that is
 
04:30:50.189 --> 04:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
evaluated through this data sharing is
 
04:30:53.910 --> 04:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
already with the government name address
 
04:30:56.710 --> 04:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
driver's license number these are all
 
04:30:59.830 --> 04:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
part of governmental records and so I
 
04:31:02.189 --> 04:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
reject the premise that it is violation
 
04:31:04.830 --> 04:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution um we are talking
 
04:31:04.840 --> 04:31:06.630 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution um we are talking
about

04:31:06.630 --> 04:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh specific information that the
 
04:31:12.630 --> 04:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:15.070 --> 04:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
you questions from the
 
04:31:19.349 --> 04:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um next
 
04:31:22.510 --> 04:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
up is Aubrey Friedman may I just add
 
04:31:25.510 --> 04:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
quickly Mr chairman that the voters are
 
04:31:28.830 --> 04:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
on the side of Eric there was a a study
 
04:31:31.670 --> 04:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
done a survey done by St A's just this
 
04:31:34.149 --> 04:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
past November where uh it was found that
 
04:31:38.349 --> 04:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
75% of new New Hampshire voters support
 
04:31:40.670 --> 04:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire joining Eric and I think
 
04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
we should listen to our voters because
 
04:31:44.910 --> 04:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
they know best thank you I hear you I am
 
04:31:47.109 --> 04:31:47.119 align:start position:0%
familiar with that survey I would uh
 
04:31:48.590 --> 04:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
welcome anyone to look at the wording of
 
04:31:52.269 --> 04:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
that survey because I took
 
04:31:55.389 --> 04:31:55.399 align:start position:0%
it um oh actually late entry here I
 
04:31:56.630 --> 04:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
apologize we're going to hold on you
 
04:31:57.830 --> 04:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
because we have the Secretary of State's
 
04:31:59.229 --> 04:31:59.239 align:start position:0%
card just made it to my desk and I like
 
04:32:01.070 --> 04:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
to usually like to bring him in right
 
04:32:02.429 --> 04:32:02.439 align:start position:0%
after the induction of the bill so you
 
04:32:03.870 --> 04:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
will be up next I apologize but I just
 
04:32:10.269 --> 04:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:11.950 --> 04:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:32:14.670 --> 04:32:14.680 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Secretary of State David
 
04:32:16.750 --> 04:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
scanland uh and I want to give you my
 
04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this bill uh first of
 
04:32:22.990 --> 04:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
all the people I've spoken to around the
 
04:32:25.349 --> 04:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
country and secretaries of state's
 
04:32:27.950 --> 04:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
offices have said that this program
 
04:32:30.790 --> 04:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
works well for them I've never heard of
 
04:32:34.870 --> 04:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
anybody speak poorly of it however uh
 
04:32:34.880 --> 04:32:36.710 align:start position:0%
anybody speak poorly of it however uh
recently

04:32:36.710 --> 04:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
recently
 
04:32:39.109 --> 04:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
the program was more politicized made
 
04:32:41.670 --> 04:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
more politicized than it was when nine
 
04:32:44.550 --> 04:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
Republican states decided uh to leave
 
04:32:44.560 --> 04:32:45.309 align:start position:0%
Republican states decided uh to leave
the

04:32:45.309 --> 04:32:45.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:32:47.510 --> 04:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
program and I was not a part of those
 
04:32:49.990 --> 04:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
discussions so I don't know the specific
 
04:32:52.030 --> 04:32:52.040 align:start position:0%
reasons that they used but I know that
 
04:32:54.469 --> 04:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
one of them was a
 
04:32:57.229 --> 04:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
frustration of uh the rules that are
 
04:33:02.030 --> 04:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
used by uh by Eric and the inability to
 
04:33:04.230 --> 04:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
change those to make them more
 
04:33:06.150 --> 04:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
compatible with what those States wanted
 
04:33:09.709 --> 04:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
to do and I'll get into uh some examples
 
04:33:11.750 --> 04:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
of that in a
 
04:33:11.760 --> 04:33:13.949 align:start position:0%
of that in a
second

04:33:13.949 --> 04:33:13.959 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:33:15.830 --> 04:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
um New
 
04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh the Secretary of State's
 
04:33:20.349 --> 04:33:20.359 align:start position:0%
office within the next couple of months
 
04:33:21.670 --> 04:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
is about ready
 
04:33:26.429 --> 04:33:26.439 align:start position:0%
to uh uh roll out the next generation of
 
04:33:28.789 --> 04:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
our Statewide voter registration
 
04:33:32.349 --> 04:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
database a brand new system and as part
 
04:33:34.189 --> 04:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
of that we are incorporating the
 
04:33:36.070 --> 04:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
national change of address
 
04:33:39.029 --> 04:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
information which is some of the stuff
 
04:33:42.629 --> 04:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
that Eric does uh it will be easier to
 
04:33:44.869 --> 04:33:44.879 align:start position:0%
share the death data that we collect uh
 
04:33:47.109 --> 04:33:47.119 align:start position:0%
through our division of Vital Records uh
 
04:33:48.189 --> 04:33:48.199 align:start position:0%
into that
 
04:33:51.910 --> 04:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
system and uh and I believe that it is
 
04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
going to make it a lot easier for our
 
04:33:57.070 --> 04:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist to maintain
 
04:34:01.390 --> 04:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
that database uh at at the local level
 
04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh in addition to that this committee
 
04:34:04.990 --> 04:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
has heard a couple of bills that deal
 
04:34:07.629 --> 04:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
with uh more frequent intervals in terms
 
04:34:10.150 --> 04:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
of a verification of the checklist
 
04:34:12.629 --> 04:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
formally called purging but that would
 
04:34:14.629 --> 04:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
be a more frequent review of inactive
 
04:34:17.709 --> 04:34:17.719 align:start position:0%
voters on that list to help keep those
 
04:34:19.551 --> 04:34:19.561 align:start position:0%
uh lists
 
04:34:22.949 --> 04:34:22.959 align:start position:0%
clean so with that understanding also
 
04:34:27.109 --> 04:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say that I've been uh
 
04:34:30.551 --> 04:34:30.561 align:start position:0%
involved in this election process since
 
04:34:33.551 --> 04:34:33.561 align:start position:0%
uh 2002 that's the same year that the
 
04:34:35.429 --> 04:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
help America vote Act passed Congress
 
04:34:37.869 --> 04:34:37.879 align:start position:0%
Congress and it was the first time that
 
04:34:40.789 --> 04:34:40.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was required to create and
 
04:34:43.830 --> 04:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
maintain a Statewide centralized voter
 
04:34:46.029 --> 04:34:46.039 align:start position:0%
database and I can tell you the
 
04:34:48.789 --> 04:34:48.799 align:start position:0%
discussion at the time was that we are
 
04:34:51.070 --> 04:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
going to have all of this personal and
 
04:34:55.750 --> 04:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
private voter information in one place
 
04:34:58.670 --> 04:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
and how important it is to keep that
 
04:35:01.910 --> 04:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
information private and confidential and
 
04:35:04.230 --> 04:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
the commitment at the time and I was a
 
04:35:05.709 --> 04:35:05.719 align:start position:0%
part of that was
 
04:35:08.949 --> 04:35:08.959 align:start position:0%
we're going to honor that uh you know
 
04:35:11.470 --> 04:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
that uh thing for the New Hampshire
 
04:35:13.949 --> 04:35:13.959 align:start position:0%
voters that we're not going to Simply
 
04:35:16.349 --> 04:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
give away all of this data that we now
 
04:35:21.070 --> 04:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:21.080 --> 04:35:22.629 align:start position:0%
 
level

04:35:22.629 --> 04:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:35:24.949 --> 04:35:24.959 align:start position:0%
so what Eric
 
04:35:28.470 --> 04:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
requires is a regular data dump of the
 
04:35:30.230 --> 04:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
information that we have not only in the
 
04:35:32.910 --> 04:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
elections database but also in the motor
 
04:35:36.429 --> 04:35:36.439 align:start position:0%
vehicles database and that dump includes
 
04:35:38.750 --> 04:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
private personal confidential
 
04:35:42.269 --> 04:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
information in the past when we have uh
 
04:35:44.390 --> 04:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
in the past when we did a a an
 
04:35:48.910 --> 04:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
interstate match uh we sent data to a
 
04:35:51.990 --> 04:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
central system and our data was matched
 
04:35:54.629 --> 04:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
up against the data from other states it
 
04:35:58.510 --> 04:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
was not kept uh it was simply a match
 
04:36:02.310 --> 04:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
and we received uh a lot of matches back
 
04:36:04.109 --> 04:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
of what appeared to be duplicate voters
 
04:36:06.910 --> 04:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
I think the number was close to a
 
04:36:09.230 --> 04:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
100,000 uh but it was very basic
 
04:36:11.349 --> 04:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
information New Hampshire was one of the
 
04:36:12.789 --> 04:36:12.799 align:start position:0%
few states that went through the
 
04:36:15.789 --> 04:36:15.799 align:start position:0%
exercise of going through all of that
 
04:36:18.390 --> 04:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
information uh eliminating names
 
04:36:21.590 --> 04:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
whenever we added middle names initials
 
04:36:23.949 --> 04:36:23.959 align:start position:0%
looked at birth dates stuff that was in
 
04:36:26.990 --> 04:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
our system and we narrowed it down to
 
04:36:27.000 --> 04:36:27.750 align:start position:0%
our system and we narrowed it down to
about

04:36:27.750 --> 04:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:36:31.949 --> 04:36:31.959 align:start position:0%
250 suspicious uh voters and out of that
 
04:36:34.429 --> 04:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
there were a handful was probably around
 
04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
10 uh where there were uh convictions
 
04:36:40.429 --> 04:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
based on prosecutions for inappropriate
 
04:36:43.709 --> 04:36:43.719 align:start position:0%
voting double voting uh that was found
 
04:36:46.470 --> 04:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
as a result of that check a really small
 
04:36:49.789 --> 04:36:49.799 align:start position:0%
number when you boil it right down but
 
04:36:54.629 --> 04:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
this is what the the the agreement says
 
04:36:58.390 --> 04:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh for members of uh of Eric this is
 
04:37:00.029 --> 04:37:00.039 align:start position:0%
what they have to agree
 
04:37:02.590 --> 04:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
to now within 60 days of the
 
04:37:05.670 --> 04:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
certification date and at least every 60
 
04:37:08.150 --> 04:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
days thereafter the member shall

United
 
04:38:15.629 --> 04:38:15.639 align:start position:0%
States so that's number one it's it is a
 
04:38:17.429 --> 04:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
complete dump of personal and private
 
04:38:21.269 --> 04:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
information to a third-party entity um
 
04:38:23.590 --> 04:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
that is not the state of New
 
04:38:26.629 --> 04:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now the next part that I have
 
04:38:28.910 --> 04:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
04:38:31.670 --> 04:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
with oh let me just refer you to the
 
04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
bill while we're on that topic real
 
04:38:33.920 --> 04:38:51.470 align:start position:0%
bill while we're on that topic real
quick

04:38:51.470 --> 04:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:55.990 --> 04:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
on lines uh starting on line 11 through
 
04:38:59.590 --> 04:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
13 a sentence says that the Secretary of
 
04:39:02.349 --> 04:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
State shall ensure that any information
 
04:39:05.349 --> 04:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
or data shared between agencies is
 
04:39:07.869 --> 04:39:07.879 align:start position:0%
protected by security processes and
 
04:39:10.230 --> 04:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
protocols and that any information or
 
04:39:13.429 --> 04:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
data that is of confidential nature
 
04:39:13.439 --> 04:39:14.709 align:start position:0%
data that is of confidential nature
remains

04:39:14.709 --> 04:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
remains
 
04:39:16.910 --> 04:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
confidential that's fine with me in
 
04:39:18.510 --> 04:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
terms of the Statewide voter
 
04:39:20.750 --> 04:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
registration database that's my
 
04:39:23.109 --> 04:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility I own that and if that
 
04:39:25.510 --> 04:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
system is hacked into or breached
 
04:39:28.349 --> 04:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
somehow that's on me but I have no
 
04:39:31.109 --> 04:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
authority over motor vehicle records uh
 
04:39:33.349 --> 04:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
housed by the divisional Motor
 
04:39:35.949 --> 04:39:35.959 align:start position:0%
Vehicles or any any other agency that
 
04:39:37.830 --> 04:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
might end up providing information under
 
04:39:37.840 --> 04:39:39.310 align:start position:0%
might end up providing information under
this

04:39:39.310 --> 04:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:39:41.910 --> 04:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
statute and I have no authority over
 
04:39:44.510 --> 04:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
what Eric would do uh with the data once
 
04:39:47.230 --> 04:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
they have it I can't guarantee even
 
04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
though they have they might have a good
 
04:39:52.110 --> 04:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
track record I cannot guarantee uh that
 
04:39:54.590 --> 04:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
that information is not going to be
 
04:39:58.430 --> 04:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
hacked or breached or or uh so I think
 
04:40:00.750 --> 04:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
that's an inappropriate Clause to have
 
04:40:03.750 --> 04:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
in this uh piece of
 
04:40:03.760 --> 04:40:07.230 align:start position:0%
in this uh piece of
legislation

04:40:07.230 --> 04:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:08.628 --> 04:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
then this goes on to say that the
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State shall consistent with
 
04:40:14.030 --> 04:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
membership requirements
 
04:40:18.030 --> 04:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
receive uh Eric reports for the purposes
 
04:40:19.788 --> 04:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
of improving the accuracy of voter
 
04:40:22.190 --> 04:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
registration data for which data
 
04:40:24.150 --> 04:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
provides evidence of eligible or
 
04:40:26.948 --> 04:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
potentially eligible citizens who are
 
04:40:29.470 --> 04:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
not registered to vote and initiate
 
04:40:32.430 --> 04:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
contact of each eligible or potentially
 
04:40:35.750 --> 04:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
eligible Citizen and supply information
 
04:40:38.830 --> 04:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
on how to register to
 
04:40:41.628 --> 04:40:41.638 align:start position:0%
vote that is the next issue that I have
 
04:40:42.948 --> 04:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
with this piece of
 
04:40:45.390 --> 04:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
legislation is that there should not be
 
04:40:49.230 --> 04:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
a third party dictating to New Hampshire
 
04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
how we are going to reach out and and
 
04:40:55.788 --> 04:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
encourage voters to register to vote
 
04:40:57.390 --> 04:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
that should be a decision that is made
 
04:40:59.708 --> 04:40:59.718 align:start position:0%
by the legislature and the citizens of
 
04:41:01.788 --> 04:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire and we should
 
04:41:04.788 --> 04:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
not put ourselves in a position where we
 
04:41:07.150 --> 04:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
a third party dictating how we are going
 
04:41:09.310 --> 04:41:09.320 align:start position:0%
to conduct that part of our election
 
04:41:13.110 --> 04:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
process so uh with that Mr chairman uh
 
04:41:14.990 --> 04:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions I
 
04:41:17.390 --> 04:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
just one uh there were there were nine
 
04:41:20.628 --> 04:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
states that left the Eric program uh I
 
04:41:21.948 --> 04:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
have not heard that any of them are
 
04:41:24.750 --> 04:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
considering coming back although uh that
 
04:41:24.760 --> 04:41:26.628 align:start position:0%
considering coming back although uh that
may

04:41:26.628 --> 04:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
may
 
04:41:31.390 --> 04:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
be enough um questions from the
 
04:41:33.708 --> 04:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative prudo
 
04:41:36.150 --> 04:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
O'Brien thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
04:41:38.990 --> 04:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh Mr secretary do you know why they
 
04:41:42.230 --> 04:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
left the can you just sum that up again
 
04:41:43.990 --> 04:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
for us thank you I can tell you what I
 
04:41:46.390 --> 04:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
heard again I was not a part of those uh
 
04:41:50.390 --> 04:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
conversations um uh one was the fact
 
04:41:53.070 --> 04:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
that there are Provisions in the Eric
 
04:41:54.390 --> 04:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
program like the one that I just
 
04:41:57.270 --> 04:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned about having to reach out to
 
04:41:59.350 --> 04:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
voters as a requirement of belonging to
 
04:42:03.868 --> 04:42:03.878 align:start position:0%
the program and uh concerns were
 
04:42:07.868 --> 04:42:07.878 align:start position:0%
expressed over for that and uh there was
 
04:42:10.550 --> 04:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
no desire to remove those concerns on
 
04:42:13.310 --> 04:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
the part of Eric um I understand that
 
04:42:15.150 --> 04:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
there were some issues with individuals
 
04:42:17.670 --> 04:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
that were participating uh on the board
 
04:42:21.708 --> 04:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
of directors uh but uh yeah that's all I
 
04:42:26.190 --> 04:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:28.750 --> 04:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
regard I have a followup along that same
 
04:42:32.430 --> 04:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
line um so I have to go last but is it
 
04:42:35.350 --> 04:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
concerning to you or your office that
 
04:42:37.550 --> 04:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
over a third of the members have left
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
this program in the last
 
04:42:43.270 --> 04:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
year I think it's an interesting fact
 
04:42:45.270 --> 04:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
although I I'm not looking at this
 
04:42:49.270 --> 04:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
program from that perspective uh I I I
 
04:42:51.150 --> 04:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
think that if there was a program out
 
04:42:53.430 --> 04:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
there that we where New Hampshire could
 
04:42:56.310 --> 04:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
match its data up with the data from
 
04:42:59.270 --> 04:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
other states uh and not have that data
 
04:43:01.990 --> 04:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
kept anywhere other than just providing
 
04:43:03.830 --> 04:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
that information I think that would make
 
04:43:05.510 --> 04:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
sense and I would certainly be happy to
 
04:43:08.830 --> 04:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
do it with our neighbors in New
 
04:43:11.708 --> 04:43:11.718 align:start position:0%
England uh representative
 
04:43:16.310 --> 04:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you Secretary of State um I
 
04:43:18.830 --> 04:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
think I heard you say that Eric tells
 
04:43:21.670 --> 04:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
you how the agreement tells you how to
 
04:43:26.070 --> 04:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
reach out and and I I guess I heard from
 
04:43:28.948 --> 04:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
the other speaker that that was not the
 
04:43:31.390 --> 04:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
case that it was up to you on how you
 
04:43:34.788 --> 04:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
wanted to do it and I thought in in a s
 
04:43:36.830 --> 04:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
in your own time frame but maybe I
 
04:43:38.788 --> 04:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
misunderstood could you clarify that
 
04:43:38.798 --> 04:43:42.990 align:start position:0%
misunderstood could you clarify that
please

04:43:42.990 --> 04:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:46.590 --> 04:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
sure so this is uh I'm reading right
 
04:43:48.270 --> 04:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
from the membership
 
04:43:50.590 --> 04:43:50.600 align:start position:0%
agreement when a when the member
 
04:43:53.590 --> 04:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
receives Eric data regarding eligible or
 
04:43:56.350 --> 04:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
possibly eligible citizens who are not
 
04:43:59.670 --> 04:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
registered to vote the member shall at a
 
04:44:02.788 --> 04:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
minimum initiate contact with each and
 
04:44:05.270 --> 04:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
every eligible or Poss ly eligible
 
04:44:08.150 --> 04:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
Citizen and inform them how to register
 
04:44:11.470 --> 04:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
to vote each member shall have until
 
04:44:14.948 --> 04:44:14.958 align:start position:0%
October 1st or 15 days before the close
 
04:44:18.270 --> 04:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
of registration whichever is earlier of
 
04:44:21.230 --> 04:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
the next federal general election year
 
04:44:23.788 --> 04:44:23.798 align:start position:0%
to initiate the contact with at least
 
04:44:23.798 --> 04:44:25.590 align:start position:0%
to initiate the contact with at least
90%

04:44:25.590 --> 04:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
90%
 
04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
95% of the eligible or potentially
 
04:44:31.670 --> 04:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
eligible citizens on whom data was
 
04:44:34.030 --> 04:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
provided and address validation was
 
04:44:36.948 --> 04:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
performed formed as described
 
04:44:39.948 --> 04:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
above and then it it continues on in a
 
04:44:43.150 --> 04:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
fairly lengthy uh paragraph from there
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
but to me that's a requirement that uh
 
04:44:49.150 --> 04:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
the state has to reach out to uh
 
04:44:51.990 --> 04:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
identified eligible or potentially
 
04:44:53.990 --> 04:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
eligible uh
 
04:45:01.110 --> 04:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
made questions from the
 
04:45:13.030 --> 04:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:17.350 --> 04:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
wey so I understand that um as Eric
 
04:45:21.230 --> 04:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
generates this data that
 
04:45:25.510 --> 04:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
um that actually Eric also has an a data
 
04:45:27.390 --> 04:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
sharing agreement with the center for
 
04:45:30.990 --> 04:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
election Innovation and research CER
 
04:45:33.830 --> 04:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
C and that that data set that data
 
04:45:36.628 --> 04:45:36.638 align:start position:0%
sharing agreement would theoretically
 
04:45:37.510 --> 04:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
allow them
 
04:45:37.520 --> 04:45:38.948 align:start position:0%
allow them
[Music]

04:45:38.948 --> 04:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:45:41.628 --> 04:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
to provide New Hampshire voter
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
information to Seer from
 
04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
Eric um there's
 
04:45:51.150 --> 04:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
no Clarity or prohibitions in the bylaws
 
04:45:53.990 --> 04:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
at least as I've read the Eric bylaws
 
04:45:59.550 --> 04:45:59.560 align:start position:0%
from February 23 about that and
 
04:46:03.590 --> 04:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
um there's also been some discussion
 
04:46:03.600 --> 04:46:06.590 align:start position:0%
um there's also been some discussion
about

04:46:06.590 --> 04:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:08.948 --> 04:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
some states uh
 
04:46:08.958 --> 04:46:10.830 align:start position:0%
some states uh
using

04:46:10.830 --> 04:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
using
 
04:46:14.110 --> 04:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
uh the c or C are using the information
 
04:46:16.868 --> 04:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
in some states to bolster registration
 
04:46:19.670 --> 04:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
on one side in particular I won't say
 
04:46:23.868 --> 04:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
which side um but do you have any
 
04:46:26.948 --> 04:46:26.958 align:start position:0%
concerns I if if this data
 
04:46:29.390 --> 04:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
sharing uh would occur with seir would
 
04:46:31.070 --> 04:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
you have any concerns about how that
 
04:46:34.510 --> 04:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
might affect um registration and and
 
04:46:36.070 --> 04:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
voting in New
 
04:46:38.470 --> 04:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well first I'm not aware of a
 
04:46:41.590 --> 04:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
sharing agreement um that's that's news
 
04:46:43.470 --> 04:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
to me and and I'm not saying it's not
 
04:46:45.270 --> 04:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
the case it could very well be but that
 
04:46:48.708 --> 04:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
just gets back to my initial comments
 
04:46:52.830 --> 04:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
about being serious uh with strong
 
04:46:55.590 --> 04:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
conviction that New Hampshire data the
 
04:46:57.868 --> 04:46:57.878 align:start position:0%
the information on New Hampshire voters
 
04:46:59.990 --> 04:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
should remain private and confidential
 
04:47:02.350 --> 04:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
just as we agreed to when we first
 
04:47:05.830 --> 04:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
created the database system
 
04:47:09.948 --> 04:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
um those states that Acquire data um you
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
know I would believe or certainly want
 
04:47:14.670 --> 04:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
to believe that that they would use that
 
04:47:16.830 --> 04:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
data uh in the best interests of the
 
04:47:20.110 --> 04:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
voters in their state and uh that's how
 
04:47:23.708 --> 04:47:23.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:31.510 --> 04:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:34.670 --> 04:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
Bay Secretary of State's office engage
 
04:47:37.350 --> 04:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
in any type of uh proactive Outreach to
 
04:47:41.270 --> 04:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:43.470 --> 04:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
voters if the question is do we send
 
04:47:46.030 --> 04:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
mailings out to individuals uh the
 
04:47:50.628 --> 04:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
answer is uh we don't uh but we do have
 
04:47:53.150 --> 04:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
very active programs through social
 
04:47:56.310 --> 04:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
media and conventional media to reaching
 
04:47:58.830 --> 04:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
out to let voters know about dates that
 
04:48:01.390 --> 04:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
are coming up uh in order to register to
 
04:48:04.070 --> 04:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
vote uh we initiated a really neat
 
04:48:06.548 --> 04:48:06.558 align:start position:0%
program this year where uh we have
 
04:48:10.350 --> 04:48:10.360 align:start position:0%
reached out to uh new American citizens
 
04:48:12.310 --> 04:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
those who have been recently
 
04:48:14.628 --> 04:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
naturalized uh we have a brochure for
 
04:48:16.750 --> 04:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
them uh that information comes in
 
04:48:20.070 --> 04:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
multiple languages uh we have a video uh
 
04:48:22.510 --> 04:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
that was produced with members of those
 
04:48:24.990 --> 04:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
minority communities uh and the
 
04:48:27.230 --> 04:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office encouraging
 
04:48:29.948 --> 04:48:29.958 align:start position:0%
people to vote that's up on our website
 
04:48:32.190 --> 04:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
uh and so we are actively reaching out
 
04:48:34.830 --> 04:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
to potentially new voters
 
04:48:37.070 --> 04:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
um we just did the great fourth grade
 
04:48:38.990 --> 04:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
sticker contest and I know it's going to
 
04:48:41.350 --> 04:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
be a few years before they can show up
 
04:48:44.070 --> 04:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
at the clerk's office but it gets them
 
04:48:46.270 --> 04:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
thinking about when I get old enough
 
04:48:47.708 --> 04:48:47.718 align:start position:0%
when I'm old enough I want to register
 
04:48:50.548 --> 04:48:50.558 align:start position:0%
to vote so you know we we do have
 
04:48:52.628 --> 04:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
programs in place where we are
 
04:48:55.670 --> 04:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
encouraging that uh opportunity may I
 
04:48:55.680 --> 04:48:56.670 align:start position:0%
encouraging that uh opportunity may I
follow

04:48:56.670 --> 04:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
follow
 
04:48:56.680 --> 04:48:58.430 align:start position:0%
follow
up

04:48:58.430 --> 04:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:49:01.590 --> 04:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
um should Eric be part of New
 
04:49:01.600 --> 04:49:02.910 align:start position:0%
um should Eric be part of New
Hampshire's

04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's
 
04:49:02.920 --> 04:49:05.230 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's
future

04:49:05.230 --> 04:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
future
 
04:49:08.390 --> 04:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
um would those
 
04:49:11.150 --> 04:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
um programs that you've mentioned you've
 
04:49:13.830 --> 04:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
been doing would would that not be
 
04:49:17.350 --> 04:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
responsive to the requirements of Eric
 
04:49:19.270 --> 04:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
do you feel that there are things
 
04:49:21.548 --> 04:49:21.558 align:start position:0%
specifically that you're not doing that
 
04:49:25.350 --> 04:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be done on account of Eric and
 
04:49:27.430 --> 04:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
again this is a legislative policy
 
04:49:30.190 --> 04:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
decision but what what Eric is calling
 
04:49:33.990 --> 04:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
for which we do not do is identify
 
04:49:37.030 --> 04:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
individuals who appear to meet the
 
04:49:39.628 --> 04:49:39.638 align:start position:0%
qualifications to be a voter but have
 
04:49:41.070 --> 04:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
not yet
 
04:49:44.590 --> 04:49:44.600 align:start position:0%
registered and and it would require my
 
04:49:47.110 --> 04:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
office to make a contact with those
 
04:49:49.030 --> 04:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
voters just letting them know that they
 
04:49:52.670 --> 04:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:55.350 --> 04:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
it representative prudo M Brien thank
 
04:49:58.390 --> 04:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman uh that makes
 
04:50:01.350 --> 04:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
me think of a few things what you just
 
04:50:05.190 --> 04:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
said so would data from the Department
 
04:50:08.190 --> 04:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles be shared and would
 
04:50:09.948 --> 04:50:09.958 align:start position:0%
that I'm trying to remember what I used
 
04:50:13.390 --> 04:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
when I when I uh register to to when I
 
04:50:16.548 --> 04:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
got my license would that include Social
 
04:50:19.070 --> 04:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
Security information my birth
 
04:50:22.510 --> 04:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
certificate passport information is that
 
04:50:24.110 --> 04:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
something that they would be gathering
 
04:50:27.430 --> 04:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
and then if I felt strongly about not
 
04:50:29.390 --> 04:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
voting for example maybe I had a
 
04:50:33.548 --> 04:50:33.558 align:start position:0%
religious um obstacle to that would that
 
04:50:34.948 --> 04:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
still be shared with them would that
 
04:50:37.750 --> 04:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
would that DMV information still be
 
04:50:40.788 --> 04:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
shared with this outof state
 
04:50:43.350 --> 04:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
organization so I'm I'm really glad you
 
04:50:44.708 --> 04:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
asked that
 
04:50:47.708 --> 04:50:47.718 align:start position:0%
question first I did not take a close
 
04:50:51.030 --> 04:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
look at what DMV information uh is being
 
04:50:53.350 --> 04:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
requested although it sounds like it's
 
04:50:55.910 --> 04:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
pretty comprehensive but New Hampshire
 
04:50:57.990 --> 04:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
is also unique in that we are one of
 
04:51:01.070 --> 04:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
just a handful of states that is exempt
 
04:51:03.110 --> 04:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
from the national voter registration Act
 
04:51:04.350 --> 04:51:04.360 align:start position:0%
of 199
 
04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
3 and at that time there was for those
 
04:51:11.788 --> 04:51:11.798 align:start position:0%
states that fell into that act uh there
 
04:51:15.350 --> 04:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
became a direct tie between elections
 
04:51:18.070 --> 04:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
and Motor Vehicles so that anybody going
 
04:51:20.628 --> 04:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
to get a driver's license could also uh
 
04:51:24.270 --> 04:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
register to vote and because of that
 
04:51:26.868 --> 04:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
most States 40 plus states in the
 
04:51:29.390 --> 04:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
country have their elections offices and
 
04:51:31.470 --> 04:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
their elections information
 
04:51:34.708 --> 04:51:34.718 align:start position:0%
already uh matched up and and and
 
04:51:37.948 --> 04:51:37.958 align:start position:0%
coinciding with their motor vehicle
 
04:51:40.310 --> 04:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
data that has not happened in New
 
04:51:43.150 --> 04:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because we have not had to do
 
04:51:46.190 --> 04:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
it there is a provision in Hava that
 
04:51:47.910 --> 04:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
allows and
 
04:51:50.948 --> 04:51:50.958 align:start position:0%
requires uh the elections data be
 
04:51:53.350 --> 04:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
matched up against the motor vehicle
 
04:51:57.190 --> 04:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
data so that we can identify same names
 
04:52:00.350 --> 04:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
same birth dates but maybe uh uh
 
04:52:02.310 --> 04:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
different addresses so that we can clean
 
04:52:05.270 --> 04:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
up the records and keep those clean but
 
04:52:09.310 --> 04:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
we do not have any access beyond that to
 
04:52:11.110 --> 04:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle records we do not keep
 
04:52:13.830 --> 04:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle records and motor vehicles
 
04:52:17.230 --> 04:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
does not keep any elections records so
 
04:52:19.750 --> 04:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire to participate in Eric
 
04:52:22.390 --> 04:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
there would also have to be an agreement
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
with uh the division of motor
 
04:52:27.990 --> 04:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh we would have to work out
 
04:52:28.000 --> 04:52:29.548 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh we would have to work out
our

04:52:29.548 --> 04:52:29.558 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:52:32.708 --> 04:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
um uh electronic systems to combine that
 
04:52:35.830 --> 04:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
data before it could be sent to Eric and
 
04:52:37.628 --> 04:52:37.638 align:start position:0%
I don't think that that's a big deal
 
04:52:40.350 --> 04:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
based on conversations I've had with the
 
04:52:42.070 --> 04:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
04:52:45.070 --> 04:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
Information Technology but uh it is a
 
04:52:48.868 --> 04:52:48.878 align:start position:0%
big deal in the sense that that the data
 
04:52:50.510 --> 04:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
that we have on citizens of New
 
04:52:53.470 --> 04:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are two distinctly separate
 
04:52:55.948 --> 04:52:55.958 align:start position:0%
silos and uh that would have to be
 
04:52:55.958 --> 04:52:58.948 align:start position:0%
silos and uh that would have to be
worked

04:52:58.948 --> 04:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:58.958 --> 04:53:01.590 align:start position:0%
 
out

04:53:01.590 --> 04:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:53:04.990 --> 04:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
lane thank you Secretary State
 
04:53:09.270 --> 04:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
um I I got a little confused about the
 
04:53:11.310 --> 04:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
information that we would be sharing
 
04:53:13.708 --> 04:53:13.718 align:start position:0%
with Eric and I think you said there was
 
04:53:15.948 --> 04:53:15.958 align:start position:0%
confidential information that would be
 
04:53:19.150 --> 04:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
shared and what is that confidential
 
04:53:21.948 --> 04:53:21.958 align:start position:0%
information that's not already
 
04:53:24.548 --> 04:53:24.558 align:start position:0%
public well number one it would be birth
 
04:53:24.558 --> 04:53:25.868 align:start position:0%
public well number one it would be birth
date

04:53:25.868 --> 04:53:25.878 align:start position:0%
date
 
04:53:25.878 --> 04:53:32.548 align:start position:0%
date
information

04:53:32.548 --> 04:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:32.558 --> 04:53:34.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:53:34.910 --> 04:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:37.470 --> 04:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
so it would be all name fields all
 
04:53:40.150 --> 04:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
address Fields driver's license or state
 
04:53:42.788 --> 04:53:42.798 align:start position:0%
ID number last four digits of social
 
04:53:45.310 --> 04:53:45.320 align:start position:0%

04:53:49.830 --> 04:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
dates current record status phone number
 
04:53:52.270 --> 04:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
uh email address or other electronic
 
04:53:54.990 --> 04:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
contact method uh there is a provision
 
04:53:56.990 --> 04:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
that says if that information is
 
04:54:00.628 --> 04:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
collected by the member State and we do
 
04:54:03.628 --> 04:54:03.638 align:start position:0%
not collect phone numbers or email add
 
04:54:06.070 --> 04:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
addresses for the purpose of entering it
 
04:54:13.470 --> 04:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:15.350 --> 04:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
database further questions from the
 
04:54:23.548 --> 04:54:23.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:26.390 --> 04:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
weary for pursuing that earlier Venture
 
04:54:28.190 --> 04:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
where you
 
04:54:30.510 --> 04:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
uh look through all those names and
 
04:54:32.510 --> 04:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
sorted out who were the duplicates and
 
04:54:34.190 --> 04:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
who were the problematics the 10
 
04:54:37.270 --> 04:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
problematic folks um there was a Yale
 
04:54:40.430 --> 04:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
study back in about 2021 that that
 
04:54:42.910 --> 04:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
estimated that Eric had a 4% false
 
04:54:46.470 --> 04:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
positive rate and so I'm
 
04:54:46.480 --> 04:54:48.030 align:start position:0%
positive rate and so I'm
curious

04:54:48.030 --> 04:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
curious
 
04:54:51.948 --> 04:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
um how how would the Secretary of
 
04:54:54.590 --> 04:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
State's office handle you know false
 
04:54:57.948 --> 04:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
positives and you know where someone is
 
04:55:00.590 --> 04:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
basically claiming to be or or Eric
 
04:55:03.628 --> 04:55:03.638 align:start position:0%
would identify those persons as that
 
04:55:07.788 --> 04:55:07.798 align:start position:0%
person as a duplicative voter but but in
 
04:55:09.670 --> 04:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
fact there was a reasonable explanation
 
04:55:12.590 --> 04:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
and that's how how would your office
 
04:55:12.600 --> 04:55:13.670 align:start position:0%
and that's how how would your office
handled

04:55:13.670 --> 04:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
handled
 
04:55:17.470 --> 04:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
that well it would it would require uh a
 
04:55:19.590 --> 04:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
very thorough review and when we went
 
04:55:23.390 --> 04:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
through the exercise the last time it is
 
04:55:25.670 --> 04:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
mind-boggling to know how many people
 
04:55:28.190 --> 04:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
have the same name and the same birth
 
04:55:30.990 --> 04:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
date uh in this country it is
 
04:55:34.430 --> 04:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
remarkable and so um
 
04:55:36.548 --> 04:55:36.558 align:start position:0%
you have to continue to look at ways to
 
04:55:39.628 --> 04:55:39.638 align:start position:0%
narrow uh the field by just adding more
 
04:55:42.030 --> 04:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
information that is available from
 
04:55:44.510 --> 04:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
whatever sources you could find and when
 
04:55:47.948 --> 04:55:47.958 align:start position:0%
we reached a certain point uh we had to
 
04:55:47.958 --> 04:55:48.910 align:start position:0%
we reached a certain point uh we had to
hand

04:55:48.910 --> 04:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
hand
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
over uh the potential matches to the
 
04:55:54.708 --> 04:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office who have a
 
04:55:54.718 --> 04:55:55.510 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office who have a
much

04:55:55.510 --> 04:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:55:58.910 --> 04:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
broader uh array of sources of
 
04:56:01.548 --> 04:56:01.558 align:start position:0%
information uh because of their law
 
04:56:04.150 --> 04:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement ability they have databases
 
04:56:06.670 --> 04:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
that uh Secretary of State's office
 
04:56:10.548 --> 04:56:10.558 align:start position:0%
simply does not have access to and then
 
04:56:13.948 --> 04:56:13.958 align:start position:0%
uh if they they end up being convinced
 
04:56:16.910 --> 04:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
that you know they have found uh matches
 
04:56:19.708 --> 04:56:19.718 align:start position:0%
for duplicate voting then then they do
 
04:56:22.788 --> 04:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
an investigation and so I mean it is a
 
04:56:25.708 --> 04:56:25.718 align:start position:0%
very thorough uh wellth thought out
 
04:56:29.310 --> 04:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
process a 4% false positive uh wouldn't
 
04:56:32.270 --> 04:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
concern me at
 
04:56:32.280 --> 04:56:35.470 align:start position:0%
concern me at
all

04:56:35.470 --> 04:56:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:40.990 --> 04:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
Rapter Mr chair um Mr secretary um going
 
04:56:43.190 --> 04:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
back to the requirement to reach out to
 
04:56:45.670 --> 04:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
potential voters which you identified as
 
04:56:48.390 --> 04:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
a burden if you don't follow that
 
04:56:50.270 --> 04:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
requirement to the letter would you get
 
04:56:51.910 --> 04:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
kicked out of Eric or is there some
 
04:56:53.868 --> 04:56:53.878 align:start position:0%
other penalty or
 
04:56:56.150 --> 04:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
sanction first of all don't get me wrong
 
04:56:58.350 --> 04:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
I didn't say that was a burden what what
 
04:57:02.030 --> 04:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
I was objecting to was a a
 
04:57:04.788 --> 04:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
third-party uh instructing New Hampshire
 
04:57:06.390 --> 04:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
that they had to do it if the
 
04:57:07.708 --> 04:57:07.718 align:start position:0%
legislature said this is what you're
 
04:57:11.350 --> 04:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
going to do uh we would make it happen
 
04:57:15.868 --> 04:57:15.878 align:start position:0%
um uh get getting back to uh Eric there
 
04:57:17.670 --> 04:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
are Provisions in here of what happens
 
04:57:20.110 --> 04:57:20.120 align:start position:0%
if you don't follow through with uh the
 
04:57:22.070 --> 04:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
information and I'll admit I didn't read
 
04:57:24.270 --> 04:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
those as closely as I read the parts
 
04:57:26.430 --> 04:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
that I just conveyed to you to you
 
04:57:30.030 --> 04:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:31.990 --> 04:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
hearing he we're going
 
04:57:34.430 --> 04:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
to I know I'm I'm asking the committee
 
04:57:36.868 --> 04:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
to to get to the end of this um but I'm
 
04:57:38.190 --> 04:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
not going I understand the importance of
 
04:57:39.150 --> 04:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
this so I'm not going to cut off
 
04:57:42.590 --> 04:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
questions but let's uh let's be direct
 
04:57:42.600 --> 04:57:46.830 align:start position:0%
questions but let's uh let's be direct
representative

04:57:46.830 --> 04:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:50.470 --> 04:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
Bay do you have an estimate of how many
 
04:57:52.708 --> 04:57:52.718 align:start position:0%
eligible but unregistered voters there
 
04:57:54.390 --> 04:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
are in New
 
04:57:57.910 --> 04:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no I don't uh but I can tell
 
04:58:00.190 --> 04:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
you that among all the states New
 
04:58:02.548 --> 04:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a very very very high
 
04:58:06.030 --> 04:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
participation rate of uh citizens that
 
04:58:09.590 --> 04:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
participate to vote here and so it it
 
04:58:11.628 --> 04:58:11.638 align:start position:0%
the number of Voters that we have in
 
04:58:13.510 --> 04:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
that category I would guess is much
 
04:58:15.670 --> 04:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
smaller than it would be in some of the
 
04:58:15.680 --> 04:58:19.110 align:start position:0%
smaller than it would be in some of the
other

04:58:19.110 --> 04:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:21.350 --> 04:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
states other questions to so you know
 
04:58:22.548 --> 04:58:22.558 align:start position:0%
the number you're looking for is called
 
04:58:25.350 --> 04:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
the VAP ler age participation and the
 
04:58:26.788 --> 04:58:26.798 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office produces a
 
04:58:28.390 --> 04:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
report about it every two years it's
 
04:58:29.868 --> 04:58:29.878 align:start position:0%
available directly on their website I'll
 
04:58:32.470 --> 04:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
do the plug for you um with that I don't
 
04:58:33.990 --> 04:58:34.000 align:start position:0%

04:59:55.470 --> 04:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
if I recall correctly tabled the purpose
 
04:59:59.230 --> 04:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
of it is to eliminate the affidavit
 
05:00:02.548 --> 05:00:02.558 align:start position:0%
ballot procedure and basically say if
 
05:00:05.150 --> 05:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
you want to vote you provide the
 
05:00:07.390 --> 05:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
documentation you can do that you can
 
05:00:09.270 --> 05:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
register to vote on the day of the
 
05:00:11.150 --> 05:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
election but you provide the
 
05:00:13.070 --> 05:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
documentation if you don't provide the
 
05:00:15.670 --> 05:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
documentation you don't vote period end
 
05:00:18.910 --> 05:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:21.030 --> 05:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's the sort of testimony that
 
05:00:23.430 --> 05:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
I love okay uh with that we'll take
 
05:00:25.990 --> 05:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee on 1569
 
05:00:27.750 --> 05:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
from the sponsor and he is he is correct
 
05:00:29.270 --> 05:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
it is identical to the bill that was
 
05:00:32.070 --> 05:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
tabled in what I refer to as table thaon
 
05:00:35.750 --> 05:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
um uh from last year so representative
 
05:00:37.548 --> 05:00:37.558 align:start position:0%
Brennan I believe you want to speak or
 
05:00:40.750 --> 05:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
no oh representative
 
05:00:43.070 --> 05:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
weary Aon thank you for taking my
 
05:00:45.948 --> 05:00:45.958 align:start position:0%
question I believe that there was a a
 
05:00:49.868 --> 05:00:49.878 align:start position:0%
study that uh representative pruss did I
 
05:00:52.830 --> 05:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
I believe for with regard
 
05:00:55.948 --> 05:00:55.958 align:start position:0%
to folks who had submitted affidavits
 
05:00:58.548 --> 05:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
but had not provided enough
 
05:01:01.910 --> 05:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
information and in in follow-ups the
 
05:01:04.910 --> 05:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of people who actually ended
 
05:01:04.920 --> 05:01:05.830 align:start position:0%
percentage of people who actually ended
up

05:01:05.830 --> 05:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:01:08.750 --> 05:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
completing their affidavits was
 
05:01:10.990 --> 05:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
surprisingly low like less than
 
05:01:13.030 --> 05:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
10% um is
 
05:01:15.750 --> 05:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
that what this bill is trying to get at
 
05:01:19.070 --> 05:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
is is you know removing these sort of
 
05:01:22.788 --> 05:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
excuses for not completing the you know
 
05:01:26.708 --> 05:01:26.718 align:start position:0%
affidavits of Eligibility to vote well
 
05:01:30.310 --> 05:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
you know I mean I suppose that is one of
 
05:01:32.590 --> 05:01:32.600 align:start position:0%
the one of the benefits maybe I you know
 
05:01:33.548 --> 05:01:33.558 align:start position:0%
I I
 
05:01:34.910 --> 05:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
to be very honest with you until you
 
05:01:38.270 --> 05:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
just uh notified me of that study I I
 
05:01:42.070 --> 05:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
was not aware of of that study um but I
 
05:01:45.350 --> 05:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
guess what I would say is it you know
 
05:01:47.310 --> 05:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I remember when
 
05:01:50.868 --> 05:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
the when the affidavit ballot bill was
 
05:01:54.830 --> 05:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
um was uh was going through the process
 
05:01:57.110 --> 05:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
was well there was a there was a
 
05:01:58.708 --> 05:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
question about well would this be
 
05:02:01.310 --> 05:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because it'll be you're
 
05:02:03.990 --> 05:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
not counting arguably are not counting
 
05:02:06.708 --> 05:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
all the votes on the night of the of the
 
05:02:09.590 --> 05:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh election although as I think I said
 
05:02:11.030 --> 05:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
at the time with regard to that it's
 
05:02:13.190 --> 05:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
hard it's hard to understand how it
 
05:02:15.628 --> 05:02:15.638 align:start position:0%
could be unconstitutional when recounts
 
05:02:19.110 --> 05:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
are allowed so you you allow recounts so
 
05:02:23.110 --> 05:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
um but but anyway it does it it
 
05:02:26.150 --> 05:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
does it eliminates that issue in other
 
05:02:27.910 --> 05:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
words to the extent that there's some
 
05:02:29.990 --> 05:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
claim some suggestion that you're not g
 
05:02:33.070 --> 05:02:33.080 align:start position:0%
to have all the everybody's vote who
 
05:02:34.510 --> 05:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
everybody who voted is not going to get
 
05:02:37.590 --> 05:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
counted that day this eliminates that
 
05:02:39.868 --> 05:02:39.878 align:start position:0%
because you you either provide the
 
05:02:43.750 --> 05:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
documentation or you don't vote um and
 
05:02:45.868 --> 05:02:45.878 align:start position:0%
the the other thing is candidly I just
 
05:02:50.830 --> 05:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
have it seems to me that it is not a
 
05:02:50.840 --> 05:02:51.948 align:start position:0%
have it seems to me that it is not a
good

05:02:51.948 --> 05:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
system that allows
 
05:02:57.230 --> 05:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
someone where where you're supposed to
 
05:02:59.670 --> 05:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
have all this do you know all the stuff
 
05:03:02.350 --> 05:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
the documentation in the four areas that
 
05:03:05.150 --> 05:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
you are able to say in effect well I
 
05:03:08.750 --> 05:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
don't have that but I swear that uh that
 
05:03:12.350 --> 05:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
it's all true and we just sort of you
 
05:03:16.990 --> 05:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
know have to accept that um so this is
 
05:03:20.910 --> 05:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:24.750 --> 05:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
that from the committee representative
 
05:03:28.910 --> 05:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
Lane um representative Lyn uh
 
05:03:31.548 --> 05:03:31.558 align:start position:0%
as you have a whole section about
 
05:03:33.430 --> 05:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
citizenship and having to prove
 
05:03:36.628 --> 05:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
citizenship in the bill um are you aware
 
05:03:39.868 --> 05:03:39.878 align:start position:0%
that there are federal cases where they
 
05:03:42.390 --> 05:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
have said that basically you cannot do
 
05:03:44.590 --> 05:03:44.600 align:start position:0%
that that you have to when there's a
 
05:03:48.110 --> 05:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
federal election you have to accept yes
 
05:03:53.310 --> 05:03:53.320 align:start position:0%
or no um are you a citizen yes or no and
 
05:03:55.230 --> 05:03:55.240 align:start position:0%
I guess I would follow up if you wanted
 
05:03:57.830 --> 05:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
to have a conversation about those cases
 
05:03:59.948 --> 05:03:59.958 align:start position:0%
yeah you know my understanding I think
 
05:04:01.470 --> 05:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
the case that you're referring I can't
 
05:04:02.628 --> 05:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
remember the name but I know it was
 
05:04:06.150 --> 05:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
written by Justice Scalia I think that
 
05:04:08.190 --> 05:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
it that
 
05:04:11.788 --> 05:04:11.798 align:start position:0%
applied under you know that it applied
 
05:04:13.788 --> 05:04:13.798 align:start position:0%
under the statutes that are not that New
 
05:04:16.628 --> 05:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not covered by I think
 
05:04:20.670 --> 05:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct um and the the
 
05:04:22.708 --> 05:04:22.718 align:start position:0%
other part of that is I mean it's it's
 
05:04:24.470 --> 05:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
this is sort of Orphan Overlook but as I
 
05:04:29.628 --> 05:04:29.638 align:start position:0%
recall that decision I think that the
 
05:04:35.628 --> 05:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
the court left it open that there is
 
05:04:39.670 --> 05:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
that the the the form that is used in
 
05:04:41.750 --> 05:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
the states that are covered by the the
 
05:04:41.760 --> 05:04:42.910 align:start position:0%
the states that are covered by the the
national

05:04:42.910 --> 05:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
national
 
05:04:46.788 --> 05:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
legislation um there is a way that those
 
05:04:50.230 --> 05:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
states can challenge having to use the
 
05:04:52.990 --> 05:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
form they just basically that decision
 
05:04:54.868 --> 05:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
was kind of a procedural decision you
 
05:05:01.470 --> 05:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:01.480 --> 05:05:05.708 align:start position:0%
 
procedure

05:05:05.708 --> 05:05:05.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:08.430 --> 05:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
also are you aware of how expensive and
 
05:05:11.270 --> 05:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
how few people really have that
 
05:05:11.280 --> 05:05:13.670 align:start position:0%
how few people really have that
documentation

05:05:13.670 --> 05:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
05:05:17.788 --> 05:05:17.798 align:start position:0%
available well no I guess I'm no I'm not
 
05:05:20.430 --> 05:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of that I think that I I I
 
05:05:24.110 --> 05:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
think that um most people do have their
 
05:05:26.150 --> 05:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
birth certificates or can relatively
 
05:05:30.150 --> 05:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
easily get them and you know that what
 
05:05:32.910 --> 05:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
it what this sort of really brings home
 
05:05:36.230 --> 05:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
to me is that I I think that voting is a
 
05:05:38.070 --> 05:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
sacred right I completely agree to that
 
05:05:40.510 --> 05:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
but it's but it's also an important
 
05:05:42.990 --> 05:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
right and it's not so I don't think it's
 
05:05:45.230 --> 05:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to say to somebody you know
 
05:05:47.510 --> 05:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
if you want to vote you shouldn't if I
 
05:05:49.470 --> 05:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
want to vote in 10 minutes I shouldn't
 
05:05:51.110 --> 05:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
have started thinking about it 10
 
05:05:52.948 --> 05:05:52.958 align:start position:0%
minutes ago I should have started
 
05:05:56.190 --> 05:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
thinking about it you know uh a while
 
05:05:58.830 --> 05:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
ago so that I could make sure I I can do
 
05:06:00.708 --> 05:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
what I need to do to be able to vote I
 
05:06:04.788 --> 05:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:06.788 --> 05:06:06.798 align:start position:0%
reasonable further questions from the
 
05:06:11.270 --> 05:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:15.750 --> 05:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
Hammer um I have a situation here and
 
05:06:18.150 --> 05:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
I'll end it with a question what about
 
05:06:21.110 --> 05:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
the family who has lived in Manchester's
 
05:06:24.830 --> 05:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
W 10 and always voted every election
 
05:06:27.110 --> 05:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
well their family home had a fire
 
05:06:30.070 --> 05:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
recently just before the January 23rd
 
05:06:32.670 --> 05:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
presidential primary the home was
 
05:06:36.230 --> 05:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
declared a total loss I'll repeat a
 
05:06:40.070 --> 05:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
total loss the family escaped with only
 
05:06:43.150 --> 05:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
the clothes on their backs this family
 
05:06:45.430 --> 05:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
was able to rent an apartment in
 
05:06:48.510 --> 05:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester's W 12 this family went to
 
05:06:51.270 --> 05:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
vote at their new polling location and
 
05:06:54.470 --> 05:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
tried to register without any IDs
 
05:06:57.390 --> 05:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
because we have voter identification
 
05:07:01.350 --> 05:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
affidavit in place currently this family
 
05:07:04.708 --> 05:07:04.718 align:start position:0%
was able to register in W 12 and vote if
 
05:07:07.030 --> 05:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
you take these voter identification
 
05:07:09.628 --> 05:07:09.638 align:start position:0%
exceptions away wouldn't that be yet
 
05:07:12.070 --> 05:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
another Devastation to this family who
 
05:07:14.310 --> 05:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
has already suffered a total loss of
 
05:07:17.070 --> 05:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
their family home well I first of all I
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
think you posit a really really you know
 
05:07:24.150 --> 05:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
unusual situation but I suppose if if
 
05:07:27.430 --> 05:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
the if the people were really you know
 
05:07:30.868 --> 05:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
if that terrible situation happened and
 
05:07:33.350 --> 05:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
the person was and the person the people
 
05:07:35.150 --> 05:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
were really interested in voting for
 
05:07:36.788 --> 05:07:36.798 align:start position:0%
example I would think that one of the
 
05:07:38.830 --> 05:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
things they might have been able to do
 
05:07:42.510 --> 05:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
is have family members or neighbors who
 
05:07:44.948 --> 05:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
didn't live with them be able to come in
 
05:07:47.830 --> 05:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
and say and and say look this is what
 
05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
happened this the the house just burned
 
05:07:51.390 --> 05:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
down yesterday I've known these people
 
05:07:53.708 --> 05:07:53.718 align:start position:0%
for 40 years of course they're citizens
 
05:07:56.270 --> 05:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
of the United States I know that um and
 
05:07:58.190 --> 05:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
I would think that a reasonable election
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
official would accept that under those
 
05:08:01.200 --> 05:08:03.910 align:start position:0%
official would accept that under those
circumstances

05:08:03.910 --> 05:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
05:08:05.510 --> 05:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
yes that's
 
05:08:08.590 --> 05:08:08.600 align:start position:0%
fine so that's an
 
05:08:11.430 --> 05:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
exception right well no no no the rules
 
05:08:14.830 --> 05:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
it says in there or or any natural a or
 
05:08:17.190 --> 05:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
any other reasonable documentation which
 
05:08:19.070 --> 05:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
indicates the applicant as a citizen of
 
05:08:21.708 --> 05:08:21.718 align:start position:0%
the United States um so if you know if
 
05:08:25.070 --> 05:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
you're if if documentation is too narrow
 
05:08:26.788 --> 05:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
maybe it should say evidence or any
 
05:08:29.910 --> 05:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
other reasonable evidence uh sure that
 
05:08:31.628 --> 05:08:31.638 align:start position:0%
if that you know that might be an
 
05:08:34.670 --> 05:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate change to make but I think
 
05:08:36.868 --> 05:08:36.878 align:start position:0%
you know I think that the example I gave
 
05:08:38.628 --> 05:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
would be a reasonable in those
 
05:08:40.628 --> 05:08:40.638 align:start position:0%
circumstances now it might not be in
 
05:08:42.310 --> 05:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
other circumstances but if something
 
05:08:44.628 --> 05:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
happened you know on the ver on the you
 
05:08:46.788 --> 05:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
know Eve of the election sure I think
 
05:08:49.070 --> 05:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
that would make
 
05:08:52.150 --> 05:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
sense questions from the
 
05:08:54.390 --> 05:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none oh I'm sorry I
 
05:08:55.670 --> 05:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
apologize representative Bron I didn't
 
05:08:58.990 --> 05:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
see your hand thank you it's good to see
 
05:09:02.270 --> 05:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
you again representative Lynn um earlier
 
05:09:04.830 --> 05:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
day on a different bill you testified
 
05:09:08.628 --> 05:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
that you support um every eligible voter
 
05:09:10.708 --> 05:09:10.718 align:start position:0%
being able to cast their ballot and have
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
their ballot counted are you concerned
 
05:09:16.310 --> 05:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
at all that if this legislation is
 
05:09:19.910 --> 05:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
enacted that every eligible voter would
 
05:09:22.510 --> 05:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
not be able to cast their ballot and
 
05:09:25.230 --> 05:09:25.240 align:start position:0%
have that vote counted no I'm not
 
05:09:27.390 --> 05:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
because as I said be as I said before it
 
05:09:31.670 --> 05:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that it is not in in any
 
05:09:31.680 --> 05:09:32.628 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that it is not in in any
way

05:09:32.628 --> 05:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:09:35.788 --> 05:09:35.798 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to say that if you want to
 
05:09:38.788 --> 05:09:38.798 align:start position:0%
vote you have to act responsibly you
 
05:09:41.070 --> 05:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
can't just decide you know you can't
 
05:09:43.190 --> 05:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's not like you know at
 
05:09:45.750 --> 05:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
five minutes to 12 I decide what let's
 
05:09:47.150 --> 05:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
see what do I want for lunch today am I
 
05:09:48.628 --> 05:09:48.638 align:start position:0%
going to have tuna Fisher turkey
 
05:09:50.948 --> 05:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
sandwich or whatever you you it's it's
 
05:09:53.230 --> 05:09:53.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable to say you have to think if
 
05:09:55.590 --> 05:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
you want to vote you have to think about
 
05:09:57.910 --> 05:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
that at least some reasonable period of
 
05:10:01.150 --> 05:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
time in advance followup please yep
 
05:10:01.160 --> 05:10:02.548 align:start position:0%
time in advance followup please yep
follow

05:10:02.548 --> 05:10:02.558 align:start position:0%
follow
 
05:10:04.350 --> 05:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
are you aware that many voters make
 
05:10:06.270 --> 05:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
their decision about how they're going
 
05:10:08.548 --> 05:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
to cast their ballot as they're walking
 
05:10:11.190 --> 05:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
into the polling location and would it
 
05:10:15.070 --> 05:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
not be um in the same vein as
 
05:10:17.430 --> 05:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
prohibiting those folks you know you're
 
05:10:19.350 --> 05:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
the line of your argument is that people
 
05:10:21.788 --> 05:10:21.798 align:start position:0%
should be thinking far in advance and
 
05:10:23.830 --> 05:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
many people don't and they make that
 
05:10:26.990 --> 05:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
decision the day of the moment of as
 
05:10:28.510 --> 05:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
they're walking into the polling
 
05:10:30.590 --> 05:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
location and as they close the curtain
 
05:10:32.310 --> 05:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
behind them in the polling booth think
 
05:10:34.548 --> 05:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
that you're confusing two things the
 
05:10:38.070 --> 05:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
question of I'm going to vote is a
 
05:10:39.990 --> 05:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
different question than who I'm going to
 
05:10:43.070 --> 05:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
vote for I I have frankly been in that
 
05:10:46.628 --> 05:10:46.638 align:start position:0%
situation very many times of well you
 
05:10:48.628 --> 05:10:48.638 align:start position:0%
know closing the closing the curtain
 
05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
particularly for positions further down
 
05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
the down the ballot absolutely that's a
 
05:10:56.948 --> 05:10:56.958 align:start position:0%
different question than am I going to
 
05:11:00.788 --> 05:11:00.798 align:start position:0%
vote I you know I I I know and I think
 
05:11:04.708 --> 05:11:04.718 align:start position:0%
you know most reasonable people know
 
05:11:06.350 --> 05:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
fairly significantly in advance whether
 
05:11:08.350 --> 05:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to vote or not that's a
 
05:11:09.830 --> 05:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
different question I think thank you
 
05:11:11.868 --> 05:11:11.878 align:start position:0%
followup please uh this will be the last
 
05:11:14.788 --> 05:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
one but yes thank you are you aware of
 
05:11:17.470 --> 05:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
any numbers from perhaps the Attorney
 
05:11:20.750 --> 05:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
General's office that have uh that would
 
05:11:22.230 --> 05:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
indicate that we have an issue with
 
05:11:25.270 --> 05:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
affidavits being filed for voting
 
05:11:28.230 --> 05:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
purposes that have led to prosecution
 
05:11:31.230 --> 05:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
for voter fraud um which seems to be the
 
05:11:32.868 --> 05:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
basis of this is that we're trying to
 
05:11:34.868 --> 05:11:34.878 align:start position:0%
eliminate voter fraud and we want to
 
05:11:36.670 --> 05:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
provide as much information as possible
 
05:11:39.070 --> 05:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
when registering to vote are you aware
 
05:11:41.590 --> 05:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
of what the numbers are from the
 
05:11:43.868 --> 05:11:43.878 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office regarding the
 
05:11:46.948 --> 05:11:46.958 align:start position:0%
amount of prosecutions for voter fraud
 
05:11:49.548 --> 05:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
as a result of using an affidavit to
 
05:11:51.390 --> 05:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
vote well I guess I'd have two responses
 
05:11:53.708 --> 05:11:53.718 align:start position:0%
first uh the the the information that
 
05:11:55.548 --> 05:11:55.558 align:start position:0%
was brought out by by your colleague
 
05:11:58.150 --> 05:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
sitting next to you about the number of
 
05:12:00.270 --> 05:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
affidavits that are the the information
 
05:12:03.310 --> 05:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
is not provided after words um that see
 
05:12:05.990 --> 05:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
it seem would seem to me that uh you
 
05:12:08.868 --> 05:12:08.878 align:start position:0%
know that would raise my suspicion about
 
05:12:11.390 --> 05:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
why wasn't it provided uh suggesting
 
05:12:14.110 --> 05:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
that maybe they didn't it didn't exist
 
05:12:16.030 --> 05:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
um so that that's that's the first part
 
05:12:18.030 --> 05:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
the second part part that is is I think
 
05:12:20.670 --> 05:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
is critically important there's no
 
05:12:24.110 --> 05:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
question that voter fraud is very hard
 
05:12:29.590 --> 05:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
to prove so you know um is the uh I I
 
05:12:30.948 --> 05:12:30.958 align:start position:0%
don't have the statistics from the
 
05:12:32.470 --> 05:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office I suspect it's
 
05:12:33.910 --> 05:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
pretty low it's I I mean I've heard
 
05:12:36.548 --> 05:12:36.558 align:start position:0%
about you know a few times every every
 
05:12:38.430 --> 05:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
election cycle you hear of a few cases
 
05:12:40.628 --> 05:12:40.638 align:start position:0%
like that sure does that is does that
 
05:12:43.948 --> 05:12:43.958 align:start position:0%
mean that that's all the fraud there is
 
05:12:47.310 --> 05:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
no as as as pointed out by the other you
 
05:12:49.230 --> 05:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
know the other why didn't these people
 
05:12:51.548 --> 05:12:51.558 align:start position:0%
return their affidavits I mean one the
 
05:12:53.470 --> 05:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
or documentation That was supposed to be
 
05:12:56.310 --> 05:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
provided it seems to me that as I said
 
05:12:58.788 --> 05:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
voter voter fraud I think is very
 
05:13:01.350 --> 05:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
difficult to prove and so I think the
 
05:13:03.030 --> 05:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
answer is we really don't know the
 
05:13:05.150 --> 05:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
extent of voter
 
05:13:07.230 --> 05:13:07.240 align:start position:0%
fraud right further questions from the
 
05:13:09.708 --> 05:13:09.718 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
05:13:12.708 --> 05:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
Burnham Mr chairman thank you for taking
 
05:13:12.718 --> 05:13:14.390 align:start position:0%
Burnham Mr chairman thank you for taking
my

05:13:14.390 --> 05:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:13:16.708 --> 05:13:16.718 align:start position:0%
question I recently went with my
 
05:13:18.708 --> 05:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
18-year-old daughter to get a second set
 
05:13:18.718 --> 05:13:19.788 align:start position:0%
18-year-old daughter to get a second set
of

05:13:19.788 --> 05:13:19.798 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:13:23.310 --> 05:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
earrings and knowing what I know about
 
05:13:26.990 --> 05:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
what's acceptable to uh register to vote
 
05:13:30.590 --> 05:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
in our state I was a bit taken back that
 
05:13:34.788 --> 05:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
she required her ID to show her age and
 
05:13:37.708 --> 05:13:37.718 align:start position:0%
where she lived unfortunately she wasn't
 
05:13:40.230 --> 05:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
aware and uh therefore she wouldn't be
 
05:13:42.510 --> 05:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
able to get her ears
 
05:13:45.628 --> 05:13:45.638 align:start position:0%
pierced I say this
 
05:13:48.708 --> 05:13:48.718 align:start position:0%
because if you are if one is required to
 
05:13:50.788 --> 05:13:50.798 align:start position:0%
have some type of identification to get
 
05:13:53.230 --> 05:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
their ears pierced wouldn't one think
 
05:13:55.470 --> 05:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
that they would need that identification
 
05:13:59.310 --> 05:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to go and vote no I I mean
 
05:14:02.310 --> 05:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
exactly it just seems to me it's
 
05:14:03.910 --> 05:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know it's hard to imagine that
 
05:14:06.190 --> 05:14:06.200 align:start position:0%
somebody doesn't understand that this is
 
05:14:10.030 --> 05:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
voting is a is a serious matter and that
 
05:14:11.390 --> 05:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
you you know you're not going to just be
 
05:14:13.270 --> 05:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
able to I would think that most people
 
05:14:14.910 --> 05:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
would understand I'm not going to just
 
05:14:18.590 --> 05:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
be able to walk in and you know uh and
 
05:14:21.310 --> 05:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
and just and just vote without having to
 
05:14:25.510 --> 05:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
provide any any any uh documentation or
 
05:14:27.390 --> 05:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
evidence of who I am and and that I meet
 
05:14:27.400 --> 05:14:30.190 align:start position:0%
evidence of who I am and and that I meet
the

05:14:30.190 --> 05:14:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:32.670 --> 05:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
requirements from the committee
 
05:14:32.680 --> 05:14:36.110 align:start position:0%
requirements from the committee
see

05:14:36.110 --> 05:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:38.390 --> 05:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
none this is I I already said the last
 
05:14:39.670 --> 05:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
one was the last one so this is actually
 
05:14:41.310 --> 05:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
the last one I would hope the ranking
 
05:14:42.628 --> 05:14:42.638 align:start position:0%
member will back me up on that after
 
05:14:42.638 --> 05:14:43.270 align:start position:0%
member will back me up on that after
this

05:14:43.270 --> 05:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:14:45.350 --> 05:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
one thank
 
05:14:49.868 --> 05:14:49.878 align:start position:0%
you um New Hampshire is in a a critical
 
05:14:52.750 --> 05:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
time period where we are experiencing a
 
05:14:56.708 --> 05:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
housing crisis like never before um if
 
05:14:59.590 --> 05:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
someone is without a home
 
05:15:03.070 --> 05:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
homeless um transient
 
05:15:05.590 --> 05:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
do they forfeit their right to vote
 
05:15:07.910 --> 05:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
because they don't have a permanent
 
05:15:10.350 --> 05:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
address no I don't think they do I think
 
05:15:12.070 --> 05:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
they have I think that they there are
 
05:15:15.830 --> 05:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
ways that they uh that they can you know
 
05:15:18.708 --> 05:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
that they can confirm that they have a
 
05:15:22.110 --> 05:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
domicile um in wherever wherever that
 
05:15:25.868 --> 05:15:25.878 align:start position:0%
may be um and and you know and I think
 
05:15:27.948 --> 05:15:27.958 align:start position:0%
we've I think we've heard at least I've
 
05:15:30.868 --> 05:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
heard examples of like you know police
 
05:15:33.150 --> 05:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
officers or Social Service workers or
 
05:15:35.708 --> 05:15:35.718 align:start position:0%
whatever sort of being able to verify
 
05:15:38.190 --> 05:15:38.200 align:start position:0%
yes you know this person actually does
 
05:15:41.590 --> 05:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
live at this at you know in this
 
05:15:44.310 --> 05:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
encampment or whatever so I think it can
 
05:15:46.110 --> 05:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
it can be done again does it require
 
05:15:48.590 --> 05:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
somebody to think a little bit about it
 
05:15:51.150 --> 05:15:51.160 align:start position:0%
yeah it does but I think it can be done
 
05:15:53.070 --> 05:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
is voting a right or a
 
05:15:55.030 --> 05:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
privilege there's no question it's a
 
05:15:58.270 --> 05:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
right okay thank you um with that thank
 
05:16:00.590 --> 05:16:00.600 align:start position:0%

to ur a membership agreement with the
 
05:16:14.910 --> 05:16:14.920 align:start position:0%

center going to recognize um uh Aubrey

freem Freedman we're going to come back
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
to you I I told you we would come back I
 
05:16:27.548 --> 05:16:27.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:30.910 --> 05:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
long uh Mr chairman committee members uh
 
05:16:32.868 --> 05:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
Aubrey readman I live in Bridgewater
 
05:16:35.628 --> 05:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
private citizen I speak in opposition to
 
05:16:40.270 --> 05:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
this bill um first of all the main
 
05:16:43.070 --> 05:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
purpose stated to eliminate duplicate
 
05:16:46.270 --> 05:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
you know possible uh duplicate voting is
 
05:16:50.110 --> 05:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
is a good uh that's a commendable goal
 
05:16:53.070 --> 05:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
um however trying to register every
 
05:16:57.430 --> 05:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
single voter who's eligible that to
 
05:17:00.708 --> 05:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
me uh seems like an impossible and that
 
05:17:03.150 --> 05:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
seems the more bigger part of this bill
 
05:17:06.948 --> 05:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
trying to register everybody and at
 
05:17:10.590 --> 05:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
significant cost I mean personally when
 
05:17:13.030 --> 05:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
there's an election you see signs out
 
05:17:15.190 --> 05:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
you know there's an election coming you
 
05:17:17.470 --> 05:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
it's in the news and there's ads and you
 
05:17:20.350 --> 05:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
can't miss the signs so for a person to
 
05:17:23.030 --> 05:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
not know that an election is coming if
 
05:17:26.990 --> 05:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
they're interested to vote they will
 
05:17:29.110 --> 05:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
contact their town clerk ask somebody
 
05:17:32.510 --> 05:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
how do you vote so this kind of Outreach
 
05:17:36.270 --> 05:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
effort to get everybody registered seems
 
05:17:40.548 --> 05:17:40.558 align:start position:0%
honestly silly to me and more important
 
05:17:43.030 --> 05:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
so let's say you achieve the goal of
 
05:17:45.990 --> 05:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
registering every eligible voter how are
 
05:17:47.990 --> 05:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
you going to get them to turn out on
 
05:17:50.868 --> 05:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
voting day because registering is one
 
05:17:52.350 --> 05:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
thing but you you actually want people
 
05:17:56.670 --> 05:17:56.680 align:start position:0%
to vote well I've seen our uh in our
 
05:17:58.430 --> 05:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
towns we we get the checklist
 
05:18:00.830 --> 05:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
periodically for Schoolboard elections
 
05:18:03.788 --> 05:18:03.798 align:start position:0%
and you'll see like 12 13 14 names on a
 
05:18:05.628 --> 05:18:05.638 align:start position:0%
page and especially in the March
 
05:18:08.750 --> 05:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
elections you'll see like one name shows
 
05:18:12.868 --> 05:18:12.878 align:start position:0%
up the next page nobody showed up so if
 
05:18:15.510 --> 05:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
people want to uh so this whole effort
 
05:18:17.868 --> 05:18:17.878 align:start position:0%
to register everybody to me seems a
 
05:18:20.150 --> 05:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
waste of time if they want to they'll
 
05:18:22.390 --> 05:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
find out and more important if they want
 
05:18:24.110 --> 05:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
to vote they'll vote so what are you
 
05:18:26.230 --> 05:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
going to do if you did get everybody to
 
05:18:28.150 --> 05:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
register are you also going to start
 
05:18:30.910 --> 05:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
calling everybody uh the day or day
 
05:18:32.948 --> 05:18:32.958 align:start position:0%
before the election to turn out and vote
 
05:18:35.548 --> 05:18:35.558 align:start position:0%
it would be impossible so I think that's
 
05:18:37.470 --> 05:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
one of the problems with this joining
 
05:18:41.030 --> 05:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
the Eric is total registration of
 
05:18:44.948 --> 05:18:44.958 align:start position:0%
everybody uh I also see in my mind the
 
05:18:48.270 --> 05:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
biggest problem with voting problems is
 
05:18:51.310 --> 05:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
the mail in ballots that's the real
 
05:18:54.310 --> 05:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
issue harvesting and you know there's a
 
05:18:56.548 --> 05:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
lot of problems potential problems with
 
05:18:59.708 --> 05:18:59.718 align:start position:0%
that so and this joining the Eric has
 
05:19:01.548 --> 05:19:01.558 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with that and I actually
 
05:19:04.590 --> 05:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
think it will make it worse because Eric
 
05:19:08.788 --> 05:19:08.798 align:start position:0%
wants AVR automatic voter registration
 
05:19:10.830 --> 05:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
you know from the DMV I came from
 
05:19:12.948 --> 05:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
California and that's how they do it
 
05:19:14.990 --> 05:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
there once you've registered you got
 
05:19:17.750 --> 05:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
your license or your car they mail out
 
05:19:21.470 --> 05:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
the ballots and uh there's really you
 
05:19:23.030 --> 05:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
you kind of lose control that's the
 
05:19:29.150 --> 05:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
bigger problem and um so and and they
 
05:19:31.990 --> 05:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
also opt out too if it was opt in it
 
05:19:33.670 --> 05:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be so bad but it's always opt
 
05:19:35.868 --> 05:19:35.878 align:start position:0%
out so that's the problem and this
 
05:19:37.830 --> 05:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
joining Eric isn't going to solve that
 
05:19:41.990 --> 05:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
problem at all uh what else here uh well
 
05:19:44.110 --> 05:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
the cost has been mentioned and I I
 
05:19:48.030 --> 05:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
think it's I think it was at high of
 
05:19:50.190 --> 05:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
174,000 I think they're going to need
 
05:19:52.230 --> 05:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
more staff than just one person to try
 
05:19:56.030 --> 05:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
to contact 95% of every eligible voter
 
05:19:57.830 --> 05:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
so I think the costs are a little bit
 
05:20:01.430 --> 05:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
low and it did say uncertain cost too so
 
05:20:05.708 --> 05:20:05.718 align:start position:0%
that's a problem um also
 
05:20:08.670 --> 05:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
um the Eric reports I've looked at the
 
05:20:11.708 --> 05:20:11.718 align:start position:0%
website and it has all their their stats
 
05:20:14.948 --> 05:20:14.958 align:start position:0%
and shows for the different states uh
 
05:20:18.230 --> 05:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
possible uh duplications but those are
 
05:20:21.150 --> 05:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
possible duplications I'm curious how
 
05:20:24.110 --> 05:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
many actual convictions did it actually
 
05:20:26.548 --> 05:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
did the reports really turn into and has
 
05:20:29.150 --> 05:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
been mentioned there's very few people
 
05:20:31.110 --> 05:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
who really vote in two different
 
05:20:34.030 --> 05:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
different places I mean it just I mean
 
05:20:35.910 --> 05:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
your one vote the chance of getting
 
05:20:39.070 --> 05:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
caught um is so silly I don't think it
 
05:20:41.788 --> 05:20:41.798 align:start position:0%
but as I say the mailin ballots there is
 
05:20:44.030 --> 05:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
kind of some value in trying to play
 
05:20:45.708 --> 05:20:45.718 align:start position:0%
around with that you know the harvesting
 
05:20:48.670 --> 05:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
and everything and lastly just the data
 
05:20:51.190 --> 05:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
sharing what could possibly go wrong
 
05:20:54.030 --> 05:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
with data sharing so that in itself
 
05:20:57.750 --> 05:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
would be enough to uh I think it's not a
 
05:20:59.868 --> 05:20:59.878 align:start position:0%
good idea and that's why I oppose the
 
05:21:01.628 --> 05:21:01.638 align:start position:0%
bill will you be taking questions yes
 
05:21:03.788 --> 05:21:03.798 align:start position:0%
please uh representative bone recognize
 
05:21:05.190 --> 05:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:21:08.070 --> 05:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
taking the question you mentioned rights
 
05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
um just like any other right isn't it up
 
05:21:14.830 --> 05:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
to the citizen to exercise that right
 
05:21:16.628 --> 05:21:16.638 align:start position:0%
right or or choose not to a lot of
 
05:21:18.868 --> 05:21:18.878 align:start position:0%
people are just not interested in leave
 
05:21:22.868 --> 05:21:22.878 align:start position:0%
them alone they it's there I just cannot
 
05:21:25.670 --> 05:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
see that it's that hard to registered
 
05:21:29.390 --> 05:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
and if you move to a new uh area you're
 
05:21:30.708 --> 05:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
if you're interested if you're not
 
05:21:32.590 --> 05:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
interested interested you won't bother
 
05:21:35.750 --> 05:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
with it thank you further
 
05:21:38.150 --> 05:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
questions I'll I'll follow up with

representative BM are you aware of any
 
05:21:40.628 --> 05:21:40.638 align:start position:0%
other rights that are automatically
 
05:21:42.548 --> 05:21:42.558 align:start position:0%
granted by going to the DMV such as do
 
05:21:44.948 --> 05:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
we give people a gun exercise are second
 
05:21:44.958 --> 05:21:46.750 align:start position:0%

research in

has identified as increased among 31
 
05:22:32.510 --> 05:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
States from 34 million to 6 60 million
 
05:22:34.190 --> 05:22:34.200 align:start position:0%

05:22:38.070 --> 05:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
39.3 million voter record updates to
 
05:22:41.590 --> 05:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
name only two G categories of
 
05:22:44.670 --> 05:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
reports this and much more information
 
05:22:46.670 --> 05:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
state election officials would otherwise
 
05:22:48.548 --> 05:22:48.558 align:start position:0%
be required to collect from various
 
05:22:51.470 --> 05:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
state and government agencies at its own
 
05:22:53.868 --> 05:22:53.878 align:start position:0%
expense suggesting there are cost
 
05:22:56.590 --> 05:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
savings to be had to offset the cost of
 
05:22:59.030 --> 05:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
membership in
 
05:23:03.430 --> 05:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
Eric those fees 2020 were $25,000 as a
 
05:23:06.990 --> 05:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
one-time fee $220,000 per year
 
05:23:10.628 --> 05:23:10.638 align:start position:0%
membership and an estimated $50,000 in
 
05:23:13.990 --> 05:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
yearly administrative costs costs that
 
05:23:16.750 --> 05:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
appear very reasonable giving uh given
 
05:23:18.548 --> 05:23:18.558 align:start position:0%
the ongoing
 
05:23:22.190 --> 05:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
benefits I do not have an updated fee
 
05:23:25.948 --> 05:23:25.958 align:start position:0%
schedule some unlikely members of Eric
 
05:23:31.350 --> 05:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
include Alaska Arizona Georgia Kentucky
 
05:23:35.788 --> 05:23:35.798 align:start position:0%
South Carolina Utah and Wisconsin with
 
05:23:39.230 --> 05:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
an additional 18 states utilizing the
 
05:23:43.390 --> 05:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
research of this public charity
 
05:23:46.910 --> 05:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
nonprofit its three-page PDF sets out
 
05:23:49.430 --> 05:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
the prolific security systems used to
 
05:23:51.990 --> 05:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
protect the Integrity of voter
 
05:23:54.670 --> 05:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
information and of its own work
 
05:23:57.430 --> 05:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
product our Secretary of State's office
 
05:24:00.868 --> 05:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
was once a member of the now defunct
 
05:24:03.788 --> 05:24:03.798 align:start position:0%
Kansas cross check program despite
 
05:24:06.670 --> 05:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
public concerns from voter protection
 
05:24:09.470 --> 05:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
Advocates that its system was highly
 
05:24:13.510 --> 05:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
suspect and inferior to Eric it can be
 
05:24:15.628 --> 05:24:15.638 align:start position:0%
fairly stated the office of the
 
05:24:18.510 --> 05:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State relatively recently
 
05:24:20.948 --> 05:24:20.958 align:start position:0%
therefore supported the concept of
 
05:24:23.868 --> 05:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
outside assistance in maintaining
 
05:24:27.868 --> 05:24:27.878 align:start position:0%
accurate voter roles obviously you've
 
05:24:29.750 --> 05:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
you've heard the secretary
 
05:24:29.760 --> 05:24:31.390 align:start position:0%
you've heard the secretary
testify

05:24:31.390 --> 05:24:31.400 align:start position:0%
testify
 
05:24:34.150 --> 05:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
quoting Eric's executive director quote
 
05:24:37.270 --> 05:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
utilizing these four data sources Eric
 
05:24:39.990 --> 05:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
provides its members with reports that
 
05:24:42.750 --> 05:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
identify inaccurate or out-of-date voter
 
05:24:46.350 --> 05:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
registration records deceased voters
 
05:24:48.750 --> 05:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who appear to be eligible to
 
05:24:52.110 --> 05:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
vote but who are not yet registered and
 
05:24:54.868 --> 05:24:54.878 align:start position:0%
possible cases of illegal
 
05:24:57.470 --> 05:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
voting I suggest utilization of this
 
05:25:00.350 --> 05:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
product is a win for voters and the
 
05:25:00.360 --> 05:25:02.030 align:start position:0%
product is a win for voters and the

reports from the data comparisons
 
05:27:16.590 --> 05:27:16.600 align:start position:0%

registration system membership in Eric
 
05:27:46.270 --> 05:27:46.280 align:start position:0%
is a secure logical way to improve and
 
05:27:48.350 --> 05:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
modernize the maintenance of our
 
05:27:50.788 --> 05:27:50.798 align:start position:0%

Manchester New Hampshire uh here to
 
05:28:18.350 --> 05:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
testify and support of this bill uh I
 
05:28:19.990 --> 05:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
feel like there's a bit of whiplash
 
05:28:21.788 --> 05:28:21.798 align:start position:0%
coming before this committee today where
 
05:28:23.150 --> 05:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
I've heard some testimony that
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
apparently uh allegations of voter fraud
 
05:28:28.150 --> 05:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
are no longer a problem in the state
 
05:28:31.548 --> 05:28:31.558 align:start position:0%
despite many years and many many bills
 
05:28:34.390 --> 05:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
and many court cases some of them
 
05:28:36.868 --> 05:28:36.878 align:start position:0%
costing the state over $3 million to
 
05:28:40.310 --> 05:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
litigate um and an attempt to find and
 
05:28:42.948 --> 05:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
strengthen our elections when in reality
 
05:28:45.190 --> 05:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
those efforts only disenfranchised
 
05:28:46.990 --> 05:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
eligible voters in the state so one
 
05:28:47.000 --> 05:28:47.788 align:start position:0%
eligible voters in the state so one
would

05:28:47.788 --> 05:28:47.798 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:28:51.150 --> 05:28:51.160 align:start position:0%
assume a program like Eric a bipartisan
 
05:28:51.160 --> 05:28:53.350 align:start position:0%
assume a program like Eric a bipartisan
proven

05:28:53.350 --> 05:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
proven
 
05:28:56.030 --> 05:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
program would not be something that this
 
05:28:57.628 --> 05:28:57.638 align:start position:0%
committee could come together on I am
 
05:28:59.310 --> 05:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
excited this year that there is some
 
05:29:01.670 --> 05:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
bipartisan uh representation on this
 
05:29:04.670 --> 05:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
bill but it is my understanding that the
 
05:29:07.150 --> 05:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
shared values of this committee include
 
05:29:08.788 --> 05:29:08.798 align:start position:0%
supporting our local election officials
 
05:29:10.910 --> 05:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
by having more accurate clean voter
 
05:29:13.910 --> 05:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
lists a shared value that came forward
 
05:29:16.110 --> 05:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
during the committee on voter confidence
 
05:29:18.150 --> 05:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
put together by the Secretary of State
 
05:29:19.910 --> 05:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
as a recommendation for this committee
 
05:29:22.430 --> 05:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
to take seriously this session uh to
 
05:29:25.310 --> 05:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
catch possible cases of voter fraud I
 
05:29:27.030 --> 05:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
grew up in the state hearing about buses
 
05:29:29.350 --> 05:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
coming in from Massachusetts carrying
 
05:29:31.910 --> 05:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
voters in let's find out that's all
 
05:29:33.708 --> 05:29:33.718 align:start position:0%
we're asking Massachusetts is a member
 
05:29:36.230 --> 05:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
of Eric after the election we could have
 
05:29:39.910 --> 05:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
a report not months later weeks later to
 
05:29:41.470 --> 05:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
hand to our attorney general to say hey
 
05:29:43.830 --> 05:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
let's go investigate these the these
 
05:29:46.270 --> 05:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
possible cases Georgia just announced
 
05:29:48.708 --> 05:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
today that they have uh the Secretary of
 
05:29:51.190 --> 05:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
State Republican Brad raffensberger
 
05:29:53.110 --> 05:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
because of their membership and Eric
 
05:29:55.350 --> 05:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
identified 17 possible cases of voter
 
05:29:56.910 --> 05:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
fraud across the state which they handed
 
05:29:58.628 --> 05:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
down to the Attorney General's office
 
05:30:00.628 --> 05:30:00.638 align:start position:0%
for them or the State's Attorneys to go
 
05:30:02.910 --> 05:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
out and investigate we talk about voter
 
05:30:05.910 --> 05:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
confidence we talk about ending this
 
05:30:07.510 --> 05:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
distraction of a conversation about
 
05:30:09.310 --> 05:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
voter fraud in the state we have an
 
05:30:12.070 --> 05:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity we talk about folks who vote
 
05:30:13.750 --> 05:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
for the first time perhaps with an outof
 
05:30:16.110 --> 05:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
state license that makes some people
 
05:30:18.190 --> 05:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable I can understand that on a
 
05:30:21.830 --> 05:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
human level did you know that using data
 
05:30:25.510 --> 05:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
from 2016 from an nhpr report that over
 
05:30:28.270 --> 05:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
75% of out ofate IDs that were used in
 
05:30:30.948 --> 05:30:30.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in 2016 came from states
 
05:30:33.750 --> 05:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
that are also members of Eric
 
05:30:36.070 --> 05:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
Ergo after the election people are
 
05:30:37.430 --> 05:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
saying hey what are all these out of
 
05:30:39.390 --> 05:30:39.400 align:start position:0%
state licenses we could as a state
 
05:30:43.948 --> 05:30:43.958 align:start position:0%
within 75% identify oo Mike O'Brien
 
05:30:47.230 --> 05:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
voted in two in New Hampshire and Maine
 
05:30:48.670 --> 05:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts we' be able to know
 
05:30:50.070 --> 05:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
that how many Mike O'Brien are there in
 
05:30:52.230 --> 05:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
New hampsh I know there's I know there
 
05:30:56.670 --> 05:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
at least one but we know a lot so I say
 
05:30:59.510 --> 05:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
this because and I and I understand this
 
05:31:00.670 --> 05:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire
 
05:31:03.150 --> 05:31:03.160 align:start position:0%
we like to think we are perhaps unique
 
05:31:05.548 --> 05:31:05.558 align:start position:0%
in our desire to protect data and
 
05:31:08.548 --> 05:31:08.558 align:start position:0%
information of our citizens I think we
 
05:31:12.350 --> 05:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
are all adults to assume that the 25
 
05:31:14.310 --> 05:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
other states in the that are part of
 
05:31:16.708 --> 05:31:16.718 align:start position:0%
Eric also want to protect their voters
 
05:31:19.190 --> 05:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
information as well and if that question
 
05:31:21.510 --> 05:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
lingers for you as a Committee Member
 
05:31:24.510 --> 05:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
you do not have to wander in absentia
 
05:31:26.510 --> 05:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
you can call your colleagues in Vermont
 
05:31:28.990 --> 05:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
in Maine in Massachusetts in Rhode
 
05:31:31.430 --> 05:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
Island we we can get answers to these
 
05:31:34.708 --> 05:31:34.718 align:start position:0%
questions what we cannot do outside of
 
05:31:36.628 --> 05:31:36.638 align:start position:0%
Eric is get the benefits that this
 
05:31:39.628 --> 05:31:39.638 align:start position:0%
unique proven secure program
 
05:31:43.030 --> 05:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
delivers so I really hope and despite
 
05:31:44.990 --> 05:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
and the last thing I'll say here is on
 
05:31:46.628 --> 05:31:46.638 align:start position:0%
why states have
 
05:31:49.230 --> 05:31:49.240 align:start position:0%
left we've been tiptoeing around it it's
 
05:31:50.910 --> 05:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
because certain Republican states think
 
05:31:53.788 --> 05:31:53.798 align:start position:0%
George Soros pays for this
 
05:31:57.990 --> 05:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
program it is lunacy it is not rooted in
 
05:32:01.110 --> 05:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
reality it gives credence to big lie
 
05:32:03.190 --> 05:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theories that this committee
 
05:32:05.190 --> 05:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
is working to push back against and I
 
05:32:07.190 --> 05:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
know that that is a bipartisan agreement
 
05:32:08.708 --> 05:32:08.718 align:start position:0%
that that is not how we run elections in
 
05:32:08.718 --> 05:32:09.750 align:start position:0%
that that is not how we run elections in
the

05:32:09.750 --> 05:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:32:13.030 --> 05:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
state so this is an opportunity not only
 
05:32:14.430 --> 05:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire the first in the
 
05:32:16.910 --> 05:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
nation state which we pounded our chess
 
05:32:19.670 --> 05:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
about how we do democracy best in the
 
05:32:20.830 --> 05:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
country and that's why we should have
 
05:32:22.030 --> 05:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
the first in the
 
05:32:26.310 --> 05:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
nation let's match that by showing the
 
05:32:28.990 --> 05:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
country that we will not cave to these
 
05:32:31.590 --> 05:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theories and instead take a
 
05:32:33.390 --> 05:32:33.400 align:start position:0%
really strong step and shift the
 
05:32:36.510 --> 05:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
dialogue towards no this once sleepy
 
05:32:39.310 --> 05:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
program that started in 2012 is in fact
 
05:32:42.548 --> 05:32:42.558 align:start position:0%
what it is which is an opportunity to
 
05:32:44.628 --> 05:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
help our local election officials catch
 
05:32:47.030 --> 05:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
cases of voter fraud and heaven forbid
 
05:32:48.948 --> 05:32:48.958 align:start position:0%
enfranchise eligible but unregistered
 
05:32:51.750 --> 05:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
voters which as a downside to this bill
 
05:32:53.270 --> 05:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
is pretty antithetical to what it means
 
05:32:55.830 --> 05:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
to be a grand estator in my opinion but
 
05:32:57.230 --> 05:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
I'll leave that to to you all
 
05:32:59.788 --> 05:32:59.798 align:start position:0%
individually and I'll stop there will
 
05:33:02.150 --> 05:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
you be taking questions I'd love
 
05:33:04.270 --> 05:33:04.280 align:start position:0%
to are there
 
05:33:07.910 --> 05:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
questions um representative weary yes
 
05:33:10.708 --> 05:33:10.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Meyer um so what are the
 
05:33:12.350 --> 05:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
origins of
 
05:33:15.470 --> 05:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
of Eric how did it come about how was it
 
05:33:17.708 --> 05:33:17.718 align:start position:0%
started and what was what were the
 
05:33:20.270 --> 05:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
funding that contributed to its Origins
 
05:33:22.030 --> 05:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
the Pew charitable trust was the
 
05:33:23.990 --> 05:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
original entity that I believe seed
 
05:33:26.868 --> 05:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
funded the project um but since then um
 
05:33:28.708 --> 05:33:28.718 align:start position:0%
has grown out to be just administered by
 
05:33:31.868 --> 05:33:31.878 align:start position:0%
the member states but 20 12 recognizing
 
05:33:35.310 --> 05:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
that states needed a tool to combat
 
05:33:37.990 --> 05:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
these lies of voter fraud and to also
 
05:33:39.350 --> 05:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
identify a problem that our local
 
05:33:41.390 --> 05:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
election officials were having of just
 
05:33:43.750 --> 05:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
like cluttered up voter roles so that's
 
05:33:45.510 --> 05:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
that's the Nexus of
 
05:33:48.948 --> 05:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
it followup if no one else wants to go
 
05:33:51.670 --> 05:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
sure who was one of the main
 
05:33:54.310 --> 05:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
contributors to the Pew charitable
 
05:33:57.990 --> 05:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
trust have their 990 in front of me
 
05:34:00.230 --> 05:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
would you would it surprise you if was
 
05:34:00.240 --> 05:34:02.150 align:start position:0%
would you would it surprise you if was
George

05:34:02.150 --> 05:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
George
 
05:34:02.160 --> 05:34:05.868 align:start position:0%
George
Soros

05:34:05.868 --> 05:34:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:09.150 --> 05:34:09.160 align:start position:0%
no on that bombshell um any other
 
05:34:11.750 --> 05:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
questions um and and I I think we should
 
05:34:13.230 --> 05:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
we will take these accusations against
 
05:34:15.390 --> 05:34:15.400 align:start position:0%
Mr O'Brien very seriously you know I
 
05:34:17.070 --> 05:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
mean can I respond I mean yeah sure go
 
05:34:19.190 --> 05:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
for it I mean is is the supposition then
 
05:34:20.670 --> 05:34:20.680 align:start position:0%
that it is is that your supposition
 
05:34:22.230 --> 05:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative that it is paid for that
 
05:34:23.868 --> 05:34:23.878 align:start position:0%
is a it is a
 
05:34:26.270 --> 05:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
liberal think tank that is trying to
 
05:34:28.270 --> 05:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
skew our elections CU I think the the
 
05:34:30.270 --> 05:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
evidence is pretty clear against that
 
05:34:33.548 --> 05:34:33.558 align:start position:0%
and I think perpetuating those types of
 
05:34:36.070 --> 05:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theories which is what it is
 
05:34:36.080 --> 05:34:37.350 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theories which is what it is
is

05:34:37.350 --> 05:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:34:39.430 --> 05:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
dangerous I I think we'll end that there
 
05:34:40.750 --> 05:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
I think you can imagine the members a
 
05:34:42.190 --> 05:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
stance on that given the pointed
 
05:34:44.548 --> 05:34:44.558 align:start position:0%
question so um any other questions from
 
05:34:44.558 --> 05:34:45.150 align:start position:0%
question so um any other questions from
the

05:34:45.150 --> 05:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:34:47.190 --> 05:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
committee nope seeing none thank you
 
05:34:48.470 --> 05:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's always good to see
 
05:34:52.070 --> 05:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
you um next up is Mara Chappelle I got
 
05:34:56.510 --> 05:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:58.788 --> 05:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
name better and
 
05:34:58.798 --> 05:35:01.548 align:start position:0%
name better and
better

05:35:01.548 --> 05:35:01.558 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:35:05.030 --> 05:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
so two for two Mora and nette Chappelle
 
05:35:06.910 --> 05:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
um Jefferson New Hampshire I wasn't
 
05:35:08.868 --> 05:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
again not prepared to speak but based on
 
05:35:12.830 --> 05:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
something he said I wanted to clarify um
 
05:35:15.030 --> 05:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
the buses from Massachusetts and I hate
 
05:35:16.390 --> 05:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
and those are the people that are on my
 
05:35:17.948 --> 05:35:17.958 align:start position:0%
side they always say that and I'm like
 
05:35:19.910 --> 05:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
sh don't say that because it's not true
 
05:35:21.788 --> 05:35:21.798 align:start position:0%
we all know it's not true but what
 
05:35:24.788 --> 05:35:24.798 align:start position:0%
happens is coaz County again where where
 
05:35:27.628 --> 05:35:27.638 align:start position:0%
I am we are routinely all of our
 
05:35:29.430 --> 05:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
elections are routinely one two three
 
05:35:29.440 --> 05:35:30.390 align:start position:0%
elections are routinely one two three
votes

05:35:30.390 --> 05:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
votes
 
05:35:32.310 --> 05:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
because was that small so one two three
 
05:35:34.670 --> 05:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
people hugely matters the rest of the
 
05:35:38.628 --> 05:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
state saw it this in 2022 how many ties
 
05:35:39.990 --> 05:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
were there I think there was a record
 
05:35:42.270 --> 05:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
number of um recounts because that's how
 
05:35:45.070 --> 05:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
close so one two three votes matters so
 
05:35:47.190 --> 05:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's not the it's not the buses coming
 
05:35:49.070 --> 05:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
in and AFF in the state it's the
 
05:35:51.590 --> 05:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
short-term rental owners who vote using
 
05:35:54.190 --> 05:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
their their their vacation house address
 
05:35:56.270 --> 05:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
they vote absentee from Massachusetts
 
05:35:58.830 --> 05:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
and Connecticut and wherever else it's
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
the out of state Rel cuz I'm from
 
05:36:02.470 --> 05:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and my my family goes I
 
05:36:03.590 --> 05:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't vote because it doesn't matter in
 
05:36:05.470 --> 05:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it would be very easy for
 
05:36:07.948 --> 05:36:07.958 align:start position:0%
me to go yeah they live with me right
 
05:36:09.350 --> 05:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
small town though I would get busted
 
05:36:11.670 --> 05:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
when we all see each other um I have
 
05:36:13.708 --> 05:36:13.718 align:start position:0%
painstakingly every election for the
 
05:36:15.230 --> 05:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
last few years I get every voter
 
05:36:18.110 --> 05:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
checklist every mock voter checklist of
 
05:36:19.910 --> 05:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
coaz County and go through them and
 
05:36:21.110 --> 05:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
cross check them against all the
 
05:36:22.628 --> 05:36:22.638 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals and cross check them
 
05:36:25.470 --> 05:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
against anything that I can and
 
05:36:28.628 --> 05:36:28.638 align:start position:0%
Jefferson has routinely 10 to 15 Twin
 
05:36:30.830 --> 05:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
Mountain has almost 30 Randolph has
 
05:36:33.270 --> 05:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
almost 30 right there that's three reps
 
05:36:35.310 --> 05:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
that's three reps that get
 
05:36:37.788 --> 05:36:37.798 align:start position:0%

05:36:41.948 --> 05:36:41.958 align:start position:0%
elections one two three hugely matters
 
05:36:43.830 --> 05:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
how many things have been decided by our
 
05:36:45.750 --> 05:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
thing so it's not the buses from
 
05:36:48.150 --> 05:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it's still the little guys
 
05:36:50.310 --> 05:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
and also um actually the the real point
 
05:36:51.548 --> 05:36:51.558 align:start position:0%
I meant to make I don't mean to ramble
 
05:36:55.830 --> 05:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm new at this um it's not
 
05:36:56.910 --> 05:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not they voted in
 
05:36:59.190 --> 05:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and up here that's what
 
05:37:01.350 --> 05:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
people get fixated on they'll vote here
 
05:37:03.590 --> 05:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
instead of Massachusetts which is still
 
05:37:06.590 --> 05:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
against the law but gets brushed aside
 
05:37:08.470 --> 05:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
stop they think with the what he was
 
05:37:10.350 --> 05:37:10.360 align:start position:0%
saying is to just only if they voted in
 
05:37:12.350 --> 05:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
both places they're voting up here
 
05:37:14.390 --> 05:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
instead of their home state and it just
 
05:37:17.830 --> 05:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen to be by bus so will you
 
05:37:19.990 --> 05:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
be taking questions if anyone has them
 
05:37:22.030 --> 05:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions seeing
 
05:37:24.548 --> 05:37:24.558 align:start position:0%

our voter confidence in the final report
 
05:38:19.910 --> 05:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the Secretary of State's special
 
05:38:21.990 --> 05:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
committee on voter confidence uh the
 
05:38:24.990 --> 05:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
committee made a recommendation quote to
 
05:38:27.470 --> 05:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
have updated checklist verification and
 
05:38:29.590 --> 05:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
provide a uniform and secure checklist
 
05:38:31.788 --> 05:38:31.798 align:start position:0%
updating system Statewide that accounts
 
05:38:34.350 --> 05:38:34.360 align:start position:0%
for movein move outs and deaths New
 
05:38:36.150 --> 05:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should have cons New Hampshire
 
05:38:38.030 --> 05:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
should consider methods to determine if
 
05:38:39.628 --> 05:38:39.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens have voted in
 
05:38:42.350 --> 05:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
other states end quote Eric would
 
05:38:44.270 --> 05:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
clearly accomplish this shared goal that
 
05:38:46.270 --> 05:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
the committee identified in their
 
05:38:49.830 --> 05:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan report as you've also heard
 
05:38:52.708 --> 05:38:52.718 align:start position:0%
a recent poll conducted by the St anel
 
05:38:55.948 --> 05:38:55.958 align:start position:0%
College Survey Center revealed that 75%
 
05:38:57.910 --> 05:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
of granted State voters think that New
 
05:39:00.548 --> 05:39:00.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should join Eric and as you've
 
05:39:02.468 --> 05:39:02.478 align:start position:0%
also heard Eric has support from
 
05:39:04.548 --> 05:39:04.558 align:start position:0%
election officials across the political
 
05:39:07.708 --> 05:39:07.718 align:start position:0%
Spectrum from Georgia to Rhode Island
 
05:39:11.708 --> 05:39:11.718 align:start position:0%
who have uh relied on Eric uh to keep
 
05:39:13.670 --> 05:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
their voter roles accurate and up to
 
05:39:16.230 --> 05:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
date every state in New England is a
 
05:39:18.390 --> 05:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
member of Eric and it's beyond time for
 
05:39:21.948 --> 05:39:21.958 align:start position:0%
us to join this nonpartisan system and
 
05:39:23.628 --> 05:39:23.638 align:start position:0%
often the conversation in New Hampshire
 
05:39:26.390 --> 05:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
around voting rights uh gets mired down
 
05:39:28.430 --> 05:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
in a debate over voter fraud or
 
05:39:30.990 --> 05:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
perceived relaxed nature of our
 
05:39:32.868 --> 05:39:32.878 align:start position:0%
elections in New Hampshire this means
 
05:39:34.750 --> 05:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
that it's often younger folks or more
 
05:39:36.390 --> 05:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
transient voters who face the most
 
05:39:38.190 --> 05:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
threats to their constitutional right to
 
05:39:41.590 --> 05:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
vote because of conspiracy theories and
 
05:39:43.350 --> 05:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theory driven bills that make
 
05:39:47.548 --> 05:39:47.558 align:start position:0%
it harder and uh more costly to vote 603
 
05:39:50.628 --> 05:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
forward supports Eric because we believe
 
05:39:52.190 --> 05:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
that by providing the data needed to
 
05:39:54.628 --> 05:39:54.638 align:start position:0%
root out actual cases of voter fraud we
 
05:39:56.430 --> 05:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
would be able to focus on the continued
 
05:39:58.390 --> 05:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
Improvement of our voter confidence and
 
05:40:00.788 --> 05:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
put to bed these convers ations our
 
05:40:02.948 --> 05:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
focus should be on making elections more
 
05:40:04.510 --> 05:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
secure and efficient for folks to
 
05:40:06.150 --> 05:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
participate and having upto-date
 
05:40:08.670 --> 05:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
accurate voter registration list is key
 
05:40:10.990 --> 05:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
to maintaining our secure elections so
 
05:40:12.628 --> 05:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
we ask you you please vote a to pass on
 
05:40:14.510 --> 05:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:40:16.548 --> 05:40:16.558 align:start position:0%
1557 are there questions will you be
 
05:40:18.468 --> 05:40:18.478 align:start position:0%
taking questions certainly are there
 
05:40:20.670 --> 05:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee um I have
 
05:40:22.590 --> 05:40:22.600 align:start position:0%
one because I I I kind of warned against
 
05:40:25.390 --> 05:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
referencing this say a poll earlier but
 
05:40:27.070 --> 05:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
uh apparently we're not going to pay
 
05:40:29.990 --> 05:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
attention to that so you say it's 75% %
 
05:40:32.110 --> 05:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
of I have two questions here so youly
 
05:40:34.110 --> 05:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
75% of grand estaters believe we should
 
05:40:35.788 --> 05:40:35.798 align:start position:0%
roll in Eric do you genuinely believe
 
05:40:37.430 --> 05:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
that 75% of grand estaters know what
 
05:40:37.440 --> 05:40:39.670 align:start position:0%
that 75% of grand estaters know what
Eric

05:40:39.670 --> 05:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
Eric
 
05:40:44.190 --> 05:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
is it's a good question I think that 75%
 
05:40:45.708 --> 05:40:45.718 align:start position:0%
of granders can probably identify with
 
05:40:47.430 --> 05:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
the concept of Eric and maintaining our
 
05:40:49.670 --> 05:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
accurate voter roles in identifying
 
05:40:53.070 --> 05:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
these issues fair and my followup is s
 
05:40:55.390 --> 05:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh UNH released there a survey today
 
05:40:56.230 --> 05:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
which by the way everybody should go
 
05:40:59.468 --> 05:40:59.478 align:start position:0%
check it out um it talks about the
 
05:41:01.430 --> 05:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
support or opposing New Hampshire law
 
05:41:03.830 --> 05:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
requiring the first and Nation primary
 
05:41:06.430 --> 05:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
so 66% of graters support the first and
 
05:41:08.430 --> 05:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
Nation Primary Law are you to have me
 
05:41:10.070 --> 05:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
believe that more people in New
 
05:41:11.910 --> 05:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire support joining Eric than
 
05:41:14.310 --> 05:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
support our first in the nation primary
 
05:41:16.628 --> 05:41:16.638 align:start position:0%
that's the number say yep so if anybody
 
05:41:18.468 --> 05:41:18.478 align:start position:0%
wants I'd recommend go reading that poll
 
05:41:22.548 --> 05:41:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:28.230 --> 05:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:28.240 --> 05:41:36.788 align:start position:0%
 
Germain

05:41:36.788 --> 05:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:38.708 --> 05:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I promise I will not be
 
05:41:40.548 --> 05:41:40.558 align:start position:0%
citing any sort of polls in this
 
05:41:42.830 --> 05:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
testimony uh my name is McKenzie C
 
05:41:44.510 --> 05:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
Germain uh I'm with the New Hampshire
 
05:41:45.868 --> 05:41:45.878 align:start position:0%
campaign for voting rights and America
 
05:41:48.548 --> 05:41:48.558 align:start position:0%
votes New Hampshire um we support this
 
05:41:51.150 --> 05:41:51.160 align:start position:0%
bill hp1 1557 and New Hampshire joining
 
05:41:54.190 --> 05:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
Eric I've spent much time in front of
 
05:41:55.670 --> 05:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
this committee or listening to testimony
 
05:41:57.548 --> 05:41:57.558 align:start position:0%
and this committee spent a lot of time
 
05:41:59.430 --> 05:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh listening to the testimony that was
 
05:42:01.750 --> 05:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
brought to the 2022 committee on voter
 
05:42:04.548 --> 05:42:04.558 align:start position:0%
confidence one very common thread
 
05:42:06.468 --> 05:42:06.478 align:start position:0%
amongst all of those things was a lot of
 
05:42:08.548 --> 05:42:08.558 align:start position:0%
talk about cleaning checklists keeping
 
05:42:10.670 --> 05:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
our checklist up to date in state making
 
05:42:12.868 --> 05:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
sure that if folks move have moved out
 
05:42:14.948 --> 05:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
of a place no longer are eligible to
 
05:42:16.708 --> 05:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
vote that we are keeping our checklist
 
05:42:18.628 --> 05:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
clean clearly that should be a priority
 
05:42:20.510 --> 05:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
and I know is a priority of this
 
05:42:23.430 --> 05:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
committee um but there are often things
 
05:42:24.510 --> 05:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
that are brought up ideas that are
 
05:42:25.830 --> 05:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
brought up that are actually harmful
 
05:42:27.788 --> 05:42:27.798 align:start position:0%
because they are removing voters who
 
05:42:29.310 --> 05:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
should not be removed from the list and
 
05:42:30.670 --> 05:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
making it more difficult for them to
 
05:42:33.070 --> 05:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
cast their ballots this is a system that
 
05:42:35.750 --> 05:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
we know that is trusted um that actually
 
05:42:38.150 --> 05:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
works to address those concerns and it
 
05:42:39.788 --> 05:42:39.798 align:start position:0%
is the only system out there that does
 
05:42:42.310 --> 05:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
this between states um so we support
 
05:42:44.750 --> 05:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
this bill and hope that you all uh will
 
05:42:46.390 --> 05:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
come around supporting it as well right
 
05:42:48.230 --> 05:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
will you be taking questions sure other
 
05:42:48.948 --> 05:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:42:48.958 --> 05:42:50.030 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

05:42:50.030 --> 05:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:42:53.788 --> 05:42:53.798 align:start position:0%
wey at a recent uh Senate hearing for
 
05:42:58.230 --> 05:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
the uh interval for voter checklist
 
05:43:03.230 --> 05:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
verification they said that um only
 
05:43:05.750 --> 05:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
5% were
 
05:43:09.430 --> 05:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
removed um who didn't then rreg or who
 
05:43:12.830 --> 05:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
who then did re-register so it was 95%
 
05:43:15.390 --> 05:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
effective 5% were false positives or
 
05:43:19.350 --> 05:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
something like that where they had to um
 
05:43:22.070 --> 05:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
those particular voters had to
 
05:43:24.708 --> 05:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
reregister again so I I'm your statement
 
05:43:27.070 --> 05:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
was about you know that that a lot of
 
05:43:29.510 --> 05:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
people are being harmed by this I'm I'm
 
05:43:32.750 --> 05:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
you think 5% is is really that harmful
 
05:43:34.390 --> 05:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
register thank you for the question I
 
05:43:35.830 --> 05:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
think our current system you know is the
 
05:43:37.628 --> 05:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
10 years I know there's a lot of
 
05:43:39.670 --> 05:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
proposals to make that shorter intervals
 
05:43:41.590 --> 05:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
I think in the current system it is you
 
05:43:43.190 --> 05:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
know we wait a really long time and then
 
05:43:45.030 --> 05:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
remove a lot of people who haven't voted
 
05:43:47.590 --> 05:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
recently um there are ideas I know
 
05:43:49.590 --> 05:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
coming forward in terms of doing that
 
05:43:51.590 --> 05:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
way more fre frequently in terms of two
 
05:43:54.310 --> 05:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
years four years five years um or you
 
05:43:55.948 --> 05:43:55.958 align:start position:0%
know kind of individuals looking through
 
05:43:58.070 --> 05:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
the lists and claiming people have moved
 
05:44:00.548 --> 05:44:00.558 align:start position:0%
I think a that we can all agree on
 
05:44:02.868 --> 05:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
obviously that improves how we're
 
05:44:05.310 --> 05:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
cleaning our checklists um extra
 
05:44:07.670 --> 05:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
technology like the online voter portal
 
05:44:09.548 --> 05:44:09.558 align:start position:0%
which we're hoping um will be up and
 
05:44:12.230 --> 05:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
running in the coming years systems like
 
05:44:14.868 --> 05:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
Eric those types of things Al together
 
05:44:17.430 --> 05:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
um can lead to cleaner lists without
 
05:44:19.110 --> 05:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
additional harm but I think our current
 
05:44:21.910 --> 05:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
system you know is is not removing a
 
05:44:24.030 --> 05:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
number of people unnecessarily but it is
 
05:44:25.788 --> 05:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
also 10 years and I know there's a lot
 
05:44:27.868 --> 05:44:27.878 align:start position:0%
of support in trying to increase the
 
05:44:29.548 --> 05:44:29.558 align:start position:0%
cleanliness of lists beyond what we
 
05:44:29.558 --> 05:44:33.548 align:start position:0%
cleanliness of lists beyond what we
currently

05:44:33.548 --> 05:44:33.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:36.708 --> 05:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
do further questions from the committee
 
05:44:37.548 --> 05:44:37.558 align:start position:0%
I think you believe it or not you
 
05:44:38.670 --> 05:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
actually asked the question I would ask
 
05:44:41.270 --> 05:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
which is how do you oppose the Clint the
 
05:44:42.590 --> 05:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'll ask it again if you
 
05:44:43.750 --> 05:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
just answered that's fine but I'll ask
 
05:44:46.628 --> 05:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
more direct how do you guys ju suppose
 
05:44:49.110 --> 05:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
your position of opposing more frequent
 
05:44:51.150 --> 05:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
voter rle purges I don't really like
 
05:44:54.310 --> 05:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
that term but cleaning um based on
 
05:44:56.868 --> 05:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
inactivity with this which it's stated
 
05:44:58.750 --> 05:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
purpose is to remove voters like how do
 
05:45:00.670 --> 05:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
you guys I guess I'm trying to figure
 
05:45:02.350 --> 05:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
out how do you guys get to one but not
 
05:45:05.830 --> 05:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
the other so thank you for that um I
 
05:45:07.150 --> 05:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
think there's a difference between
 
05:45:08.708 --> 05:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
removing people just because of
 
05:45:10.270 --> 05:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
inactivity so they would have missed a
 
05:45:12.430 --> 05:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
presidential election versus removing
 
05:45:14.910 --> 05:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
folks because we have evidence that they
 
05:45:16.430 --> 05:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
have moved to another state they have
 
05:45:18.510 --> 05:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
moved to another town and using that
 
05:45:20.430 --> 05:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
kind of they are no longer eligible to
 
05:45:22.430 --> 05:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
vote there versus inactivity and that's
 
05:45:25.110 --> 05:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
the kind of difference very good answer
 
05:45:26.750 --> 05:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I was curious I was
 
05:45:28.390 --> 05:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
I was genuinely curious how how we got
 
05:45:31.708 --> 05:45:31.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:35.628 --> 05:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
Lane under um the system of
 
05:45:39.070 --> 05:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
Eric uh will we avoid the situation of
 
05:45:40.510 --> 05:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
people who've been
 
05:45:42.910 --> 05:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
purged showing up thinking they're
 
05:45:46.350 --> 05:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
registered and now we no longer if the
 
05:45:48.910 --> 05:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
pre the next bill passes we no longer
 
05:45:50.868 --> 05:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
will have affidavits and they will not
 
05:45:53.708 --> 05:45:53.718 align:start position:0%
be able to perhaps register to vote I
 
05:45:55.350 --> 05:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
will say that I am not in terms of in
 
05:45:57.868 --> 05:45:57.878 align:start position:0%
the weeds exactly how that process works
 
05:46:00.868 --> 05:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
an expert um I would hope that it would
 
05:46:03.310 --> 05:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
be you know the people who are moving or
 
05:46:05.350 --> 05:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
people who have gotten the know the
 
05:46:07.708 --> 05:46:07.718 align:start position:0%
choice to send the 30-day letters to
 
05:46:09.190 --> 05:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
folks when they are removed from the
 
05:46:11.750 --> 05:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
list town by Town more frequently so
 
05:46:13.230 --> 05:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
they can see oh nope I actually there
 
05:46:15.750 --> 05:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
was a mistake fill out that send it back
 
05:46:17.030 --> 05:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
and remove the number of people who are
 
05:46:19.390 --> 05:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
coming to the polls unknowing you know
 
05:46:20.628 --> 05:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
not knowing that they weren't
 
05:46:22.830 --> 05:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
unregistered but I think it's probably a
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
process of Eric question
 
05:46:27.110 --> 05:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
specifically question from the committee
 
05:46:30.150 --> 05:46:30.160 align:start position:0%

issues already a lot here um and uh Eric
 
05:47:22.350 --> 05:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
is the only proven system for efficient
 
05:47:24.910 --> 05:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
and secure transfer of uh sensitive
 
05:47:24.920 --> 05:47:26.230 align:start position:0%

voter

05:47:26.230 --> 05:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
voter
 
05:47:28.430 --> 05:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
information um Eric member states are
 
05:47:30.030 --> 05:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
requ required to meet the same stringent
 
05:47:32.670 --> 05:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
standards for cyber security and uh
 
05:47:34.990 --> 05:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
without joining Eric uh state would need
 
05:47:37.270 --> 05:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
to pursue um its own contracts for
 
05:47:38.708 --> 05:47:38.718 align:start position:0%
information this is in some of the
 
05:47:40.628 --> 05:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
letter uh that I had shared around with
 
05:47:43.230 --> 05:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
the committee um pursue its own
 
05:47:45.070 --> 05:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
contracts for uh information sharing
 
05:47:47.708 --> 05:47:47.718 align:start position:0%
with other states um which is costly and
 
05:47:50.110 --> 05:47:50.120 align:start position:0%
challenging so that's all I have thank
 
05:47:52.788 --> 05:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
 
05:47:54.948 --> 05:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
could you speak and I don't know if you
 
05:47:57.390 --> 05:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
have the expertise to speak to this some
 
05:47:59.910 --> 05:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
of the concerns around confidentiality
 
05:48:02.670 --> 05:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
and the sharing of that information um
 
05:48:04.430 --> 05:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
could you speak to that because I think
 
05:48:07.910 --> 05:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
it is somewhat troubling sure uh I don't
 
05:48:10.190 --> 05:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
have the expertise to speak to that in
 
05:48:12.830 --> 05:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
detail um but happy to follow up with
 
05:48:15.468 --> 05:48:15.478 align:start position:0%

05:50:23.150 --> 05:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
and this um bill has uh one sponsor Bob
 
05:50:27.468 --> 05:50:27.478 align:start position:0%
Lind that I realized he had to leave so
 
05:50:33.150 --> 05:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
um now I look at this is be sensible and
 
05:50:34.510 --> 05:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
05:50:38.548 --> 05:50:38.558 align:start position:0%
listening sensible to listen to voters
 
05:50:41.510 --> 05:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
sensible to believe our our governor
 
05:50:45.150 --> 05:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
cunu actually that has said that um
 
05:50:47.990 --> 05:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
Integrity for the voting in our
 
05:50:52.548 --> 05:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
elections is good minimal meaning
 
05:50:55.150 --> 05:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
minimal uh amount of
 
05:51:00.548 --> 05:51:00.558 align:start position:0%
Fraud and um also sensible to support
 
05:51:04.708 --> 05:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
constituents all voters all eligible
 
05:51:08.708 --> 05:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
voters and the voting rules using the
 
05:51:08.718 --> 05:51:10.310 align:start position:0%
voters and the voting rules using the
affidavits

05:51:10.310 --> 05:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
affidavits
 
05:51:13.270 --> 05:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
work they work they
 
05:51:18.070 --> 05:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
do and um on election day to register to
 
05:51:22.150 --> 05:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
work uh to uh to vote it's very popular
 
05:51:27.230 --> 05:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
to uh to register on Election Day and uh
 
05:51:29.468 --> 05:51:29.478 align:start position:0%
you know besides save a
 
05:51:33.190 --> 05:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
trip it's uh you know just think of uh
 
05:51:35.548 --> 05:51:35.558 align:start position:0%
the town hall such as Rollinsford with
 
05:51:35.558 --> 05:51:36.590 align:start position:0%
the town hall such as Rollinsford with
limited

05:51:36.590 --> 05:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
limited
 
05:51:40.310 --> 05:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
hours they really do it's like closed
 
05:51:44.190 --> 05:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays uh Mondays except this week
 
05:51:49.788 --> 05:51:49.798 align:start position:0%
um opened us 8 to one and um and then I
 
05:51:54.868 --> 05:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
think uh on Tuesday Thursday 1 to six so
 
05:51:57.628 --> 05:51:57.638 align:start position:0%
um you know trying to juggle this time
 
05:52:00.468 --> 05:52:00.478 align:start position:0%
and then get there um you know it's it
 
05:52:02.430 --> 05:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
can be
 
05:52:06.270 --> 05:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
difficult and but the rules are followed
 
05:52:10.190 --> 05:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
using affidavits they are and we really
 
05:52:13.590 --> 05:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
take pride in following the rules from
 
05:52:15.990 --> 05:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
secretary scanland uh
 
05:52:20.110 --> 05:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
department and Trisha that heads New
 
05:52:23.270 --> 05:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire votes the election net we
 
05:52:26.390 --> 05:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
follow that really uh we take pride in
 
05:52:31.708 --> 05:52:31.718 align:start position:0%
following that and so uh I'll say what
 
05:52:36.110 --> 05:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
is sensible is to kill this bill any
 
05:52:38.310 --> 05:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:52:41.270 --> 05:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing none thank you thank
 
05:52:44.110 --> 05:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
you it's good to see you again thank you
 
05:52:48.150 --> 05:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
um next up is Nancy uh
 
05:52:53.750 --> 05:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:56.910 --> 05:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
trying my name is Nancy marashio I live
 
05:52:59.510 --> 05:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
in New London and I'm representing the
 
05:53:02.310 --> 05:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
League of Women Voters in fact I am
 
05:53:05.190 --> 05:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
reading the testimony of our president
 
05:53:08.030 --> 05:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
Liz tentarelli who could not be here and
 
05:53:09.948 --> 05:53:09.958 align:start position:0%
we'll pass out copies
 
05:53:12.230 --> 05:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
afterwards afterwards because I'm a
 
05:53:14.430 --> 05:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
teacher and I know you'd read if I pass
 
05:53:16.468 --> 05:53:16.478 align:start position:0%
them out
 
05:53:18.990 --> 05:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
now the mission of the League of Women
 
05:53:23.070 --> 05:53:23.080 align:start position:0%
Voters is empowering voters we try to
 
05:53:26.230 --> 05:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
explain in the simplest way while still
 
05:53:29.270 --> 05:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
being accurate how to to register and
 
05:53:32.350 --> 05:53:32.360 align:start position:0%
how to obtain a ballot removing the
 
05:53:35.350 --> 05:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
affidavit option for people who do not
 
05:53:38.390 --> 05:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
have all the documentation asked for
 
05:53:40.948 --> 05:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
means our instructions now will have to
 
05:53:44.110 --> 05:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
be get every single document you can
 
05:53:47.070 --> 05:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
find before you go to register and even
 
05:53:50.110 --> 05:53:50.120 align:start position:0%
then they might not be enough voting in
 
05:53:53.468 --> 05:53:53.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is for very organized
 
05:53:56.788 --> 05:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
only the proof of domicile section of
 
05:54:01.750 --> 05:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
this bill s sounds very like sb3 from
 
05:54:05.150 --> 05:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
2017 which league and others challenged
 
05:54:09.390 --> 05:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
in court ultimately we won we pointed
 
05:54:12.030 --> 05:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
out there some Oddities including this
 
05:54:15.430 --> 05:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
from today's Bill an applicant whose
 
05:54:18.868 --> 05:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
domicile is at an abode of another and
 
05:54:21.310 --> 05:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
whose name is not listed on the document
 
05:54:24.430 --> 05:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
offered as proof of domicile May provide
 
05:54:27.350 --> 05:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
a written statement from a person who is
 
05:54:30.230 --> 05:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
listed as owner property manager or
 
05:54:32.628 --> 05:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
tenant on the document that the
 
05:54:35.788 --> 05:54:35.798 align:start position:0%
applicant resides at that address signed
 
05:54:38.708 --> 05:54:38.718 align:start position:0%
by that person under penalty of voting
 
05:54:42.548 --> 05:54:42.558 align:start position:0%
fraud if false information is provided
 
05:54:45.310 --> 05:54:45.320 align:start position:0%
in other words the potential voter
 
05:54:48.190 --> 05:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
cannot sign an affidavit that he is
 
05:54:50.230 --> 05:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
temporarily living with a friend or
 
05:54:53.468 --> 05:54:53.478 align:start position:0%
relative but the owner or tenant of the
 
05:54:56.510 --> 05:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
property can sign an affidavit to that
 
05:54:59.948 --> 05:54:59.958 align:start position:0%
effect and be believed but not the
 
05:55:02.910 --> 05:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
prospective voter himself how in the
 
05:55:05.548 --> 05:55:05.558 align:start position:0%
world does that say to new voters
 
05:55:08.590 --> 05:55:08.600 align:start position:0%
welcome to the representative democracy
 
05:55:11.670 --> 05:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
world it is documentary proof of
 
05:55:14.910 --> 05:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
citizenship that disturbs me most
 
05:55:17.310 --> 05:55:17.320 align:start position:0%
today's bill says that election
 
05:55:19.628 --> 05:55:19.638 align:start position:0%
officials shall accept from the
 
05:55:22.190 --> 05:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
applicant any one of the following as
 
05:55:24.948 --> 05:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
proof of citizenship the applicant's
 
05:55:27.070 --> 05:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
birth certificate passport
 
05:55:30.030 --> 05:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
naturalization papers if the applicant
 
05:55:33.190 --> 05:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
is a naturalized citizen or any other
 
05:55:33.200 --> 05:55:34.468 align:start position:0%
is a naturalized citizen or any other
reasonable

05:55:34.468 --> 05:55:34.478 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
05:55:36.590 --> 05:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
documentation which indicates the
 
05:55:39.868 --> 05:55:39.878 align:start position:0%
applicant is a United States citizen
 
05:55:42.150 --> 05:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
currently one can list one's place of
 
05:55:44.990 --> 05:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
birth and sign the affidavit that it is
 
05:55:47.708 --> 05:55:47.718 align:start position:0%
accurate and if one was born in the US
 
05:55:50.990 --> 05:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
all is good but without the affidavit
 
05:55:53.030 --> 05:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
option if a person does not have a
 
05:55:55.990 --> 05:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
passport and let's be real many people
 
05:55:57.990 --> 05:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
can't afford to travel internet
 
05:56:00.990 --> 05:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
nationally and never get a passport how
 
05:56:04.430 --> 05:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
does a married woman for example prove
 
05:56:07.350 --> 05:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
citizenship her birth certificate likely
 
05:56:09.948 --> 05:56:09.958 align:start position:0%
has a different last name does she have
 
05:56:11.590 --> 05:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
to present that with her marriage
 
05:56:14.070 --> 05:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
license to prove she's one and the
 
05:56:16.788 --> 05:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
same and when is that birth certificate
 
05:56:18.708 --> 05:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
and marriage license after all these
 
05:56:21.070 --> 05:56:21.080 align:start position:0%
years when she's moving to a retirement
 
05:56:24.110 --> 05:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
home in a new state just for the record
 
05:56:26.868 --> 05:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
a driver's license does not prove
 
05:56:29.548 --> 05:56:29.558 align:start position:0%
citizenship other potential voters could
 
05:56:32.350 --> 05:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
also be affected people who became
 
05:56:35.468 --> 05:56:35.478 align:start position:0%
naturalized citizens as Miners did so
 
05:56:39.110 --> 05:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
under their families ages they may not
 
05:56:42.030 --> 05:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
have those papers young firsttime
 
05:56:44.670 --> 05:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
registrants may like my grandson several
 
05:56:47.510 --> 05:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
years ago text their moms from the polls
 
05:56:50.948 --> 05:56:50.958 align:start position:0%
and ask do I have a birth certificate
 
05:56:52.670 --> 05:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
well of course they do but they don't
 
05:56:54.868 --> 05:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
carry it around and Mom and the
 
05:56:58.110 --> 05:56:58.120 align:start position:0%
certificate may be many miles away the
 
05:57:00.590 --> 05:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
fact is that most people now register on
 
05:57:03.390 --> 05:57:03.400 align:start position:0%
the day of election at the polling place
 
05:57:05.910 --> 05:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
if they arrive without paper proof of
 
05:57:07.708 --> 05:57:07.718 align:start position:0%
each of the four
 
05:57:11.110 --> 05:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
qualifications ID age citizenship and
 
05:57:14.070 --> 05:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
where they live they will been be denied
 
05:57:16.030 --> 05:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
the right to register if this bill
 
05:57:19.750 --> 05:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
passes voter registration should not be
 
05:57:23.510 --> 05:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
a gauntlet this bill is still hunting
 
05:57:26.990 --> 05:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
for a problem to solve an article in the
 
05:57:28.510 --> 05:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire business Business review
 
05:57:31.868 --> 05:57:31.878 align:start position:0%
from last November listed the 15 cases
 
05:57:35.190 --> 05:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
of fraudulent voting prosecuted in New
 
05:57:39.948 --> 05:57:39.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from 2016 to
 
05:57:43.350 --> 05:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
2021 I used to be able to find the list
 
05:57:45.830 --> 05:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
of those cases on the Secretary of
 
05:57:48.670 --> 05:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
States or attorney general's website but
 
05:57:51.990 --> 05:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
can't seem to find it anymore for most
 
05:57:54.350 --> 05:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
of those cases the person who voted more
 
05:57:56.990 --> 05:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
than once in the same election very
 
05:57:59.548 --> 05:57:59.558 align:start position:0%
likely was able to present the documents
 
05:58:02.830 --> 05:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
discussed in today's Bill those cases
 
05:58:05.110 --> 05:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
involve people with two abodes in
 
05:58:08.310 --> 05:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
different places of course that's wrong
 
05:58:10.468 --> 05:58:10.478 align:start position:0%
being rich enough to have two places to
 
05:58:12.350 --> 05:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
live doesn't give you double the vote
 
05:58:15.548 --> 05:58:15.558 align:start position:0%
power but the point is the people were
 
05:58:18.948 --> 05:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
caught and punished those Bad actors
 
05:58:21.430 --> 05:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
should not be allowed to influence the
 
05:58:24.270 --> 05:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
good people in our legislature to make
 
05:58:27.830 --> 05:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
voting registration a Herculean task for
 
05:58:30.270 --> 05:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
the young the disadvantaged whose
 
05:58:33.070 --> 05:58:33.080 align:start position:0%
documents may be unavailable and others
 
05:58:35.948 --> 05:58:35.958 align:start position:0%
in transitional stages of Life
 
05:58:39.310 --> 05:58:39.320 align:start position:0%
affidavits are legally binding documents
 
05:58:40.990 --> 05:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
and have worked for New Hampshire
 
05:58:44.030 --> 05:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
registrant for years I urge you to
 
05:58:46.110 --> 05:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
oppose HB
 
05:58:50.070 --> 05:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
1569 as a bill in search of a problem a
 
05:58:52.750 --> 05:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
bill that would inadvertently

representative
 
05:59:06.390 --> 05:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
wey if I heard you correctly you
 
05:59:08.270 --> 05:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that some of the citizenship
 
05:59:10.430 --> 05:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
document is something having to prove
 
05:59:12.190 --> 05:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
that is something that you would object
 
05:59:15.670 --> 05:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
to so in the previous Bill we heard
 
05:59:18.628 --> 05:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
testimony about uh Eric and and one of
 
05:59:20.830 --> 05:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
the data items that they require is a
 
05:59:23.310 --> 05:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
proof of citizenship and then uh
 
05:59:24.510 --> 05:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
explanation of what type of
 
05:59:26.230 --> 05:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
documentation was provided for that
 
05:59:27.948 --> 05:59:27.958 align:start position:0%
citizenship in the pendex spe of the
 
05:59:30.830 --> 05:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
bylaws would you be opposed to Eric then
 
05:59:33.310 --> 05:59:33.320 align:start position:0%
if if it's requiring you know that sort
 
05:59:35.468 --> 05:59:35.478 align:start position:0%
of proof of citiz I'm sorry I'm going to
 
05:59:36.548 --> 05:59:36.558 align:start position:0%
do something I've never done I'm going
 
05:59:37.948 --> 05:59:37.958 align:start position:0%
to rule the question out of order it's
 
05:59:40.230 --> 05:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
not it's not gerain to the bill um
 
05:59:42.830 --> 05:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
excellent so don't don't hate me forever
 
05:59:45.190 --> 05:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
but we got to we I'm not opening up
 
05:59:48.110 --> 05:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
Pandora's Box on this further questions

from the
 
05:59:53.390 --> 05:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:58.190 --> 05:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
Lane fine um are are you aware that it
 
06:00:02.070 --> 06:00:02.080 align:start position:0%

06:00:04.270 --> 06:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
$500 to get copies of your
 
06:00:07.868 --> 06:00:07.878 align:start position:0%

personal comment I was a newbury's town
 
06:00:19.910 --> 06:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
moderator for 25 years and the biggest
 
06:00:22.230 --> 06:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
issue people had was
 
06:00:22.240 --> 06:00:24.750 align:start position:0%
issue people had was
citizenship

06:00:24.750 --> 06:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
citizenship
 
06:00:27.510 --> 06:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
documentation fair enough okay uh next
 
06:00:33.708 --> 06:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:38.150 --> 06:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:40.910 --> 06:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hancock hello again I'm Kathy Anderson
 
06:00:44.868 --> 06:00:44.878 align:start position:0%
I'm live in Hancock um I'm
 
06:00:47.628 --> 06:00:47.638 align:start position:0%
speaking as supervisor of checklist for
 
06:00:49.868 --> 06:00:49.878 align:start position:0%
Hancock to speak about how important it
 
06:00:52.548 --> 06:00:52.558 align:start position:0%
is to have these affidavits people come
 
06:00:54.990 --> 06:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
in and many times more people come to
 
06:00:57.548 --> 06:00:57.558 align:start position:0%
register to vote at the election than do
 
06:00:59.430 --> 06:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
in advance of an election and they come
 
06:01:02.628 --> 06:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
in and they don't a small minority do
 
06:01:04.590 --> 06:01:04.600 align:start position:0%
not have all the paperwork and they just
 
06:01:06.830 --> 06:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
don't have it I can think of
 
06:01:10.110 --> 06:01:10.120 align:start position:0%
individuals um who just don't come in
 
06:01:12.230 --> 06:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
with it with one item and having the
 
06:01:14.150 --> 06:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
affidavits makes it work makes people
 
06:01:18.070 --> 06:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
believe in voting makes people feel um a
 
06:01:20.190 --> 06:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
better part of the country and I
 
06:01:22.150 --> 06:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
strongly encourage you to continue
 
06:01:24.110 --> 06:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
having the affidavits and not support
 
06:01:27.270 --> 06:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
this B this issue thank you taking
 
06:01:28.510 --> 06:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
question questions sure are there
 
06:01:30.788 --> 06:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
06:01:34.788 --> 06:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
thank you um next up Bruce
 
06:01:38.270 --> 06:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
Barracks close close ah all right what
 
06:01:41.110 --> 06:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
is it I guess we'll find out in a second
 
06:01:43.590 --> 06:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
no I I may not tell you I'm not sure no
 
06:01:46.468 --> 06:01:46.478 align:start position:0%
it's uh Bruce Burke and I am from the
 
06:01:49.430 --> 06:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
town of Pittsfield um I just thought I'd
 
06:01:53.150 --> 06:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
share a couple figures with you uh in uh
 
06:01:56.510 --> 06:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
terms of perhaps the U Inception of this
 
06:02:00.708 --> 06:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
bill so you heard earlier in the 2020
 
06:02:00.718 --> 06:02:02.750 align:start position:0%
bill so you heard earlier in the 2020
election

06:02:02.750 --> 06:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
election
 
06:02:05.190 --> 06:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
790,000 New Hampshire voters voted I'm
 
06:02:08.390 --> 06:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
going to call it 800,000 for ease let's
 
06:02:11.430 --> 06:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
imagine for a moment that there were
 
06:02:14.948 --> 06:02:14.958 align:start position:0%
8,000 affidavits signed on the day of
 
06:02:17.868 --> 06:02:17.878 align:start position:0%
the election that is
 
06:02:23.030 --> 06:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
1% of the voters in fact it was shared
 
06:02:25.990 --> 06:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
this morning that there were
 
06:02:29.190 --> 06:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
1,400 affid Davids
 
06:02:33.788 --> 06:02:33.798 align:start position:0%
Statewide that comes out to less than
 
06:02:39.070 --> 06:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:43.270 --> 06:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
99.83% of our votes are
 
06:02:46.150 --> 06:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
untainted now let's assume for a moment
 
06:02:48.310 --> 06:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
or let me ask you for a moment do you
 
06:02:52.868 --> 06:02:52.878 align:start position:0%
think all 1,400 affidavits were
 
06:02:55.868 --> 06:02:55.878 align:start position:0%
fraudulent how about half of them being
 
06:03:01.110 --> 06:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:04.750 --> 06:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
99.9% of the vote being uh
 
06:03:04.760 --> 06:03:06.270 align:start position:0%
99.9% of the vote being uh
non-controversial

06:03:06.270 --> 06:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
non-controversial
 
06:03:09.548 --> 06:03:09.558 align:start position:0%
so let's pick another figure 1,400
 
06:03:13.868 --> 06:03:13.878 align:start position:0%
affidavits maybe 10% of them were
 
06:03:16.830 --> 06:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
fraudulent now where are we I can't I
 
06:03:20.030 --> 06:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
don't go past tens of a percent but
 
06:03:22.190 --> 06:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
we're somewhere in hundreds of% of
 
06:03:26.310 --> 06:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
potential fraudulent votes my point is I
 
06:03:28.708 --> 06:03:28.718 align:start position:0%
think you can hear that perhaps this
 
06:03:32.350 --> 06:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
bill right is
 
06:03:35.350 --> 06:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
unnecessary right it is we hear this
 
06:03:38.150 --> 06:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
phrase all the time a a problem right in
 
06:03:40.788 --> 06:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
search of a bill I'd be happy to take
 
06:03:42.510 --> 06:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
your questions I will not do the
 
06:03:46.548 --> 06:03:46.558 align:start position:0%
hundreds of a percent of perhaps
 
06:03:48.150 --> 06:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
fraudulent votes fair enough are there
 
06:03:50.510 --> 06:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee um I have
 
06:03:52.230 --> 06:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
one since I like numbers you like
 
06:03:54.030 --> 06:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
numbers are you aware that the House
 
06:03:56.150 --> 06:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
Majority was decided by less than 100
 
06:04:05.868 --> 06:04:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:08.788 --> 06:04:08.798 align:start position:0%
am the the Assumption then is that the
 
06:04:12.590 --> 06:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
14 you know just to work off of your
 
06:04:15.070 --> 06:04:15.080 align:start position:0%
assumptions and your hypotheticals for a
 
06:04:17.750 --> 06:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
moment sure if there are four 1,400
 
06:04:20.190 --> 06:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
Statewide affidavits and there's some
 
06:04:23.030 --> 06:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
small percentage that are
 
06:04:25.590 --> 06:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
doing is it likely that someone would
 
06:04:27.708 --> 06:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
distribute them across the state evenly
 
06:04:29.868 --> 06:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
or would they focus them on particular
 
06:04:31.430 --> 06:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
Target districts if they wanted to
 
06:04:35.510 --> 06:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
commit fraud sure who knows I mean I I I
 
06:04:37.430 --> 06:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
understand your question I just I'm just
 
06:04:41.270 --> 06:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
going to reiterate that 1,400 affidavits
 
06:04:43.708 --> 06:04:43.718 align:start position:0%
in a voting population of
 
06:04:47.788 --> 06:04:47.798 align:start position:0%
790,000 people is not a significant
 
06:04:50.230 --> 06:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
number and that's assuming for a moment
 
06:04:52.510 --> 06:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
that they're all fraudulent that that's
 
06:04:53.910 --> 06:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
all the point I'm trying to make in
 
06:04:56.390 --> 06:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
terms of this bill well received are
 
06:04:57.510 --> 06:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
there any other questions from the
 
06:05:00.270 --> 06:05:00.280 align:start position:0%

06:05:09.548 --> 06:05:09.558 align:start position:0%
Bernett um if people should could just
 
06:05:11.590 --> 06:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
come and look at this card it is amazing
 
06:05:13.510 --> 06:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
they should all be written like
 
06:05:19.548 --> 06:05:19.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:22.590 --> 06:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
it thank you chairman for that
 
06:05:24.830 --> 06:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
comment good afternoon chairman and
 
06:05:26.430 --> 06:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
06:05:28.708 --> 06:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
ofilia Bernett and I am the Democracy
 
06:05:31.590 --> 06:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
organizer with open democracy and I also
 
06:05:33.548 --> 06:05:33.558 align:start position:0%
advocate for formerly and currently
 
06:05:36.350 --> 06:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
incarcerated individuals I'm here today
 
06:05:38.548 --> 06:05:38.558 align:start position:0%
to testify on HB
 
06:05:42.548 --> 06:05:42.558 align:start position:0%
1569 and urge you to oppose this bill HB
 
06:05:45.230 --> 06:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
1569 is a bill that removes the ability
 
06:05:47.390 --> 06:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
for those registering to vote to sign a
 
06:05:49.190 --> 06:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
sworn affidavit if they don't have
 
06:05:51.590 --> 06:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
physical proof of identity age
 
06:05:55.510 --> 06:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
citizenship or domicile right now law is
 
06:05:58.948 --> 06:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
voters are for proof of domicile age
 
06:06:00.510 --> 06:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
identity and citizenship when
 
06:06:02.990 --> 06:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
registering to vote if they are not able
 
06:06:05.190 --> 06:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
to provide these documents or lack their
 
06:06:07.750 --> 06:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
of they are able to sign an affidavit
 
06:06:09.548 --> 06:06:09.558 align:start position:0%
then they can register and cast their
 
06:06:13.230 --> 06:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
ballot if this bill passes impacted most
 
06:06:15.590 --> 06:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
by this bill are those who may not have
 
06:06:18.310 --> 06:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
all their documents required to register
 
06:06:20.670 --> 06:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
and who are more likely to move and
 
06:06:22.910 --> 06:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
therefore register to vote more
 
06:06:25.190 --> 06:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
frequently like someone who has been
 
06:06:27.590 --> 06:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
previously incarcerated this bill
 
06:06:29.830 --> 06:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
mandating voters to have documents to
 
06:06:32.270 --> 06:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
prove dsah identity and age will

incarcerated individuals this
 
06:06:38.990 --> 06:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
requirement poses a significant barrier
 
06:06:40.830 --> 06:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
to voting for those vulnerable
 
06:06:43.708 --> 06:06:43.718 align:start position:0%
population many of whom face challenges
 
06:06:45.708 --> 06:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
in obtaining these documents due to
 
06:06:48.468 --> 06:06:48.478 align:start position:0%
their past convictions such a bill
 
06:06:50.628 --> 06:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
undermines the principles of a fair and
 
06:06:53.270 --> 06:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
inclusive Democratic process by further

marginalized
 
06:07:00.150 --> 06:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
it is crucial to consider the impact on
 
06:07:02.670 --> 06:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
all members of society including those
 
06:07:04.110 --> 06:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
who have served their time and are
 
06:07:06.670 --> 06:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
seeking to actively participate in Civic
 
06:07:09.110 --> 06:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
engagement formally incarcerated
 
06:07:11.150 --> 06:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
individuals face several challenges in
 
06:07:13.590 --> 06:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
obtaining these documents required for
 
06:07:17.230 --> 06:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
voting including lack of identification
 
06:07:19.510 --> 06:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
many individuals leaving incarceration
 
06:07:21.230 --> 06:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
may not have a valid form of
 
06:07:23.190 --> 06:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
identification such as a driver's
 
06:07:25.750 --> 06:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
license or state ID which is often
 
06:07:28.548 --> 06:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
required to register to vote obtaining
 
06:07:30.468 --> 06:07:30.478 align:start position:0%
documents like birth certificates social
 
06:07:32.670 --> 06:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
security cards or proof of residency can
 
06:07:34.788 --> 06:07:34.798 align:start position:0%
be challenging for those limited for
 
06:07:37.510 --> 06:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
those with limited resources or support
 
06:07:39.990 --> 06:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
networks many firmly incarcerated
 
06:07:42.150 --> 06:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
individuals may lack awareness of the
 
06:07:44.590 --> 06:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
specific documentation requirements for
 
06:07:47.590 --> 06:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
voter registration leading to confusion
 
06:07:49.430 --> 06:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
and potential dis
 
06:07:51.230 --> 06:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
disenfranchisement addressing these
 
06:07:53.310 --> 06:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
challenges is crucial to ensuring that
 
06:07:55.510 --> 06:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
not only just formally incarcerated
 
06:07:58.110 --> 06:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
individuals but also young voters and
 
06:08:00.708 --> 06:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
people experiencing housing insecurity
 
06:08:02.830 --> 06:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
have equal access to their fundamental
 
06:08:05.150 --> 06:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
right to vote and participate in the
 
06:08:08.548 --> 06:08:08.558 align:start position:0%
Democratic process a poll done by new by
 
06:08:12.548 --> 06:08:12.558 align:start position:0%
UNH in 2022 showed that 92% of New
 
06:08:15.430 --> 06:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire voters had had confidence in
 
06:08:18.788 --> 06:08:18.798 align:start position:0%
the 2022 elections Governor sununu
 
06:08:21.310 --> 06:08:21.320 align:start position:0%
himself says our system works and has
 
06:08:24.150 --> 06:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
integrity and Secretary of the State Dan
 
06:08:26.628 --> 06:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
ganin has said there's no evidence that
 
06:08:29.030 --> 06:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
I I've seen of any organized widespread
 
06:08:31.150 --> 06:08:31.160 align:start position:0%
voter fraud taking place in New
 
06:08:33.750 --> 06:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with that being said I ask you
 
06:08:35.990 --> 06:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee to
 
06:08:38.150 --> 06:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill that will disrupt the
 
06:08:40.310 --> 06:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
election process and let's continue to
 
06:08:42.350 --> 06:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
allow Grand estaters to have faith in
 
06:08:45.628 --> 06:08:45.638 align:start position:0%
the system thank you you taking
 
06:08:47.230 --> 06:08:47.240 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes I are
 
06:08:49.110 --> 06:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
06:08:49.120 --> 06:08:52.350 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
representative

06:08:52.350 --> 06:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:52.360 --> 06:08:55.708 align:start position:0%
 
wey

06:09:01.510 --> 06:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
um what is what is the so under RSA
 
06:09:04.750 --> 06:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
6545 um there's a disqualification for
 
06:09:06.310 --> 06:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
felony so a person sentenced for a
 
06:09:08.390 --> 06:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
felony shall forfeit his rights for
 
06:09:10.860 --> 06:09:10.870 align:start position:0%
voting stuff so if
 
06:09:10.870 --> 06:09:14.030 align:start position:0%
voting stuff so if
[Music]

06:09:14.030 --> 06:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:17.190 --> 06:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
you're is there a mechanism that you're
 
06:09:19.788 --> 06:09:19.798 align:start position:0%
propos I'm trying to understand who
 
06:09:22.190 --> 06:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
you're advocating for in terms of are
 
06:09:23.590 --> 06:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
you talking about people who are
 
06:09:25.708 --> 06:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
currently disqualified by their felony
 
06:09:27.948 --> 06:09:27.958 align:start position:0%
convictions are you talking about
 
06:09:30.430 --> 06:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
someone else I I just want to understand
 
06:09:32.910 --> 06:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
that better I I believe if someone has
 
06:09:34.468 --> 06:09:34.478 align:start position:0%
paid their time and has proven
 
06:09:37.910 --> 06:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
themselves to be responsible citizens
 
06:09:39.990 --> 06:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
then I I think there ought to be a
 
06:09:43.430 --> 06:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
process to allow them to vote but um I
 
06:09:47.350 --> 06:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
do um I I just want to understand your
 
06:09:48.990 --> 06:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts on the matter please absolutely
 
06:09:50.990 --> 06:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question um so
 
06:09:53.788 --> 06:09:53.798 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is that you if you are a
 
06:09:55.628 --> 06:09:55.638 align:start position:0%
felon you are able to vote you do have
 
06:09:57.628 --> 06:09:57.638 align:start position:0%
the right to vote but I'm saying being
 
06:09:59.548 --> 06:09:59.558 align:start position:0%
able to come up with these documents is
 
06:10:01.270 --> 06:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
really hard if you first come home from
 
06:10:03.590 --> 06:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
prison or even if it's been a couple
 
06:10:05.390 --> 06:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
months to access some of these documents
 
06:10:08.468 --> 06:10:08.478 align:start position:0%
are really hard because you know you um
 
06:10:10.788 --> 06:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
you no longer live at the apartment or
 
06:10:12.750 --> 06:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
place that you were living at before or
 
06:10:14.070 --> 06:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
you've had to move because you've been
 
06:10:15.708 --> 06:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
incarcerated so you're not there at the
 
06:10:17.030 --> 06:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
place that you were last living at
 
06:10:18.750 --> 06:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
before considering that you've been
 
06:10:21.070 --> 06:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
locked up for a couple years so getting
 
06:10:22.788 --> 06:10:22.798 align:start position:0%
some of these documents might might be
 
06:10:25.030 --> 06:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
hard to obtain to be able to register
 
06:10:27.628 --> 06:10:27.638 align:start position:0%
the vote all right thank you for the
 
06:10:29.110 --> 06:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
answer you're
 
06:10:31.350 --> 06:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
welcome so the member knows in New
 
06:10:34.190 --> 06:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um misdemeanor is up to a year
 
06:10:35.708 --> 06:10:35.718 align:start position:0%
so that's not a felony and then you can
 
06:10:38.190 --> 06:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
be held on preventative detention um and
 
06:10:39.910 --> 06:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
felons get the right to vote after they
 
06:10:41.948 --> 06:10:41.958 align:start position:0%
have been released um their rights are
 
06:10:43.830 --> 06:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
restored so I hope that answers the
 
06:10:45.830 --> 06:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
question so my my answer help the
 
06:10:47.110 --> 06:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
witness out I would assume she would be
 
06:10:49.230 --> 06:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
advocating for um in this particular
 
06:10:50.990 --> 06:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
case those held under a year under mror
 
06:10:52.070 --> 06:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
charge those held under preventive
 
06:10:53.430 --> 06:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
detentions who have not yet lost their
 
06:10:54.270 --> 06:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
right to
 
06:10:57.390 --> 06:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
vote thank you I'm here I'm here for
 
06:10:57.400 --> 06:10:58.990 align:start position:0%
vote thank you I'm here I'm here for
everybody

06:10:58.990 --> 06:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
06:11:02.110 --> 06:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
um further questions from the committee
 
06:11:04.230 --> 06:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
all right hearing none thank you and
 
06:11:06.910 --> 06:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
last up is Henry kimowitz with my
 
06:11:24.670 --> 06:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:27.548 --> 06:11:27.558 align:start position:0%
ACLU thank you yeah my name is Henry
 
06:11:28.948 --> 06:11:28.958 align:start position:0%
Clement toich I'm a senior staff
 
06:11:31.510 --> 06:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
attorney at the ACLU of New Hampshire uh
 
06:11:35.628 --> 06:11:35.638 align:start position:0%
asking the committee to oppose HB
 
06:11:37.708 --> 06:11:37.718 align:start position:0%
1569 there's a couple things that it
 
06:11:40.430 --> 06:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
does uh there's been some discussion of
 
06:11:42.708 --> 06:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
how uh this bill removes all the
 
06:11:44.548 --> 06:11:44.558 align:start position:0%
affidavits used in the registration
 
06:11:47.030 --> 06:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
process which would impact you know
 
06:11:49.830 --> 06:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
hundreds if not thousands of people in a
 
06:11:51.948 --> 06:11:51.958 align:start position:0%
cycle um who don't have proof of
 
06:11:54.110 --> 06:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
citizenship like a passport or a birth
 
06:11:57.110 --> 06:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
certificate um I wanted to address a
 
06:11:58.190 --> 06:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
question that you had asked
 
06:12:00.750 --> 06:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lane about uh court cases
 
06:12:03.030 --> 06:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
striking down documentary proof of
 
06:12:05.190 --> 06:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
citizenship uh representative Lynn is
 
06:12:06.590 --> 06:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
right that most of the cases that
 
06:12:10.110 --> 06:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
address that um come under the nvra but
 
06:12:13.628 --> 06:12:13.638 align:start position:0%
one doesn't and that's F versus swab
 
06:12:16.230 --> 06:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
from the 10th circuit from 2020 which
 
06:12:20.548 --> 06:12:20.558 align:start position:0%
actually uh and the citation is 957 F3
 
06:12:23.310 --> 06:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
1105 and that struck down a documentary
 
06:12:25.150 --> 06:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
proof of citizenship requirement under
 
06:12:26.948 --> 06:12:26.958 align:start position:0%
the 14th Amendment so so that would be
 
06:12:30.910 --> 06:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
applicable here putting aside the um
 
06:12:33.830 --> 06:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
irony of allowing people to challenge
 
06:12:35.548 --> 06:12:35.558 align:start position:0%
voters with an affidavit but not to
 
06:12:38.150 --> 06:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
register to vote with an affidavit one I
 
06:12:40.430 --> 06:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
think underappreciated part of this bill
 
06:12:44.190 --> 06:12:44.200 align:start position:0%
is the um reinvigoration I'll say of
 
06:12:44.200 --> 06:12:45.190 align:start position:0%
is the um reinvigoration I'll say of
voter

06:12:45.190 --> 06:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
voter
 
06:12:48.310 --> 06:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
challenges so under this
 
06:12:51.110 --> 06:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
bill uh if a person challenges an
 
06:12:53.430 --> 06:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
individual's right to vote and the
 
06:12:55.270 --> 06:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
moderator deems that challenge well
 
06:12:57.150 --> 06:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
grounded on a sort of preponderance of
 
06:12:59.670 --> 06:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
the evidence standard the person can't
 
06:13:02.190 --> 06:13:02.200 align:start position:0%
vote and so that's basically what that
 
06:13:05.030 --> 06:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
means is that one person a lay person
 
06:13:07.468 --> 06:13:07.478 align:start position:0%
who doesn't have any training in finding
 
06:13:11.510 --> 06:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
this who isn't a judge um is basically
 
06:13:13.350 --> 06:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
has the right to take your right to vote
 
06:13:16.990 --> 06:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
away from you um and if done wrongly
 
06:13:18.670 --> 06:13:18.680 align:start position:0%
that's an obvious constitutional
 
06:13:21.190 --> 06:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
violation and though there will be
 
06:13:23.190 --> 06:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
mistakes made in that process because
 
06:13:25.510 --> 06:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
there are a number of missing important
 
06:13:28.830 --> 06:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
procedural protection s there's no um
 
06:13:31.150 --> 06:13:31.160 align:start position:0%
rights for Witnesses rights to introduce
 
06:13:34.910 --> 06:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
evidence on your behalf there's no uh
 
06:13:37.190 --> 06:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
judicial right of review there's no
 
06:13:40.350 --> 06:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
right to an attorney there's no um
 
06:13:43.070 --> 06:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
procedural rules there's no right to
 
06:13:47.110 --> 06:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
appeal um the standard of review is
 
06:13:48.708 --> 06:13:48.718 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence which is
 
06:13:50.310 --> 06:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
one of the lowest standards of review
 
06:13:52.510 --> 06:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
that we have and so there's just this
 
06:13:54.868 --> 06:13:54.878 align:start position:0%
tremendous risk that a person can come
 
06:13:57.270 --> 06:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
in submit a written affidavit saying I
 
06:13:59.670 --> 06:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
know Henry he's not a citizen the
 
06:14:01.510 --> 06:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
moderator you know I'm not prepared for
 
06:14:02.468 --> 06:14:02.478 align:start position:0%
this cuz I don't know what's going to
 
06:14:03.948 --> 06:14:03.958 align:start position:0%
happen I didn't bring my passport
 
06:14:05.070 --> 06:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
because I didn't know I was going to be
 
06:14:07.390 --> 06:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
challenged the moderator agrees with the
 
06:14:09.750 --> 06:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
other person now I can't vote and
 
06:14:11.350 --> 06:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
there's nothing I can do about even
 
06:14:14.948 --> 06:14:14.958 align:start position:0%
though in fact I am a CIT citizen so um
 
06:14:16.510 --> 06:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
I think that's a a really good reason to
 
06:14:17.708 --> 06:14:17.718 align:start position:0%
vote against this bill I think it's
 
06:14:20.150 --> 06:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
going to create a lot of liability for
 
06:14:23.468 --> 06:14:23.478 align:start position:0%
people um in addition to the to what
 
06:14:26.110 --> 06:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
others have said about the affidavit so
 
06:14:27.788 --> 06:14:27.798 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to answer any questions if
 
06:14:30.110 --> 06:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
there are
 
06:14:30.120 --> 06:14:32.430 align:start position:0%
there are
any

06:14:32.430 --> 06:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:14:36.830 --> 06:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
Bron for taking my question um thank you
 
06:14:39.468 --> 06:14:39.478 align:start position:0%
for bringing up the voter challenge
 
06:14:43.670 --> 06:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
section of this bill as I read it it
 
06:14:46.390 --> 06:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
says that no challenge may be asserted
 
06:14:49.628 --> 06:14:49.638 align:start position:0%
except in the form of a signed
 
06:14:52.788 --> 06:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
affidavit but what this bill and and
 
06:14:54.350 --> 06:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
please correct me if your understanding
 
06:14:56.750 --> 06:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
is different from mine I am understand
 
06:15:00.270 --> 06:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
this bill to be looking to eliminate
 
06:15:04.190 --> 06:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
affidavits at the polling location for
 
06:15:08.070 --> 06:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
voters but if someone present at the
 
06:15:11.868 --> 06:15:11.878 align:start position:0%
polling location wishes to challenge a
 
06:15:16.390 --> 06:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
voter the only way they can do so is by
 
06:15:21.070 --> 06:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
signing an affidavit does that does that
 
06:15:23.670 --> 06:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this bill make sense
 
06:15:24.948 --> 06:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
with your
 
06:15:27.030 --> 06:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
interpretation I I think it's the right
 
06:15:28.350 --> 06:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the bill I'm not sure
 
06:15:30.990 --> 06:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
it makes sense from a policy perspective
 
06:15:33.750 --> 06:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
um I mean it basically what it's saying
 
06:15:36.030 --> 06:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
is we trust people who are challenging
 
06:15:39.468 --> 06:15:39.478 align:start position:0%
voters more than we trust voters I think
 
06:15:39.478 --> 06:15:41.670 align:start position:0%
voters more than we trust voters I think
thank

06:15:41.670 --> 06:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:15:47.350 --> 06:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:50.628 --> 06:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
Lane and thank you for giving me an
 
06:15:53.350 --> 06:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
answer about the other question
 
06:15:56.350 --> 06:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm kind of harping on the citizens
 
06:16:02.070 --> 06:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
ship piece so um I I is it true that if
 
06:16:06.110 --> 06:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
you lie and say you are a citizen and if
 
06:16:09.350 --> 06:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's found out you can never be a
 
06:16:12.390 --> 06:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
citizen are that you can never be a
 
06:16:14.468 --> 06:16:14.478 align:start position:0%
citizen right so in other words if you
 
06:16:16.070 --> 06:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
lie about
 
06:16:18.830 --> 06:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
that in your background check they'll
 
06:16:20.430 --> 06:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
find that out because you'll be on the
 
06:16:20.440 --> 06:16:21.510 align:start position:0%
find that out because you'll be on the
voter

06:16:21.510 --> 06:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
voter
 
06:16:26.510 --> 06:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
roles and they will use that to deny you
 
06:16:29.628 --> 06:16:29.638 align:start position:0%
citizenship so I I don't I don't know
 
06:16:31.310 --> 06:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
the answer to that because I don't do a
 
06:16:33.708 --> 06:16:33.718 align:start position:0%
lot of okay uh naturalization work but
 
06:16:36.310 --> 06:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you is if you lie on the
 
06:16:37.788 --> 06:16:37.798 align:start position:0%
form and say that you're a citizen and
 
06:16:39.270 --> 06:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
you're not and you're discovered and
 
06:16:41.230 --> 06:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
prosecuted and convicted number one
 
06:16:42.548 --> 06:16:42.558 align:start position:0%
you're convicted of a felony for
 
06:16:44.310 --> 06:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
wrongful voting but number two you're
 
06:16:45.468 --> 06:16:45.478 align:start position:0%
going to lose your right to vote in New
 
06:16:46.590 --> 06:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire forever under the New
 
06:16:48.230 --> 06:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution so even if you
 
06:16:49.948 --> 06:16:49.958 align:start position:0%
then later could naturalize which you're
 
06:16:51.670 --> 06:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
probably right you can't you still would
 
06:16:53.190 --> 06:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
not be able to vote in New
 
06:16:55.270 --> 06:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you could go to prison for
 
06:17:01.590 --> 06:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:05.070 --> 06:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
years sorry it's not pointing my way
 
06:17:07.708 --> 06:17:07.718 align:start position:0%
I thank you Mr chair thanks for taking
 
06:17:10.270 --> 06:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
my question um do you know if it's
 
06:17:14.070 --> 06:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
typical that voters who use an affidavit
 
06:17:17.070 --> 06:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
will have proof of some of these
 
06:17:20.350 --> 06:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
categories but may file an affidavit for
 
06:17:23.468 --> 06:17:23.478 align:start position:0%
citizenship for example so the answer to
 
06:17:25.430 --> 06:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
that I do know the answer to that is yes
 
06:17:28.990 --> 06:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
so in in um
 
06:17:32.430 --> 06:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
2020 November 3rd 2020 we got right to
 
06:17:34.468 --> 06:17:34.478 align:start position:0%
know data from the Secretary of State
 
06:17:38.150 --> 06:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
explaining how many people Ed the
 
06:17:41.030 --> 06:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
um affidavits to prove either Identity
 
06:17:45.708 --> 06:17:45.718 align:start position:0%
or citizenship and um it was in the 600s
 
06:17:48.150 --> 06:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
used the qualified voter affidavit to
 
06:17:51.030 --> 06:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
prove identity in the 800s used it to
 
06:17:53.830 --> 06:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
prove citizenship and 14 people used it
 
06:17:56.030 --> 06:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
to prove identity and citizenship so
 
06:17:59.110 --> 06:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
that means is that everybody but 14
 
06:18:01.468 --> 06:18:01.478 align:start position:0%
people were able to prove one of the
 
06:18:08.190 --> 06:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:12.548 --> 06:18:12.558 align:start position:0%
least thank you thank you I now call
 
06:18:17.670 --> 06:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:24.910 --> 06:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:24.920 --> 06:18:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
one

06:18:29.270 --> 06:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:31.788 --> 06:18:31.798 align:start position:0%
there we go good afternoon uh members of
 
06:18:33.868 --> 06:18:33.878 align:start position:0%
the committee um again my name is
 
06:18:35.270 --> 06:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
Mackenzie St Germain with the New
 
06:18:36.750 --> 06:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire campaign for voting rights and
 
06:18:38.510 --> 06:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
America votes I think my pink card was
 
06:18:40.670 --> 06:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
lost along the way so I apologize if
 
06:18:43.070 --> 06:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
there are two floating around up there
 
06:18:44.510 --> 06:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire campaign for voting
 
06:18:47.390 --> 06:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
rights opposes this legislation um I
 
06:18:49.190 --> 06:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to emphasize that this could
 
06:18:51.430 --> 06:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely affect any person and cost
 
06:18:53.910 --> 06:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
them their right to vote uh we know you
 
06:18:55.430 --> 06:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
know there's some groups that may be
 
06:18:58.070 --> 06:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
more Ed and there's people who
 
06:19:00.150 --> 06:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
anticipate having all of their documents
 
06:19:02.270 --> 06:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
and then on the day of they don't um and
 
06:19:04.270 --> 06:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
for that reason any person could be
 
06:19:05.750 --> 06:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
affected by this bill and absolutely
 
06:19:08.110 --> 06:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
lose their right to cast a vote in an
 
06:19:11.468 --> 06:19:11.478 align:start position:0%
election um I do have a testimony here
 
06:19:13.628 --> 06:19:13.638 align:start position:0%
from Andrew Harmon who's a voter in New
 
06:19:15.868 --> 06:19:15.878 align:start position:0%
Hampton that I will hand out afterwards
 
06:19:18.230 --> 06:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
um he was unable to be here today but he
 
06:19:20.628 --> 06:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
is a legally blind voter um during the
 
06:19:23.750 --> 06:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic he moved from Keen to help his
 
06:19:25.948 --> 06:19:25.958 align:start position:0%
family in New Hampton um that was was
 
06:19:27.750 --> 06:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
his new domicile and he wanted to vote
 
06:19:30.750 --> 06:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
there in the town election I believe in
 
06:19:32.868 --> 06:19:32.878 align:start position:0%
2021 um at that time he had a
 
06:19:34.910 --> 06:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
non-driver's ID but it did not have his
 
06:19:36.548 --> 06:19:36.558 align:start position:0%
new address on it it had his Keen
 
06:19:38.310 --> 06:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
address on it he didn't know that he
 
06:19:40.150 --> 06:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
needed to bring any documents to vote
 
06:19:42.430 --> 06:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
that date other than his ID he brought
 
06:19:44.350 --> 06:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
his ID they asked for CIT proof of
 
06:19:46.948 --> 06:19:46.958 align:start position:0%
citizenship and domicile obiously he did
 
06:19:49.070 --> 06:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
did not have those with him he didn't
 
06:19:50.830 --> 06:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
have a document with his new address on
 
06:19:52.910 --> 06:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
it but he was able to sign an affidavit
 
06:19:55.270 --> 06:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
and cast his vote that same day under
 
06:19:57.310 --> 06:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
this bill he would not be able to cast
 
06:19:58.510 --> 06:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
that vote and he would have been turned
 
06:20:00.788 --> 06:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
away uh I also spoke to another voter
 
06:20:02.590 --> 06:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
recently named Michelle McCord of
 
06:20:04.548 --> 06:20:04.558 align:start position:0%
holderness um she could not be here
 
06:20:07.230 --> 06:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
today but allowed me to share her story
 
06:20:09.110 --> 06:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
um she had moved into a new apartment
 
06:20:10.910 --> 06:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
with her partner just a few weeks before
 
06:20:13.150 --> 06:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
election day again she hadn't signed a
 
06:20:15.910 --> 06:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
lease she was just moving in um with him
 
06:20:17.948 --> 06:20:17.958 align:start position:0%
she had an ID but it had her old address
 
06:20:19.788 --> 06:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
on it she didn't want to vote at her old
 
06:20:21.110 --> 06:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
address she did not feel like that was
 
06:20:22.750 --> 06:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
her home anymore and that was not right
 
06:20:25.430 --> 06:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
to do she wanted to vote at her new home
 
06:20:27.030 --> 06:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
um she didn't have a document with her
 
06:20:29.030 --> 06:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
address on it again she was able to sign
 
06:20:31.708 --> 06:20:31.718 align:start position:0%
an affidavit and vote that way but in
 
06:20:33.548 --> 06:20:33.558 align:start position:0%
both of these cases we would have folks
 
06:20:35.270 --> 06:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
who under this law would be turned away
 
06:20:37.270 --> 06:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
and I think we could probably spend all
 
06:20:39.230 --> 06:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
day here thinking of different options
 
06:20:41.468 --> 06:20:41.478 align:start position:0%
different ways that could happen um I'm
 
06:20:43.468 --> 06:20:43.478 align:start position:0%
someone who normally walks to the polls
 
06:20:46.270 --> 06:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
or I um drive with my fiance if I show
 
06:20:49.468 --> 06:20:49.478 align:start position:0%
up at the polling place and um my name
 
06:20:51.270 --> 06:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
is no longer on the list it was removed
 
06:20:53.788 --> 06:20:53.798 align:start position:0%
somehow as we know some names are
 
06:20:55.990 --> 06:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
wrongfully removed it does happen we
 
06:20:58.150 --> 06:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
have same day registration as a fallback
 
06:21:00.510 --> 06:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
but in that scenario up until this year
 
06:21:02.150 --> 06:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
when I renewed my license it did not
 
06:21:04.190 --> 06:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
have my current address on it without my
 
06:21:05.830 --> 06:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
car registration I would not have
 
06:21:08.948 --> 06:21:08.958 align:start position:0%
something with my address I do not carry
 
06:21:10.628 --> 06:21:10.638 align:start position:0%
around my birth certificate or passport
 
06:21:13.190 --> 06:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know any folks who do um but
 
06:21:15.468 --> 06:21:15.478 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of cases where these
 
06:21:17.230 --> 06:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
documents someone has them they might
 
06:21:19.230 --> 06:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
not have them because of an emergency
 
06:21:20.590 --> 06:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
but we know that they can sign an
 
06:21:22.590 --> 06:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
affidavit that is a legally binding
 
06:21:24.150 --> 06:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
document and folks take those very
 
06:21:26.948 --> 06:21:26.958 align:start position:0%
seriously and it allows all voters all
 
06:21:28.830 --> 06:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
eligible voters to be able to vote and
 
06:21:30.750 --> 06:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
cast their ballot um when they get to
 
06:21:32.510 --> 06:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
the polls under our current system and
 
06:21:34.868 --> 06:21:34.878 align:start position:0%
we need to maintain that system we know
 
06:21:38.310 --> 06:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
that it works and we'll cite one poll uh
 
06:21:41.310 --> 06:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
today's UNH poll showed that 94% of
 
06:21:43.948 --> 06:21:43.958 align:start position:0%
folks uh who are pulled said they were
 
06:21:45.468 --> 06:21:45.478 align:start position:0%
confident that the results in the
 
06:21:47.350 --> 06:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
primary were accurately counted that is
 
06:21:48.788 --> 06:21:48.798 align:start position:0%
a really high percentage of voter
 
06:21:50.270 --> 06:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
confidence and we should do everything
 
06:21:52.390 --> 06:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
to maintain that not to make it more
 
06:21:54.270 --> 06:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to vote in the state so I am
 
06:21:56.350 --> 06:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions
 
06:21:56.360 --> 06:21:57.190 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions
any

06:21:57.190 --> 06:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:22:00.468 --> 06:22:00.478 align:start position:0%
questions good thank you thank
 
06:22:06.670 --> 06:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:23.830 --> 06:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:26.230 --> 06:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
blob thank you
 
06:22:27.990 --> 06:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
my apologies for sending the card up
 
06:22:29.590 --> 06:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
late I didn't realize I didn't send it
 
06:22:31.548 --> 06:22:31.558 align:start position:0%
up before and knowing that there would
 
06:22:34.070 --> 06:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
be a number of U
 
06:22:37.788 --> 06:22:37.798 align:start position:0%
speakers um speaking technically on this
 
06:22:41.510 --> 06:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill my Approach is the philosophical I
 
06:22:43.270 --> 06:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
hope you'll bear with me for less than
 
06:22:43.280 --> 06:22:44.430 align:start position:0%
hope you'll bear with me for less than
two

06:22:44.430 --> 06:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
two
 
06:22:51.070 --> 06:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:54.468 --> 06:22:54.478 align:start position:0%
around I speak in
 
06:22:57.590 --> 06:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
opposition this bill repeals Decades of
 
06:23:01.628 --> 06:23:01.638 align:start position:0%
progress towards rectifying 234 years of
 
06:23:04.150 --> 06:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
denying certain classes of Americans of
 
06:23:07.030 --> 06:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
voice in our experiment in
 
06:23:08.910 --> 06:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
self-governance from the beginning there
 
06:23:10.830 --> 06:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
were restrictions on who could vote and
 
06:23:13.910 --> 06:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
the value of the vote for example Jerry
 
06:23:17.150 --> 06:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
mandering has existed early on in that
 
06:23:19.070 --> 06:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
regard I often think about the Flight of
 
06:23:19.080 --> 06:23:19.868 align:start position:0%
regard I often think about the Flight of
the

06:23:19.868 --> 06:23:19.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:23:22.390 --> 06:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
Kittyhawk and how it only took five
 
06:23:25.030 --> 06:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
minutes for some bright individual to
 
06:23:27.310 --> 06:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
act on the idea of installing a machine
 
06:23:31.230 --> 06:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
gun on it to gain serious advantage over
 
06:23:33.670 --> 06:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
others since the beginning it has been
 
06:23:36.270 --> 06:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
students of good government in and out
 
06:23:38.230 --> 06:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
of government who have delivered
 
06:23:40.868 --> 06:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
expanded rights and
 
06:23:43.110 --> 06:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities artificial intelligence
 
06:23:45.230 --> 06:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
has already been used to recreate music
 
06:23:48.390 --> 06:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
from deceased persons to give adult
 
06:23:52.110 --> 06:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
voice to toddlers to Mock and has been
 
06:23:54.310 --> 06:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
deployed in the grite state to suppress
 
06:23:57.310 --> 06:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
the vote it will be used by independent
 
06:23:59.430 --> 06:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
political organizations competing for
 
06:24:02.670 --> 06:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
the most effective AI ads for their
 
06:24:06.150 --> 06:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
candidates it will be used to subvert
 
06:24:09.190 --> 06:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
democracy it will be used indefinitely
 
06:24:10.910 --> 06:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
for all
 
06:24:14.270 --> 06:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
purposes another serious issue is
 
06:24:17.708 --> 06:24:17.718 align:start position:0%
us we are using the tools of democracy
 
06:24:19.788 --> 06:24:19.798 align:start position:0%
to subvert
 
06:24:22.788 --> 06:24:22.798 align:start position:0%
democracy to start we must unite in this
 
06:24:25.750 --> 06:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
body to maintain confidence in our
 
06:24:28.430 --> 06:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
elections we must continue to expand
 
06:24:31.070 --> 06:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
access to The Ballot Box to make it
 
06:24:34.150 --> 06:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
convenient to vote to hold voting in
 
06:24:36.830 --> 06:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
high esteem against those who would take
 
06:24:41.390 --> 06:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
it from us this bill represents a taking
 
06:24:43.670 --> 06:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
a taking of had fought voting rights
 
06:24:43.680 --> 06:24:45.070 align:start position:0%
a taking of had fought voting rights
already

06:24:45.070 --> 06:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
already
 
06:24:48.788 --> 06:24:48.798 align:start position:0%
acquired in a world of rising autocracy
 
06:24:51.750 --> 06:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
we must rise United in support of
 
06:24:51.760 --> 06:24:53.110 align:start position:0%
we must rise United in support of
expanded

06:24:53.110 --> 06:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
expanded
 
06:24:56.110 --> 06:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
rights I urge itl
 
06:24:56.120 --> 06:25:00.190 align:start position:0%
rights I urge itl
thank

06:25:00.190 --> 06:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:18.670 --> 06:25:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:22.788 --> 06:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh Matt mushan 603 forward
 
06:25:24.510 --> 06:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
um much of what I had prepared today has
 
06:25:26.510 --> 06:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
been said so I'll keep keep it brief um
 
06:25:28.270 --> 06:25:28.280 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify an opposition of
 
06:25:29.548 --> 06:25:29.558 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
06:25:32.510 --> 06:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
1569 um as it's been stated it's really
 
06:25:34.948 --> 06:25:34.958 align:start position:0%
just a bill in search of a problem we
 
06:25:37.390 --> 06:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
have seen numerous studies reports and
 
06:25:39.590 --> 06:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
investigations that have all confirmed
 
06:25:41.350 --> 06:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire elections are safe
 
06:25:43.310 --> 06:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
and secure and that our existing
 
06:25:46.270 --> 06:25:46.280 align:start position:0%
affidavit system works 603 forward
 
06:25:48.468 --> 06:25:48.478 align:start position:0%
opposes this legislation because it will
 
06:25:50.990 --> 06:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
disproportionately negatively impact the
 
06:25:53.110 --> 06:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
right to vote for young
 
06:25:56.070 --> 06:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
voters as well as I'm trying to
 
06:25:58.468 --> 06:25:58.478 align:start position:0%
summarize here as well as new Americans
 
06:26:00.390 --> 06:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
people experiencing housing insecurity
 
06:26:01.788 --> 06:26:01.798 align:start position:0%
and the
 
06:26:06.110 --> 06:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
elderly um if we wanted to uh if we
 
06:26:07.948 --> 06:26:07.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to prioritize making our
 
06:26:09.510 --> 06:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
elections more secure there are other
 
06:26:11.788 --> 06:26:11.798 align:start position:0%
options like House Bill 1557 thank you
 
06:26:11.798 --> 06:26:13.628 align:start position:0%
options like House Bill 1557 thank you
very

06:26:13.628 --> 06:26:13.638 align:start position:0%
very
 
06:26:16.150 --> 06:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
much thank you any
 
06:26:19.190 --> 06:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
questions good thank you very
 
06:26:24.190 --> 06:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:24.200 --> 06:26:30.670 align:start position:0%
 
Spencer

06:26:30.670 --> 06:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:34.628 --> 06:26:34.638 align:start position:0%
hi uh thank you very much um Mr chairman
 
06:26:36.230 --> 06:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
and the committee for taking my
 
06:26:39.030 --> 06:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
testimony today it's actually a bit in
 
06:26:43.270 --> 06:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
two parts um I am with the Kent Street
 
06:26:45.628 --> 06:26:45.638 align:start position:0%
Coalition we're an all volunteer
 
06:26:48.350 --> 06:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
Grassroots organiza advocacy
 
06:26:51.468 --> 06:26:51.478 align:start position:0%
organization and we strongly oppose this
 
06:26:55.150 --> 06:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
bill and urge itl so I want to go on the
 
06:26:59.590 --> 06:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
record with that um I am you know
 
06:27:03.350 --> 06:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
surprised myself by some of the numbers
 
06:27:06.030 --> 06:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of how many people each year
 
06:27:09.270 --> 06:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
are displaced from their homes by
 
06:27:12.190 --> 06:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
natural disasters and fires and other
 
06:27:15.670 --> 06:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
events um overall across the US it's 3.3
 
06:27:20.070 --> 06:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
million people that's 1.3% of the adult
 
06:27:22.468 --> 06:27:22.478 align:start position:0%
population unless we think it doesn't
 
06:27:25.750 --> 06:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
happen here in New Hampshire in 20 22
 
06:27:29.310 --> 06:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
according to the Census Bureau
 
06:27:32.030 --> 06:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
16,26 people were displaced from their
 
06:27:35.190 --> 06:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
homes that's not a small number it's not
 
06:27:38.390 --> 06:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
an uncommon event unfortunately it's
 
06:27:40.510 --> 06:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
hard for us to imagine unless it's
 
06:27:42.830 --> 06:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
happened to us that it could in fact
 
06:27:47.070 --> 06:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
happen to us we know recently in sunpi
 
06:27:50.430 --> 06:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
you know 20 to 25 people lost their home
 
06:27:53.590 --> 06:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
like that when their building went up um
 
06:27:57.628 --> 06:27:57.638 align:start position:0%
in Flames for fortunately nobody was um
 
06:28:00.310 --> 06:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
killed in that particular
 
06:28:04.150 --> 06:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
circumstance I know that um even
 
06:28:06.788 --> 06:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
something just much simpler I was in a
 
06:28:10.150 --> 06:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
car accident where my car was totaled I
 
06:28:13.310 --> 06:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
was lucky to to be unharmed but my car
 
06:28:15.708 --> 06:28:15.718 align:start position:0%
was towed away with all my my things in
 
06:28:19.468 --> 06:28:19.478 align:start position:0%
it including my purse and my ID and um
 
06:28:24.070 --> 06:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
so I temporarily lost access to that um
 
06:28:26.390 --> 06:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
so I think all so when we think about
 
06:28:28.910 --> 06:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
you know the are we do have some close
 
06:28:31.350 --> 06:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
elections in New Hampshire there's no
 
06:28:35.628 --> 06:28:35.638 align:start position:0%
question but we have to weigh the people
 
06:28:38.708 --> 06:28:38.718 align:start position:0%
that might and it seems to be an
 
06:28:41.590 --> 06:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
exceedingly no low number of people that
 
06:28:44.590 --> 06:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
might abuse the system and whose votes
 
06:28:48.190 --> 06:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
might get counted against those who
 
06:28:51.390 --> 06:28:51.400 align:start position:0%
might have an incident or some situation
 
06:28:54.548 --> 06:28:54.558 align:start position:0%
in their life where they can't produce
 
06:28:56.548 --> 06:28:56.558 align:start position:0%
documents ments and just think what that
 
06:28:59.030 --> 06:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
would look like if the
 
06:29:01.948 --> 06:29:01.958 align:start position:0%
16,26 people displaced from their
 
06:29:04.910 --> 06:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
homes we're not able to cast their votes
 
06:29:08.750 --> 06:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
how would that affect our elections here
 
06:29:11.468 --> 06:29:11.478 align:start position:0%
so I said my my testimony was in two
 
06:29:14.310 --> 06:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
parts and I wanted to kind of deal with
 
06:29:17.708 --> 06:29:17.718 align:start position:0%
Statistics and um the general kind of
 
06:29:20.070 --> 06:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
first because the other thing I wanted
 
06:29:24.070 --> 06:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
to do is to read uh some testimony from
 
06:29:25.708 --> 06:29:25.718 align:start position:0%
someone who's a close close friend she's
 
06:29:27.390 --> 06:29:27.400 align:start position:0%
not a member of Ken street but a very
 
06:29:29.910 --> 06:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
close friend of one of our members and
 
06:29:33.948 --> 06:29:33.958 align:start position:0%
her name is Susan Young's uh her
 
06:29:37.670 --> 06:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
situation are you raising your
 
06:29:37.680 --> 06:29:39.670 align:start position:0%
situation are you raising your
hand

06:29:39.670 --> 06:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
hand
 
06:29:44.350 --> 06:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
okay okay um her situation is one that
 
06:29:47.150 --> 06:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately has a very tragic um
 
06:29:50.030 --> 06:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
Dimension to it um so I'll just state
 
06:29:52.230 --> 06:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
that ahead of of reading her
 
06:29:55.788 --> 06:29:55.798 align:start position:0%
testimony um so again Susan Young's
 
06:29:57.868 --> 06:29:57.878 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to use her voice because
 
06:29:58.990 --> 06:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
this is her
 
06:30:01.628 --> 06:30:01.638 align:start position:0%
testimony I am writing to express my
 
06:30:04.708 --> 06:30:04.718 align:start position:0%
strong opposition to House Bill
 
06:30:08.070 --> 06:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
1569 a act relative to eliminating voter
 
06:30:10.670 --> 06:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
identification exceptions this bill
 
06:30:13.628 --> 06:30:13.638 align:start position:0%
would unfairly disenfranchise legitimate
 
06:30:15.948 --> 06:30:15.958 align:start position:0%
voters the legislature should be
 
06:30:18.830 --> 06:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
encouraging voting not trying to limit
 
06:30:22.750 --> 06:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
it my opposition is based on personal
 
06:30:26.590 --> 06:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
experience on the 22nd of January
 
06:30:30.628 --> 06:30:30.638 align:start position:0%
2017 my 1770s Colonial House in Webster
 
06:30:34.070 --> 06:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was destroyed by fire
 
06:30:37.430 --> 06:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
taking the life of my husband Dr Steven
 
06:30:40.430 --> 06:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
Young's and destroying virtually all of
 
06:30:43.750 --> 06:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
my possessions I lost my car my
 
06:30:46.350 --> 06:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
husband's truck my passport my driver's
 
06:30:48.430 --> 06:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
license my birth certificate all my
 
06:30:52.230 --> 06:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
clothes and everything else it took me a
 
06:30:54.150 --> 06:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
while to get a new birth certificate
 
06:30:58.110 --> 06:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
from my birth place in Dora Iowa a new
 
06:31:00.350 --> 06:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
driver's license and even longer for a
 
06:31:00.360 --> 06:31:01.310 align:start position:0%
driver's license and even longer for a
new

06:31:01.310 --> 06:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
new
 
06:31:03.750 --> 06:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
passport if this event had happened
 
06:31:06.590 --> 06:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
right before an election I would
 
06:31:08.430 --> 06:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
probably still would have been able to
 
06:31:11.910 --> 06:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
vote in Webster filling out an affidavit
 
06:31:14.270 --> 06:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
and relying on the the town clerk or
 
06:31:17.030 --> 06:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
moderator to verify that I am who I
 
06:31:19.910 --> 06:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
State I am Webster is a small enough
 
06:31:21.430 --> 06:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
town that both the clerk and the
 
06:31:24.150 --> 06:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
moderator would have known who I was
 
06:31:26.270 --> 06:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
however if I had lived in a larger Town
 
06:31:28.310 --> 06:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
it was it would be very unlikely that
 
06:31:30.910 --> 06:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
those people would know me personally if
 
06:31:33.750 --> 06:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
this new law had been in effect I would
 
06:31:35.190 --> 06:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
not have been allowed to fill out an
 
06:31:36.948 --> 06:31:36.958 align:start position:0%
affidavit and I would not have been
 
06:31:39.548 --> 06:31:39.558 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote taking away my
 
06:31:42.708 --> 06:31:42.718 align:start position:0%
constitutional right there are many
 
06:31:44.788 --> 06:31:44.798 align:start position:0%
legitimate reasons why someone would be
 
06:31:48.510 --> 06:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
without proper ID at a specific time I
 
06:31:50.708 --> 06:31:50.718 align:start position:0%
think this change is a solution in
 
06:31:53.430 --> 06:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
search of a problem elections in New
 
06:31:56.510 --> 06:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are safe secure and virtually
 
06:32:00.150 --> 06:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
fraud-free I strongly oppose House Bill
 
06:32:03.670 --> 06:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
1569 and again that's from Susan young
 
06:32:06.030 --> 06:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
so that completes my testimony okay will
 
06:32:06.910 --> 06:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
you be taking questions from the
 
06:32:09.948 --> 06:32:09.958 align:start position:0%
committee sure all right seeing none uh
 
06:32:23.628 --> 06:32:23.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:23.638 --> 06:32:28.430 align:start position:0%
 
tramble

06:32:28.430 --> 06:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:29.868 --> 06:32:29.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and committee
 
06:32:31.830 --> 06:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
members my name is David Trumble I'm
 
06:32:34.070 --> 06:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
from the town ofwar and I oppose this
 
06:32:36.830 --> 06:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
bill for three reasons first voting it's
 
06:32:39.670 --> 06:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
a fundamental right it's how we choose
 
06:32:42.388 --> 06:32:42.398 align:start position:0%
our legislators it's the Bedrock of our
 
06:32:45.510 --> 06:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
democracy any attempt to restrict voting
 
06:32:46.868 --> 06:32:46.878 align:start position:0%
rights should be looked at very
 
06:32:49.110 --> 06:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
carefully because you must weigh the
 
06:32:51.030 --> 06:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
impact of someone losing that right to
 
06:32:53.548 --> 06:32:53.558 align:start position:0%
vote second I will give you some numbers
 
06:32:55.708 --> 06:32:55.718 align:start position:0%
on those affidavit and how many were
 
06:32:57.110 --> 06:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
returned this is from the New Hampshire
 
06:33:00.468 --> 06:33:00.478 align:start position:0%
Business Review November 7th of 21 and
 
06:33:02.788 --> 06:33:02.798 align:start position:0%
it's talking about the 2020 election in
 
06:33:05.190 --> 06:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
It quotes from rep Bill Gardner our
 
06:33:07.868 --> 06:33:07.878 align:start position:0%
former Secretary of State he said that
 
06:33:10.590 --> 06:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
about 4,000 voters had to sign such an
 
06:33:12.468 --> 06:33:12.478 align:start position:0%
affidavit in the state's primary and
 
06:33:15.070 --> 06:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
general elections in 2020 of those the
 
06:33:17.030 --> 06:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
state had not been able to authenticate
 
06:33:21.070 --> 06:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
600 so 30400 people filled out an
 
06:33:23.948 --> 06:33:23.958 align:start position:0%
affidavit went through the process came
 
06:33:25.750 --> 06:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
back fill sold out the necessary papers
 
06:33:27.948 --> 06:33:27.958 align:start position:0%
and their votes counted that's
 
06:33:31.868 --> 06:33:31.878 align:start position:0%
3,400 people in one single election year
 
06:33:33.868 --> 06:33:33.878 align:start position:0%
so your question comes up well how much
 
06:33:36.430 --> 06:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
fraud is there representative Brennan
 
06:33:39.070 --> 06:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
asked representative Lynn specifically
 
06:33:41.430 --> 06:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
how much fraud is there when people were
 
06:33:44.310 --> 06:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
trying to use a fake voter ID and he
 
06:33:46.788 --> 06:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
could not answer that question but I can
 
06:33:48.510 --> 06:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
give you some data on that the Brennan
 
06:33:50.670 --> 06:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
Center for justice in their report
 
06:33:53.468 --> 06:33:53.478 align:start position:0%
debunking the voter fraud myth has about
 
06:33:55.788 --> 06:33:55.798 align:start position:0%
a dozen studies court cases on it I'll
 
06:33:58.430 --> 06:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
just read you one a comprehensive study
 
06:34:01.190 --> 06:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
found 31 credible instances of
 
06:34:04.670 --> 06:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
impersonation fraud from 2000 to 2014
 
06:34:08.590 --> 06:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
out of more than 1 billion ballots cast
 
06:34:11.270 --> 06:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
even this tiny number is likely inflated
 
06:34:13.070 --> 06:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
as the study's author counted not just
 
06:34:15.030 --> 06:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
prosecutions or convictions but any and
 
06:34:16.868 --> 06:34:16.878 align:start position:0%
all credible claims and that answers
 
06:34:18.590 --> 06:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn's other response
 
06:34:21.150 --> 06:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
which it's as a hard crime to prosecute
 
06:34:22.948 --> 06:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
and similar numbers come about in the
 
06:34:25.070 --> 06:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
fifth Circuit Court of in Texas where
 
06:34:26.910 --> 06:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
they found that the photo ID law was
 
06:34:28.830 --> 06:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
racially discriminatory so what does
 
06:34:29.990 --> 06:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
that mean for New
 
06:34:33.388 --> 06:34:33.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 31 out of a billion votes is
 
06:34:37.070 --> 06:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
one out of 30 million it will take us 80
 
06:34:40.868 --> 06:34:40.878 align:start position:0%
years before we get 30 million votes so
 
06:34:43.708 --> 06:34:43.718 align:start position:0%
this bill would stop one case of voter
 
06:34:46.110 --> 06:34:46.120 align:start position:0%
fraud in the next 80 years but it's
 
06:34:48.788 --> 06:34:48.798 align:start position:0%
going to disenfranchise 3,400 New
 
06:34:51.468 --> 06:34:51.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people every single election
 
06:34:53.868 --> 06:34:53.878 align:start position:0%
you multiply that o out over those years
 
06:34:56.110 --> 06:34:56.120 align:start position:0%
that's 100 50,000 people in this state
 
06:34:58.270 --> 06:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
lose their vote because maybe they
 
06:35:00.510 --> 06:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
forgot their wallet on the day they came
 
06:35:02.670 --> 06:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
to vote they work at a job they can only
 
06:35:04.548 --> 06:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
vote at the last 15 minutes when they go
 
06:35:06.910 --> 06:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
to show up to vote this bill would keep
 
06:35:08.190 --> 06:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
them out if they want to register and
 
06:35:10.150 --> 06:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
vote on the same day these are honest
 
06:35:12.150 --> 06:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
law-abiding hardworking people who have
 
06:35:14.270 --> 06:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
a legitimate reason to not be carrying
 
06:35:16.750 --> 06:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
around all their documents we would lose
 
06:35:19.990 --> 06:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
150,000 votes to stop one case of voter
 
06:35:22.110 --> 06:35:22.120 align:start position:0%
fraud in the next 80 years I don't think
 
06:35:23.350 --> 06:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
that really serves the people of New
 
06:35:24.948 --> 06:35:24.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire very well lastly
 
06:35:26.788 --> 06:35:26.798 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn said well if 600
 
06:35:28.430 --> 06:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
people didn't come forward that's
 
06:35:30.750 --> 06:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
suspicious maybe the election results
 
06:35:33.310 --> 06:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
came out and the election was clearly
 
06:35:34.708 --> 06:35:34.718 align:start position:0%
decided one way or the other and they
 
06:35:36.708 --> 06:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
said I'm just not going to bother going
 
06:35:38.990 --> 06:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
to do all that extra work because it
 
06:35:40.468 --> 06:35:40.478 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have made a difference anyway
 
06:35:42.628 --> 06:35:42.638 align:start position:0%
if if the decision in my town was
 
06:35:45.350 --> 06:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
decided by 700 votes it's not suspicious
 
06:35:47.030 --> 06:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
at all these are people who deserve the
 
06:35:48.510 --> 06:35:48.520 align:start position:0%

public hearing on Hospital 1569 um let's
 
06:36:56.110 --> 06:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
stand in recess for 10 minutes and get
 
06:36:57.468 --> 06:36:57.478 align:start position:0%
our people back together how do that
 
06:37:00.830 --> 06:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
work for you yeah th um little thinned
 
06:37:04.468 --> 06:37:04.478 align:start position:0%
out yeah so we'll uh let me kind of tell
 
06:37:06.190 --> 06:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
the committee like where my head's at
 
06:37:07.310 --> 06:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
we're obviously running really behind
 
06:37:08.628 --> 06:37:08.638 align:start position:0%
schedule so there's going to be no work
 
06:37:11.868 --> 06:37:11.878 align:start position:0%
session this afternoon because no
 
06:37:15.190 --> 06:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
um and uh yeah I I don't hear any
 
06:37:17.708 --> 06:37:17.718 align:start position:0%
objections to that so the other thing is
 
06:37:19.110 --> 06:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
is the staff we're getting towards the
 
06:37:21.468 --> 06:37:21.478 align:start position:0%
end of the staff hours so when we get to
 
06:37:22.708 --> 06:37:22.718 align:start position:0%
exec we're not going to have the ability
 
06:37:24.868 --> 06:37:24.878 align:start position:0%
to send anything to OS for amendments so
 
06:37:26.230 --> 06:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
if we find something during exec we're
 
06:37:27.868 --> 06:37:27.878 align:start position:0%
just not going to burden our good people
 
06:37:29.750 --> 06:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
at OS we'll take care of them next week
 
06:37:31.030 --> 06:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
so if we find something that needs an
 
06:37:32.990 --> 06:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
amendment during exec we'll recess come
 
06:37:35.230 --> 06:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
back next week sign say next week what's
 
06:37:39.388 --> 06:37:39.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:43.388 --> 06:37:43.398 align:start position:0%
um okay yeah we'll figure it out
 
06:37:45.788 --> 06:37:45.798 align:start position:0%
um no no no it's fine it's fine we'll
 
06:37:47.590 --> 06:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
take care of it um but anyways it the
 
06:37:50.070 --> 06:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
the whole the the point Remains the Same
 
06:37:53.110 --> 06:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
um we're not going to ask for amendments
 
06:37:55.948 --> 06:37:55.958 align:start position:0%
at this time so let's take let's take 15
 
06:37:57.510 --> 06:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
minutes get everybody together and we'll
 
06:37:59.468 --> 06:37:59.478 align:start position:0%

say 4 350 350 return 350 okay all right
 
06:38:06.468 --> 06:38:06.478 align:start position:0%

06:38:08.190 --> 06:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
respective groups caucus to make sure
 
06:38:23.110 --> 06:38:23.120 align:start position:0%

had two bills that went very long um so
 
06:59:48.150 --> 06:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do today is we're
 
06:59:49.430 --> 06:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
going to try to get through as much work

long if there's actual genuine debate
 
07:00:05.350 --> 07:00:05.360 align:start position:0%

questions I'm happy to answer them um
 
07:09:07.708 --> 07:09:07.718 align:start position:0%
the I basically took what I heard during
 
07:09:09.750 --> 07:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
the hearings as
 
07:09:12.948 --> 07:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
concerns um and addressed them so the
 
07:09:15.430 --> 07:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
first concern was um the secretary
 
07:09:17.030 --> 07:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
States wanted to make sure that it was
 
07:09:20.510 --> 07:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh ballots um the ballots cast not
 
07:09:22.430 --> 07:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
ballots uh
 
07:09:25.310 --> 07:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh the not ballots I I can't remember
 
07:09:26.548 --> 07:09:26.558 align:start position:0%
what I said before but it was inaccurate
 
07:09:27.388 --> 07:09:27.398 align:start position:0%
it was like
 
07:09:29.350 --> 07:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
requested um the type of the election
 
07:09:31.230 --> 07:09:31.240 align:start position:0%
the appity ballot was was oh there's a
 
07:09:33.350 --> 07:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
typo in here all right well never mind
 
07:09:34.270 --> 07:09:34.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to recess the hearing
 
07:09:37.830 --> 07:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
because there's a typo um was cast they
 
07:09:39.030 --> 07:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
missed a
 
07:09:41.190 --> 07:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh they missed a which all right so
 
07:09:42.628 --> 07:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
anyways all right well never mind
 
07:09:44.548 --> 07:09:44.558 align:start position:0%
there's a typo in the amendment so with
 
07:09:47.350 --> 07:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to recess
 
07:09:50.670 --> 07:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
1192 um let me go back to this 1126
 
07:09:51.750 --> 07:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
07:09:53.230 --> 07:09:53.240 align:start position:0%
so we're going to re I'm going to recess
 
07:09:55.310 --> 07:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
that and we'll try again but anyways if
 
07:09:56.868 --> 07:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
you look at the amendment uh you can
 
07:09:58.110 --> 07:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
take a look at what I'm trying to do and
 
07:09:59.510 --> 07:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
then I'll fix the typos and come back
 
07:10:01.670 --> 07:10:01.680 align:start position:0%

07:10:17.788 --> 07:10:17.798 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 1099 uh relative
 
07:10:19.788 --> 07:10:19.798 align:start position:0%
to partisan School District
 
07:10:22.750 --> 07:10:22.760 align:start position:0%

bill yes just quickly I'm I'm in the
 
07:10:41.150 --> 07:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
past I've done similar bills I think
 
07:10:43.548 --> 07:10:43.558 align:start position:0%
School District laws should be the same
 
07:10:46.670 --> 07:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
as Town laws and whether or not anybody
 
07:10:49.430 --> 07:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
does this or not it's to make it
 
07:10:52.388 --> 07:10:52.398 align:start position:0%
consistent so some town wants to do it
 
07:10:55.030 --> 07:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
let the school district also follow you
 
07:10:57.990 --> 07:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
know for making it bipartisan and you
 
07:11:00.548 --> 07:11:00.558 align:start position:0%
know City elections are already partisan
 
07:11:02.510 --> 07:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
I mean even though they're not
 
07:11:05.628 --> 07:11:05.638 align:start position:0%
designated at such but just just to make
 
07:11:09.868 --> 07:11:09.878 align:start position:0%
the law consistent with town thank you
 
07:11:12.510 --> 07:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill um
 
07:11:13.750 --> 07:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
believe representative Brennan had her
 
07:11:16.350 --> 07:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
hand up so I try to alternate so thank
 
07:11:21.350 --> 07:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
you um I wonder if those in favor of
 
07:11:25.548 --> 07:11:25.558 align:start position:0%
this bill uh have any concerns about the
 
07:11:31.430 --> 07:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
method by which um you would go about in
 
07:11:33.670 --> 07:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
engaging in a partisan School Board
 
07:11:35.590 --> 07:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
election if I remember correctly and I
 
07:11:36.670 --> 07:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
don't have the bill in front of me I
 
07:11:38.310 --> 07:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
have not flip to that page yet because
 
07:11:41.590 --> 07:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit surprised um by the
 
07:11:44.110 --> 07:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motion
 
07:11:48.350 --> 07:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
um if I remember correctly this is a
 
07:11:51.830 --> 07:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
caucus process that would have to
 
07:11:57.708 --> 07:11:57.718 align:start position:0%
happen um prior to the
 
07:12:01.788 --> 07:12:01.798 align:start position:0%
election it would involve multiple
 
07:12:05.190 --> 07:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
stages um and really complicate the
 
07:12:05.200 --> 07:12:06.430 align:start position:0%
stages um and really complicate the
process

07:12:06.430 --> 07:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
process
 
07:12:06.440 --> 07:12:07.990 align:start position:0%
process
for

07:12:07.990 --> 07:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:12:10.910 --> 07:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
voters in a
 
07:12:10.920 --> 07:12:12.628 align:start position:0%
voters in a
town

07:12:12.628 --> 07:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
town
 
07:12:16.070 --> 07:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
additionally um Municipal elections are
 
07:12:16.080 --> 07:12:17.388 align:start position:0%
additionally um Municipal elections are
generally

07:12:17.388 --> 07:12:17.398 align:start position:0%
generally
 
07:12:20.030 --> 07:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan in
 
07:12:24.310 --> 07:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
most they are nonpartisan they do not
 
07:12:28.590 --> 07:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
show what party registration a candidate
 
07:12:32.388 --> 07:12:32.398 align:start position:0%
is and that is by Design to make sure
 
07:12:35.110 --> 07:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
that you have Community
 
07:12:38.350 --> 07:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
representation for
 
07:12:42.548 --> 07:12:42.558 align:start position:0%
everyone in doing so for a school board
 
07:12:45.788 --> 07:12:45.798 align:start position:0%
making that partisan you contributing
 
07:12:49.948 --> 07:12:49.958 align:start position:0%
potentially to increased division in a
 
07:12:49.958 --> 07:12:51.510 align:start position:0%
potentially to increased division in a
community

07:12:51.510 --> 07:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
community
 
07:12:53.830 --> 07:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
also during testimony I asked the
 
07:12:56.468 --> 07:12:56.478 align:start position:0%
question if we would then be if the next
 
07:12:59.270 --> 07:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
step would be requiring uh student
 
07:13:02.110 --> 07:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
registrations to show party affiliation
 
07:13:03.788 --> 07:13:03.798 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there was balanced
 
07:13:06.150 --> 07:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
representation on the school board for
 
07:13:11.030 --> 07:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
the students because the school board is
 
07:13:14.750 --> 07:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
there for the students to serve the
 
07:13:17.510 --> 07:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
students and so I'm very concerned about
 
07:13:20.230 --> 07:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
this and and I wonder if you share any
 
07:13:21.590 --> 07:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
of my concerns
 
07:13:25.270 --> 07:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
concerns further questions on the bill
 
07:13:28.110 --> 07:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
um represent yeah just to follow up on
 
07:13:30.788 --> 07:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
that it's it's only if the candidate
 
07:13:34.510 --> 07:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
wants to the candidate even if they
 
07:13:36.388 --> 07:13:36.398 align:start position:0%
don't make it through the caucus they
 
07:13:40.670 --> 07:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
can still register as an independent so
 
07:13:43.868 --> 07:13:43.878 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really change anything
 
07:13:45.468 --> 07:13:45.478 align:start position:0%
candidates don't have to and like we
 
07:13:48.548 --> 07:13:48.558 align:start position:0%
heard in the past and the town ones no
 
07:13:51.708 --> 07:13:51.718 align:start position:0%
town has done it since 79 so my thing is
 
07:13:55.110 --> 07:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
just let's make the law
 
07:13:57.110 --> 07:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
consistent of hammer you
 
07:14:00.548 --> 07:14:00.558 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you you know I think
 
07:14:02.310 --> 07:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
this should be left to the cities and
 
07:14:06.150 --> 07:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
towns to decide for instance Manchester
 
07:14:08.230 --> 07:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
City Charter has a provision for all
 
07:14:11.590 --> 07:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
School Board elections to be nonpartisan
 
07:14:13.548 --> 07:14:13.558 align:start position:0%
and this would require a charter
 
07:14:15.110 --> 07:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment wouldn't
 
07:14:17.788 --> 07:14:17.798 align:start position:0%
it enabling it's enabling it's not
 
07:14:19.590 --> 07:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
requiring enabling it's enabling it's
 
07:14:22.548 --> 07:14:22.558 align:start position:0%
very similar to um I mean it's identical
 
07:14:25.948 --> 07:14:25.958 align:start position:0%
to uh town city or town elections which
 
07:14:27.830 --> 07:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
allow for partisan Manchester actually
 
07:14:30.270 --> 07:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
used to have a partisan ballot one fact
 
07:14:32.708 --> 07:14:32.718 align:start position:0%
um I'll app Pine on this one real fast
 
07:14:34.548 --> 07:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote in favor of this um
 
07:14:36.430 --> 07:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
because it's going I actually think it
 
07:14:38.910 --> 07:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
will do the thing that nobody really
 
07:14:41.190 --> 07:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
wants to say out loud which is increase
 
07:14:43.590 --> 07:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
turnout in the town elections most of
 
07:14:45.670 --> 07:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
the voters do not know who the
 
07:14:47.350 --> 07:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
candidates are that's why we have a
 
07:14:50.030 --> 07:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
party preference on a ballot is to give
 
07:14:54.150 --> 07:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
voters a framework of this candidate
 
07:14:57.270 --> 07:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
generally agrees with this set of ideals
 
07:14:59.628 --> 07:14:59.638 align:start position:0%
um and that is how we have to understand
 
07:15:01.708 --> 07:15:01.718 align:start position:0%
the reality is that's probably how 80 to
 
07:15:03.388 --> 07:15:03.398 align:start position:0%
85% of Voters in the state make their
 
07:15:05.708 --> 07:15:05.718 align:start position:0%
decision and while we may not all love
 
07:15:09.230 --> 07:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
that um that is just a fact the town and
 
07:15:11.948 --> 07:15:11.958 align:start position:0%
City elections are honestly 15% turnouts
 
07:15:14.868 --> 07:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
kind of embarrassing um they're not I I
 
07:15:16.230 --> 07:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
I love it when they we hear the
 
07:15:17.388 --> 07:15:17.398 align:start position:0%
arguments of oh the school board
 
07:15:18.910 --> 07:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
represents the town no the school board
 
07:15:23.270 --> 07:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
represents 50 50% % of 15% so the school
 
07:15:25.868 --> 07:15:25.878 align:start position:0%
board represents like 7.5% of the voters
 
07:15:29.230 --> 07:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
at best um it's actually a very very
 
07:15:31.230 --> 07:15:31.240 align:start position:0%
tiny minority because the turnout's so
 
07:15:33.590 --> 07:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
low so anything that we can do that
 
07:15:35.430 --> 07:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
increases turnout in these elections
 
07:15:38.830 --> 07:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
will actually get a more representative
 
07:15:41.788 --> 07:15:41.798 align:start position:0%
body on the board um and by giving
 
07:15:41.798 --> 07:15:43.190 align:start position:0%
body on the board um and by giving
voters

07:15:43.190 --> 07:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
voters
 
07:15:45.548 --> 07:15:45.558 align:start position:0%
a an option if the if the town and the
 
07:15:46.548 --> 07:15:46.558 align:start position:0%
school board wants to do it they don't
 
07:15:48.110 --> 07:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
even have to do it but if they want to
 
07:15:50.270 --> 07:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
do it then they can enact this option
 
07:15:52.388 --> 07:15:52.398 align:start position:0%
and they might my guess is if the
 
07:15:54.510 --> 07:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
ballots became partisan openly I should
 
07:15:55.948 --> 07:15:55.958 align:start position:0%
say openly partisan because in
 
07:15:58.788 --> 07:15:58.798 align:start position:0%
Manchester we have nonpartisan elections
 
07:16:00.270 --> 07:16:00.280 align:start position:0%
and we all know it's a joke we all know
 
07:16:01.868 --> 07:16:01.878 align:start position:0%
who the Republican is and by the way
 
07:16:03.910 --> 07:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
they spend a million dollars so it's not
 
07:16:05.788 --> 07:16:05.798 align:start position:0%
like and they they use the party mailers
 
07:16:06.788 --> 07:16:06.798 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that so it's not like
 
07:16:10.070 --> 07:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's not known but it's it's I I
 
07:16:11.350 --> 07:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
understand the opposition we're just
 
07:16:13.948 --> 07:16:13.958 align:start position:0%
bringing in the law in line with the
 
07:16:15.750 --> 07:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
town select boards and the municipal
 
07:16:17.548 --> 07:16:17.558 align:start position:0%
boards and I think you'll see increased
 
07:16:20.230 --> 07:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
voter turnout and I think as voter turns
 
07:16:21.388 --> 07:16:21.398 align:start position:0%
out you'll actually get boards that
 
07:16:23.350 --> 07:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative of it because you've got
 
07:16:25.150 --> 07:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
you know you've got it's very easy to go
 
07:16:26.990 --> 07:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
through the list of school boards across
 
07:16:28.830 --> 07:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
the state and find members on the school
 
07:16:30.388 --> 07:16:30.398 align:start position:0%
board that you wonder how did this
 
07:16:32.910 --> 07:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
person get elected and then you remember
 
07:16:34.990 --> 07:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
from this town and you remember oh yeah
 
07:16:37.628 --> 07:16:37.638 align:start position:0%
it's a 15% turnout election so it's
 
07:16:39.110 --> 07:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
really not even close to representative
 
07:16:41.510 --> 07:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
of the Town um and I've grinded this act
 
07:16:43.150 --> 07:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
before not about partisan elections in
 
07:16:45.230 --> 07:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
school district boards or town Town
 
07:16:47.548 --> 07:16:47.558 align:start position:0%
meetings I've grinded the acts before of
 
07:16:49.468 --> 07:16:49.478 align:start position:0%
our Municipal elections our really low
 
07:16:51.868 --> 07:16:51.878 align:start position:0%
turnout and the irony is the
 
07:16:54.310 --> 07:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
overwhelming vast majority of government
 
07:16:56.948 --> 07:16:56.958 align:start position:0%
that you interact with on a daily basis
 
07:17:00.910 --> 07:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
is your town government the I it's I'm
 
07:17:03.070 --> 07:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to end my rant here but it it
 
07:17:05.310 --> 07:17:05.320 align:start position:0%
is it's like stunning to me that the
 
07:17:06.868 --> 07:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
presidential election has the highest
 
07:17:09.030 --> 07:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
turnout when that has actually the least
 
07:17:10.990 --> 07:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
effect on people and the election that
 
07:17:13.590 --> 07:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
has the least turnout is the one that
 
07:17:15.110 --> 07:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
actually like runs people into
 
07:17:18.548 --> 07:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy so I my goal on voting for
 
07:17:21.150 --> 07:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
this it's enabling legislation
 
07:17:23.388 --> 07:17:23.398 align:start position:0%
my goal is of a town ad dosis I would
 
07:17:26.388 --> 07:17:26.398 align:start position:0%
put money down that the election would
 
07:17:27.948 --> 07:17:27.958 align:start position:0%
then see an increased turnout which has
 
07:17:29.910 --> 07:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
been a longterm goal of mine for these
 
07:17:31.830 --> 07:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
Town elections so that that's the end of
 
07:17:33.468 --> 07:17:33.478 align:start position:0%
my rant uh I'm happy anybody else who
 
07:17:35.430 --> 07:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
wants to tell me I'm wrong that's cool
 
07:17:35.440 --> 07:17:37.788 align:start position:0%
wants to tell me I'm wrong that's cool
representative

07:17:37.788 --> 07:17:37.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:17:41.708 --> 07:17:41.718 align:start position:0%
Bay tell me wrong thank you chairman
 
07:17:44.070 --> 07:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
Barry it's always en enlightening to
 
07:17:47.948 --> 07:17:47.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:52.590 --> 07:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
year um the to to the point of uh they
 
07:17:55.230 --> 07:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
don't know who the candidate is isn't
 
07:17:58.230 --> 07:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
that the point of campaigning I know
 
07:18:00.468 --> 07:18:00.478 align:start position:0%
that when I ran nobody knew who I was
 
07:18:04.110 --> 07:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
and I campaigned the heck out of it uh
 
07:18:06.830 --> 07:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
but um uh my other point is with with
 
07:18:10.270 --> 07:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
regard to making the laws the same so
 
07:18:14.468 --> 07:18:14.478 align:start position:0%
there's already an enabling um uh law to
 
07:18:18.270 --> 07:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
um or enabling statute to for for Town
 
07:18:21.350 --> 07:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
um elections to be partisan but I
 
07:18:23.910 --> 07:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
believe if I mean you can correct me if
 
07:18:27.110 --> 07:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong but uh during the hearing when
 
07:18:29.788 --> 07:18:29.798 align:start position:0%
it was asked how many uh towns have
 
07:18:32.230 --> 07:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of it I believe there
 
07:18:36.150 --> 07:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
was none so uh to the point of making
 
07:18:38.350 --> 07:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
the laws the same you can also do it the
 
07:18:42.468 --> 07:18:42.478 align:start position:0%
other way and um repeal that one so that
 
07:18:44.548 --> 07:18:44.558 align:start position:0%
there there's no
 
07:18:47.388 --> 07:18:47.398 align:start position:0%
enabling member is more than welcome to
 
07:18:48.628 --> 07:18:48.638 align:start position:0%
bring forward Amendment if we weren't
 
07:18:50.468 --> 07:18:50.478 align:start position:0%
going to vote on it today um
 
07:18:53.350 --> 07:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative K uh PR O'Brien thank you
 
07:18:56.430 --> 07:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
for allowing me time to rant because I
 
07:18:57.868 --> 07:18:57.878 align:start position:0%
have a rant that you overlooked me
 
07:19:00.868 --> 07:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
numerous times but okay but you know I
 
07:19:03.510 --> 07:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
agree with you on on nearly everything
 
07:19:05.590 --> 07:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
you said so that takes the sting out of
 
07:19:08.708 --> 07:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
my rant I have really just a little bit
 
07:19:11.868 --> 07:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
to say uh I have been a member of the
 
07:19:14.910 --> 07:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
library Board of Trustees numerous times
 
07:19:18.190 --> 07:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
and you'd think it was mostly a gential
 
07:19:19.990 --> 07:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
event and for the most part that's
 
07:19:22.350 --> 07:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely true we are we did
 
07:19:24.510 --> 07:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
not have a lot of partisan divide but
 
07:19:26.270 --> 07:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes there was some but that was
 
07:19:30.590 --> 07:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
very rare I think that this would help
 
07:19:32.910 --> 07:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
voters understand more about who they're
 
07:19:36.070 --> 07:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
voting for and also understand what the
 
07:19:43.150 --> 07:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
situation is if there is no um balance
 
07:19:44.788 --> 07:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
okay because I think a lot of people
 
07:19:46.868 --> 07:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
assume balance when there's
 
07:19:49.990 --> 07:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
nonpartisanship and it's not necessarily
 
07:19:50.990 --> 07:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
the case
 
07:19:53.510 --> 07:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm seeing more and more of that
 
07:19:57.270 --> 07:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
I think that we can o overcome uh the
 
07:19:59.948 --> 07:19:59.958 align:start position:0%
partisan nature of some of these things
 
07:20:02.948 --> 07:20:02.958 align:start position:0%
with the same sort of attitudes that we
 
07:20:05.948 --> 07:20:05.958 align:start position:0%
have here in this partisan body where we
 
07:20:09.388 --> 07:20:09.398 align:start position:0%
are polite to each other as as is POS
 
07:20:11.868 --> 07:20:11.878 align:start position:0%
every time it's possible um and then
 
07:20:12.750 --> 07:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
there was another point I was going to
 
07:20:14.150 --> 07:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
make it was kind of important and I
 
07:20:16.788 --> 07:20:16.798 align:start position:0%
forgot it so all right thank you further
 
07:20:18.670 --> 07:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
discussion on the bill the motion of
 
07:20:21.590 --> 07:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
ought to pass represent Brennan
 
07:20:24.590 --> 07:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
recognize thank you
 
07:20:27.628 --> 07:20:27.638 align:start position:0%
um I respectfully disagree with my
 
07:20:31.788 --> 07:20:31.798 align:start position:0%
colleague who seems to think that um
 
07:20:34.788 --> 07:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
engaging in partisan elections will
 
07:20:36.910 --> 07:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
bring together
 
07:20:39.430 --> 07:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
communities um and not further divide
 
07:20:42.310 --> 07:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
them because when I hear from my
 
07:20:44.910 --> 07:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
constituents they're tired of the
 
07:20:47.590 --> 07:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
division that happens with
 
07:20:49.948 --> 07:20:49.958 align:start position:0%
partisanship they want people to work
 
07:20:49.958 --> 07:20:50.910 align:start position:0%
partisanship they want people to work
together

07:20:50.910 --> 07:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
together
 
07:20:53.990 --> 07:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
and that is the basis for nonpartisan
 
07:20:56.548 --> 07:20:56.558 align:start position:0%
elections it is working together to
 
07:20:58.750 --> 07:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
serve the community and the people that
 
07:21:04.510 --> 07:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
you're neighbors with um as my colleague
 
07:21:06.350 --> 07:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
representative Bay pointed out there are
 
07:21:10.190 --> 07:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
zero towns that have enabled the
 
07:21:14.990 --> 07:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
partisan elections for municipal uh
 
07:21:17.670 --> 07:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
offices this is
 
07:21:21.030 --> 07:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
harmful to students we we heard that
 
07:21:24.510 --> 07:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
testimony from uh Barrett Christina that
 
07:21:26.628 --> 07:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
this would not be in the best interest
 
07:21:29.350 --> 07:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
of students and that our nonpartisan
 
07:21:32.590 --> 07:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
elections serve the students the best
 
07:21:36.270 --> 07:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
and if we are inserting
 
07:21:38.468 --> 07:21:38.478 align:start position:0%
hyperarc elections it would only
 
07:21:41.388 --> 07:21:41.398 align:start position:0%
contribute to more divisive rhetoric
 
07:21:43.548 --> 07:21:43.558 align:start position:0%
coming at the local
 
07:21:48.388 --> 07:21:48.398 align:start position:0%
level this is not a good thing we really
 
07:21:51.230 --> 07:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
really need to avoid
 
07:21:55.910 --> 07:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
enabling partisan elections for school
 
07:21:58.750 --> 07:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
boards okay and with that the
 
07:22:01.868 --> 07:22:01.878 align:start position:0%
clerk okay y representative PR thank you
 
07:22:05.070 --> 07:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
I I did remember what I wanted to say um
 
07:22:07.070 --> 07:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
I would feel differently about this if I
 
07:22:09.868 --> 07:22:09.878 align:start position:0%
could see more uh accurate reporting on
 
07:22:11.388 --> 07:22:11.398 align:start position:0%
what the opinions were of people that
 
07:22:13.310 --> 07:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
were running for these boards but I I
 
07:22:16.150 --> 07:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
feel sometimes in the last you know few
 
07:22:17.468 --> 07:22:17.478 align:start position:0%
years or so there's been some
 
07:22:19.350 --> 07:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
obfuscation on that I just want more
 
07:22:21.230 --> 07:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
information for people people in these
 
07:22:22.990 --> 07:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
elections I think that would increase
 
07:22:24.830 --> 07:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
turnout I think this would be a good
 
07:22:26.708 --> 07:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
thing thank you um nobody's going to
 
07:22:28.230 --> 07:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
change their mind on this so we're going
 
07:22:30.868 --> 07:22:30.878 align:start position:0%

amendment yes thank you uh for those of
 
07:29:21.628 --> 07:29:21.638 align:start position:0%
who those of us who are really well
 
07:29:24.190 --> 07:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
organized and have the original bill in
 
07:29:27.190 --> 07:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
front of them we're looking at page two
 
07:29:31.670 --> 07:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
line 31 where it simply says and either
 
07:29:34.708 --> 07:29:34.718 align:start position:0%
check one which is not really applicable
 
07:29:37.990 --> 07:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
if we change it to give only one option
 
07:29:40.750 --> 07:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
and that option is I would otherwise
 
07:29:42.830 --> 07:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
vote in person but I have concerns for
 
07:29:45.628 --> 07:29:45.638 align:start position:0%
my safety traveling in the storm when
 
07:29:48.030 --> 07:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
that's the case we no longer need and
 
07:29:51.230 --> 07:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
either check one as we previously did so
 
07:29:53.510 --> 07:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
that simply struck out and you can see
 
07:29:57.150 --> 07:29:57.160 align:start position:0%
that on page two line two and then I
 
07:29:58.830 --> 07:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
would otherwise vote in person but I
 
07:30:00.430 --> 07:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
have concerns for my safety traveling in
 
07:30:03.548 --> 07:30:03.558 align:start position:0%
the storm is now on line
 
07:30:06.230 --> 07:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
seven Is there further discussion on the
 
07:30:08.270 --> 07:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
amendment yes representative
 
07:30:10.628 --> 07:30:10.638 align:start position:0%
Lane I have a question and I don't
 
07:30:13.830 --> 07:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
remember who it was during the testimony
 
07:30:18.510 --> 07:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
um they brought up that under 657 colon
 
07:30:22.230 --> 07:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
one where we set out in the statute what
 
07:30:25.510 --> 07:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
the reasons are um have the two that we
 
07:30:29.628 --> 07:30:29.638 align:start position:0%
just deleted um but now the form doesn't
 
07:30:31.468 --> 07:30:31.478 align:start position:0%
match the
 
07:30:31.478 --> 07:30:33.350 align:start position:0%
match the
statute

07:30:33.350 --> 07:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
statute
 
07:30:37.948 --> 07:30:37.958 align:start position:0%
so I was just curious why we didn't
 
07:30:48.110 --> 07:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:50.750 --> 07:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
6572 that's I'm frantically Googling
 
07:30:50.760 --> 07:30:52.868 align:start position:0%
6572 that's I'm frantically Googling
hold

07:30:52.868 --> 07:30:52.878 align:start position:0%
hold
 
07:30:57.350 --> 07:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
on you'll Google all right
 
07:31:00.468 --> 07:31:00.478 align:start position:0%
657 and then you said Roman
 
07:31:07.110 --> 07:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:10.788 --> 07:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
numeral and you're looking at two and
 
07:31:13.190 --> 07:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
what were you looking to be changed well
 
07:31:16.468 --> 07:31:16.478 align:start position:0%
B it says now that that's a reason it
 
07:31:20.510 --> 07:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
says and we just deleted it off the form
 
07:31:24.388 --> 07:31:24.398 align:start position:0%
so I I'm curious as to whether we need
 
07:31:36.030 --> 07:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:48.270 --> 07:31:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:52.070 --> 07:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
them for adults because it's under the I
 
07:31:53.430 --> 07:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
I'm talking out loud so anybody feels
 
07:31:58.030 --> 07:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
feel free to jump in here um so
 
07:32:01.670 --> 07:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
6571 Roman numeral 2 when the national
 
07:32:02.948 --> 07:32:02.958 align:start position:0%
weather service has issued a winter
 
07:32:04.670 --> 07:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
storm warning blizzard warning or ice
 
07:32:05.868 --> 07:32:05.878 align:start position:0%
storm warning for election day
 
07:32:08.230 --> 07:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
applicable to the city town or
 
07:32:08.240 --> 07:32:10.110 align:start position:0%
applicable to the city town or
unincorporated

07:32:10.110 --> 07:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
unincorporated
 
07:32:14.510 --> 07:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
Place B says a person who cares for
 
07:32:17.830 --> 07:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
children or infirm adults who reasonably
 
07:32:19.388 --> 07:32:19.398 align:start position:0%
anticipates that school childcare or
 
07:32:21.230 --> 07:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
adult care will be canceled who
 
07:32:23.230 --> 07:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise would have voted in person but
 
07:32:24.750 --> 07:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
will be deterred from voting by the need
 
07:32:26.948 --> 07:32:26.958 align:start position:0%
to care for children or informed adults
 
07:32:28.468 --> 07:32:28.478 align:start position:0%
shall be considered shall be considered
 
07:32:29.750 --> 07:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
absent for the purpos of this chapter
 
07:32:31.110 --> 07:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
and may vote absentee on the day
 
07:32:34.110 --> 07:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
immediately prior to the election so the
 
07:32:37.190 --> 07:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
amendment Mr chairman I might be able to
 
07:32:42.270 --> 07:32:42.280 align:start position:0%
shed some light on that please do um the
 
07:32:45.070 --> 07:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
excuse for having of children or an
 
07:32:48.150 --> 07:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
infirm adult to care for is already
 
07:32:51.830 --> 07:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
covered early in uh
 
07:32:56.948 --> 07:32:56.958 align:start position:0%
6571 as uh being construed as employment
 
07:32:59.590 --> 07:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
so it's covered under the employment uh
 
07:33:03.830 --> 07:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
excuse earlier in that section and so in
 
07:33:08.190 --> 07:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
the winter weather portion of the excuse
 
07:33:10.548 --> 07:33:10.558 align:start position:0%
uh it's redundant and that is how they
 
07:33:14.830 --> 07:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
did it when they modified the uh
 
07:33:18.150 --> 07:33:18.160 align:start position:0%

representative katab is
 
07:35:25.388 --> 07:35:25.398 align:start position:0%
recognized I will be voting against this
 
07:35:28.350 --> 07:35:28.360 align:start position:0%
uh for a couple reasons one I believe
 
07:35:31.110 --> 07:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
section 112 of Mason's manual states
 
07:35:32.788 --> 07:35:32.798 align:start position:0%
that we should not legislate debate or
 
07:35:36.388 --> 07:35:36.398 align:start position:0%
discuss a matter um that's awaiting
 
07:35:38.510 --> 07:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
adjudication by before a Judicial
 
07:35:40.910 --> 07:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
tribunal and with the Dan Richards case
 
07:35:44.190 --> 07:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
I think that we're currently awaiting uh
 
07:35:46.308 --> 07:35:46.318 align:start position:0%
decision on that and I think the
 
07:35:49.788 --> 07:35:49.798 align:start position:0%
justices were pretty clear there that
 
07:35:51.830 --> 07:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
it wasn't permissive legislative
 
07:35:53.948 --> 07:35:53.958 align:start position:0%
judgment to exceed the authority of the
 
07:35:55.430 --> 07:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution the Constitution gave us
 
07:35:58.070 --> 07:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
two reasons for absentee voting and
 
07:35:59.910 --> 07:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
those two reasons were if you were going
 
07:36:02.350 --> 07:36:02.360 align:start position:0%
to be absent from the town or by reason
 
07:36:04.990 --> 07:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
of disability and they were also pretty
 
07:36:07.150 --> 07:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
clear that if that list was not meant to
 
07:36:08.788 --> 07:36:08.798 align:start position:0%
just be exclusive that it would have
 
07:36:11.708 --> 07:36:11.718 align:start position:0%
been superus to put those two reasons so
 
07:36:13.510 --> 07:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
for that reason I think they've kind of
 
07:36:14.788 --> 07:36:14.798 align:start position:0%
indicated even that they're going to
 
07:36:17.708 --> 07:36:17.718 align:start position:0%
rule in favor in that so I just I don't
 
07:36:19.350 --> 07:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
see a reason to put something out there
 
07:36:20.708 --> 07:36:20.718 align:start position:0%
that we know is going to be found
 
07:36:23.910 --> 07:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so thank
 
07:36:26.468 --> 07:36:26.478 align:start position:0%
you is that to toss out your independent
 
07:36:28.548 --> 07:36:28.558 align:start position:0%
