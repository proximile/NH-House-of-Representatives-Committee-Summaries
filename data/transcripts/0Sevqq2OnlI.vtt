is relative to qualifying medical
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
conditions for purposes of therapeutic
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis as a legislature we keep
 
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
identifying conditions allowed under the
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire therapeutic
 
00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:02.919 align:start position:0%
program since I've first worked as a rep
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
we've tackled insomnia opioid usage and
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
anxiety we keep adding new conditions as
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
they become known and how are they known
 
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
we read books and we talk to patients
 
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.240 align:start position:0%
I've actually connected online with two
 
00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
authors of um cannabis books this past
 
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
this past year um and ask them questions
 
00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:28.599 align:start position:0%
about about their research that they've
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
done they let us know how the program
 
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
works and how cannabis works I started
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
in the therapeutic program five years
 
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
ago because of chronic pain for me it
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
was a car versus a bike accident when I
 
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
was a kid since being in the program
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
I've also used cannabis for insomnia
 
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
eating issues gut issues PTSD
 
00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:55.959 align:start position:0%
PTSD and anxiety I have found relief
 
00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
from all of these symptoms some of which
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
of which are not covered in the
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
program I talked to many many people
 
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
about therapeutic cannabis they want to
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
get into the program they want to see if
 
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis helps their condition no one in
 
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis program uses cannabis to
 
00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
feel high or inebriated I spoke to a
 
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
caretaker in Maine and she shared with
 
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
me a wise truth if you're getting high
 
00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
on therapeutic on therapeutic cannabis
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
you're using it wrong however the
 
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
biggest concern I hear is will I qualify
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
because I don't fit into the current
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
patient model these are all examples of
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
cases that would not qualify but which
 
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
should in my humble opinion for the
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program I'm having
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
surgery and I understand it will be
 
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
painful for a few months cannabis can
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
help with that I have IBS but not
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
Crohn's disease cannabis can help with
 
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
that I have long Co I have a procedure
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
done regularly that gives me anxiety in
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
my my case that would be dental work I'm
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
getting older when I work out I'm really
 
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:05.720 align:start position:0%
sore the next
 
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
day and I've also heard many many times
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
over I have serious period
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
cramps the recent HHS report on
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
descheduling cannabis identifies
 
00:10:19.069 --> 00:10:19.079 align:start position:0%
additional uses that cannabis has been
 
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
found helpful for these conditions
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
include ALS autism wasting cancer
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
chronic pain Crohn's disease epilepsy or
 
00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:31.399 align:start position:0%
conditions causing features glaucoma HIV
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
AIDS multiple sclerosis Parkinson's
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
disease persistent severe muscle spasm
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
persistent severe nausea PTSD and
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
spasticity chronically ill patients are
 
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
not interested in being zoned out on the
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
couch we have had enough of that and we
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
want the coach to put us back in the
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
into the game so why are we potentially
 
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
denying New Hampshire patients relief
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
just because we haven't gotten around to
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
getting their symptoms or condition into
 
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
law and on a qualifying list I
 
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:02.839 align:start position:0%
understand that many Physicians are not
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
interested in anything about cannabis
 
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
however there are many Physicians who
 
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
are willing to learn about how this
 
00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
plant can help their patients they are
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
willing to look at reports and read
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
literature that gives new information
 
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
about possible uses they are willing to
 
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
let their patients try something
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
different that has been demonstrated to
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
work recently the the therapeutic
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis medical oversight board voted 7
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
to one to support this bill I'm going to
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
let the honorable Jerry kerk uh expand
 
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
one um and there's a repeal portion to
 
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
this bill that I'm going to let Mr Holt
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh speak to
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
that if this bill does not pass at the
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
very least you will see me here next
 
00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:52.279 align:start position:0%
term advocating that long covid
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
situational anxiety menstrual pain and
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
gut dysfunction be added as symptoms to
 
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
this program let's stop trying to
 
00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
practice medicine and let Physicians
 
00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:05.959 align:start position:0%
treat their patients as they see fit I'm
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for
 
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.670 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for
representative

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
Thomas representative
 
00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:17.959 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
you for taking this question you sort of
 
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
addressed this but um given the way the
 
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
um medical cannabis law works now with
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
specific conditions only
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you've had talks with
 
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
Physicians about their preference in
 
00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
terms of having a lot more subjectivity
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
as they would have um if your bill were
 
00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
to become law um and whether they feel
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
more comfortable being able to um
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
qualify People based on categories or
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
whether they would have would be more
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable having um a great deal more
 
00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
discretion as your bill would give
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
them the Physicians that I've spoken to
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
that Embrace uh therapeutic Canabis
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh that
 
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
Embrace therapeutic cannabis and that go
 
00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
out of their way to understand it are
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
very open to prescribing it for
 
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:18.680 align:start position:0%
additional uh symptoms that are not on
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
on the the the
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
list um the the case that that comes up
 
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
to mind is that
 
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
um so I had had massive um I think I've
 
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
testified before I have cancer and so
 
00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:36.279 align:start position:0%
I've had three massive cancer surgeries
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
the last surgery that I had which was a
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
revision to to take care of
 
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
complications I had from previous
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
surgeries The Physician prescribed
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
opioids two weeks before surgery to make
 
00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:50.839 align:start position:0%
sure that I had it in hand for use
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
afterwards it was not an ongoing
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
prescription is a one-time prescription
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
I've talked to Physicians that have said
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
they would like theer opportunity to
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
prescribe the Cannabis program for
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
postsurgery pain as AO I mean we can
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
prescribe opioids but we can't right now
 
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
prescribe therapeutic cannabis which has
 
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
been proven by that HHS report to uh
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
help with with pain so um it's cases
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
like that there's also cases um and I
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
haven't spoken to a lot of Physicians
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to my primary physician who
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
is very open to this I've spoken to some
 
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.189 align:start position:0%
is very open to this I've spoken to some
surgeons

00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
surgeons
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
who are somewhat open um but a lot of
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
them have said that that especially now
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
that HHS has proven that it is a
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
medicine that that is that works they
 
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to use it in other
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
instances follow up thank you so are I
 
00:14:50.749 --> 00:14:50.759 align:start position:0%
should know more about this than I do
 
00:14:54.509 --> 00:14:54.519 align:start position:0%
but I don't so um so are you saying that
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
in anticipation of a surgery which will
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
probably cause a great deal of pain
 
00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
um that is not that is not a legitimate
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
use of medical cannabis now because the
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
person is not in pain yet correct or
 
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
short or short term correct the
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
qualification is chronic pain and I
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
think chronic pain is defined as it's
 
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
either three or six months and I believe
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
um The Honorable Jerry coner can can is
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
it three or
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
six all right it's it's a defined amount
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
of time so if for example I'm having an
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
artificial knee joint replay or joint
 
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
put in that's going to be painful for a
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
certain amount of time and then it's not
 
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
going to be painful so that situation is
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
situational pain it's not chronic
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
pain representative Lon uh thank you Mr
 
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you so much for
 
00:15:48.269 --> 00:15:48.279 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill to us um I'm not I I
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
assume you probably are aware that
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
there's a discussion in changing the
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
schedule federally from class one to
 
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
class three but as a class three drug it
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
would be most likely treated as any
 
00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
other um FDA regulated drug which may
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
actually have implications in uh the
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
recreational Market which would
 
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
foreclose any opportunity for people to
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
seek out recreational cannabis for what
 
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
is actually a medical need do you think
 
00:16:14.189 --> 00:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
that this bill would actually allow us
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
to protect more people if uh cannabis
 
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
starts being actually being treated um
 
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
access their access to cannabis is
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
actually restricted um if as a class
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
three drug the FDA starts to
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:32.749 align:start position:0%
three drug the FDA starts to
intervene

00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
yes sorry I know that was a big question
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
um you know I mean the the the
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
rescheduling it it's about time it's
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
about time we all you know those of us
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
that are in this field we know that
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
cannabis works we know that there are
 
00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
less uh biological effects on the body
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
it is more if you're in pain it is more
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
healthier for your body to take cannabis
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
your liver and your kidneys are going to
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
thank you as opposed to self-medicating
 
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
with alcohol which is what a lot of
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
people do now because we don't have
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
access um I have access to cannabis but
 
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't have access to
 
00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:12.630 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't have access to
cannabis

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
um as far as as more people being open
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
to the or have access to the program if
 
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
you look at the financial note um
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom it says though
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
indeterminable the department estimates
 
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
the bill may result in up to a 10% %
 
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
growth increasing Revenue by
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
$70,000 per year which would uh function
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
to um to lower the application fee so
 
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
this this bill Not only would it help
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
Physicians treat their patients um it
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
would also help the patients in that it
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
would lower costs so I don't know if
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
that answered everything thank you it
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
did and I apologize for peeking around a
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
couple corners but working as a medical
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
device analyst for a long time I know
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
that sometimes the FDA does interesting
 
00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799 align:start position:0%
things so that's why I wanted to ask you
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
about that and I appreciate your answer
 
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
yeah thank
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
you other
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
chairman um I had the privilege or I'm
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
not sure what it was of being chairman
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
of the committee I think it ran for four
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
or five years so I wondered if you talk
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%

the chairman of a of a continuing
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
Committee in other words the the work
 
00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:44.919 align:start position:0%
has been going on for quite a while so I
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
wondered if you have involved yourself
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
with those two
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
gentlemen in in preparation for this
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%

00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
brick walls that's the wrong
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
analogy they're very important uh
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%

reliable whatever that is invaluable
resource

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
resource
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
valuable resource thank you thank you Mr
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
chair other
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
questions I actually have one
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas you had mentioned
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
long Co and what were the other
 
00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:40.039 align:start position:0%
conditions you were talking about um if
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
you don't mind repeating them oh sure um
 
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
long covid situational anxiety which
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
um that means if you have a regular
 
00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:54.039 align:start position:0%
procedure like if you have a cancer scan
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
or if you have dental work um a lot of
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
people get anxiety and doctors prescribe
 
00:20:00.669 --> 00:20:00.679 align:start position:0%
Valium for that um and we could
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
prescribe cannabis um menstrual pain is
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
a huge one um ask any college female
 
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
what they use for menstrual pain and
 
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
almost all of them will say cannabis or
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
that they know that cannabis helps and
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
gut dis gut dysfunction which would
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
cover IBS and gut dysfunction that is
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
not Crohn's
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
disease and that's just a very short
 
00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:29.559 align:start position:0%
list that is a very short list
 
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
there's so many things out there and if
 
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
second these are the books that I read
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
about cannabis and every time I see a
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
new symptom I write it
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
down looks pretty thorough yeah yeah I
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
yeah some people read novels I read
 
00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:57.799 align:start position:0%
cannabis books um but it's it's so
 
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
important and the thing is it's people
 
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
use cannabis the way people use alcohol
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
so alcohol was invented for us to sort
 
00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
of recreationally feel good right but
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
when my babies were teething what was I
 
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
told rub Whiskey on their gums so we've
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
learned we've adapted we've found a new
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
use for alcohol when I was young and I
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
was sick with uh with bronchitis or
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
something my mother would give me
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
something that she called Grandma's
 
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.710 align:start position:0%
something that she called Grandma's
recipe

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
recipe
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's hot tea lemon honey and Crown Royal
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
whiskey so we've learned to use uh
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
alcohol in different ways and people
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
have learned to use cannabis in
 
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
different ways and once again and this
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
is why we can never get rid of this
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
program it needs education it need we
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
need to to teach the patients how to use
 
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis and if you are using the
 
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
therapeutic program to get inebriated
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
you're not doing it correctly
 
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
questions I'm see no other question
 
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:16.510 align:start position:0%
questions I'm see no other question
thank

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is former
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um yes for the record
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
my name is Jerry kerk and I'm the chair
 
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis medical
 
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.630 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis medical
oversight

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
board the also known as TCM o and TCM o
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
is uh comprised primarily of providers
 
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
and is statutorily charged with
 
00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:48.919 align:start position:0%
oversight medical oversight of the
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
program um when representative Thomas
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
has already covered a number of the
 
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
issues about things that cannabis us it
 
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
works for and there's a lot of evidence
 
00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
uh strong evidence in addition to
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
anecdotal and our program serves about
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
13,000 patients uh most of them are
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
between ages 50 and 70 uh yes TCM did
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
vote 7 to1 to support this
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
bill now to understand the importance of
 
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
this bill or the impact of this bill
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand the rather
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
cumbersome produ process of
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
certification to be able to use cannabis
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
as a therapeutic cannabis patient since
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
it is a schedule one drug it cannot be
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
prescribed by a provider so therefore
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
the pr the provider uh has to certify
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
the patient as having both a medical
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
qualifying condition and a qualifying
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
symptom the statute then confers
 
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
protection upon the patient for the use
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
of cannabis for that particular uh
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
condition and symptom knowledge of the
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
use of therapeutic use of cannabis is is
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
growing a great deal it's been hampered
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
because of it being a schedule one drug
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
but in any case it's still growing and
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
bills are filed every year to request
 
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
new conditions be approved and one of
 
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
the primary jobs of tcob is really in a
 
00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
way to act like the FDA we don't really
 
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
but we sort of like that we review bills
 
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
and see whether there's sufficient
 
00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:20.919 align:start position:0%
evidence of benefit of cannabis to allow
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
the condition to be placed in statute
 
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
and then we REM we recommend it to the
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
legislature who then acts upon it
 
00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
so the point is hp1 1278 offers an
 
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
alternative process for certifying and
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
that's important to realize it doesn't
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
just say a whole bunch of other
 
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
conditions are good it doesn't say that
 
00:24:42.389 --> 00:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
but it offers an alternative process
 
00:24:44.269 --> 00:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
allowing more provider discretion but
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
with clear safeguards in
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
place the provider still does not
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
directly prescribe cannabis because we
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
can't but they then certify that a
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
patient has either a condition or a
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
symptom for which in their clinical
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
opinion they feel that the benefits of
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis would outweigh the risks
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's been discussion in the past
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
about just get getting rid of this list
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
of qualifying conditions and symptoms
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
and just make patient certification at
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the provider that's
 
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
been discussed in the past but we have
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
to realize that not all providers have a
 
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
good knowledge of the therapeutic use of
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis and they don't have an FDA to
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
guide them as to what you know whether
 
00:25:24.909 --> 00:25:24.919 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable or not so this bill is a
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
very good compromise and that it allows
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
some provider discretion for those who
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
are knowledgeable about therapeutic
 
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis the way I've been looking at it
 
00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
is it really sets up a two tier system
 
00:25:36.679 --> 00:25:37.789 align:start position:0%
is it really sets up a two tier system
for

00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:39.799 align:start position:0%
certification P providers who really
 
00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
have a very limited knowledge of the
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use of cannabis would still
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
use the standard approach of Consulting
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
a list of statutory conditions and
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
symptoms to certify a patient that route
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
would still be present in statute the
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
new tier would be available for the
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
providers who do know more about the
 
00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.230 align:start position:0%
providers who do know more about the
therapeutic

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
therapeutic
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis it they they they feel that
 
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
they can make a reasonable appropriate
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
decision as far as the risks and
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
benefits of cannabis just as they make
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
an informed decision on the use of any
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
other medication including the off Lael
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
use of FDA medications so in other words
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
if you don't know a whole lot you can
 
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
look at the list and say yep you've got
 
00:26:24.909 --> 00:26:24.919 align:start position:0%
chronic pain I'll certify you got that
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
the state says that's okay you're
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
protected the person who spends a lot of
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
time and is really kept up on that
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
literature can say you know it's not on
 
00:26:34.389 --> 00:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
that list but I really think it's a good
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
chance this will help you and in your
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
case the benefits outweigh the risks and
 
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to certify you so it's an
 
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.350 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to certify you so it's an
alternative

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
approach um a couple of minor issues but
 
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
are important though if we look uh at
 
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
the bill on lines four and five the word
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
that is used is or for this Standalone
 
00:26:54.909 --> 00:26:54.919 align:start position:0%
qualifying condition but the word in
 
00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
statute currently for regular is and
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
now the point is that when the program
 
00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
was designed you had to have a condition
 
00:27:06.669 --> 00:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
and you also had to have a symptom and
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's hard to link a condition
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
and a symptom together sometimes our our
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
prescribing is is uh basically
 
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
symptom-driven so for example they say
 
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
you have a stuffy nose we don't go to
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
all kinds of detailed testing to try to
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
figure out exactly whether you got a
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
cold or you got a flu or whatever just
 
00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
prescribe a decongestant for the stuff
 
00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
you knows it's a symptom-driven
 
00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
prescribing so this bill allows in a way
 
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
a symptom-driven
 
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
prescribing so let's say you have some
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
anxiety we don't have to delve into all
 
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
the reasons why you do we you could be
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
certified um there are safeguards that
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
are really quite good in this bill as
 
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
well the it limits provider discretion
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh to certification of adults 21 years
 
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
of age older and that's really quite
 
00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate given the risk of cannabis
 
00:27:58.399 --> 00:27:59.269 align:start position:0%
appropriate given the risk of cannabis
in

00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
kids Mr con if you could start wrapping
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
up please yep I I have two sentences I
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
think left uh limiting provider
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
discretion as well to debilitating or
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
terminal medical conditions or symptoms
 
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
also assures it will only be used in
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
impactful conditions and symptoms and
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
not capric capriciously so bottom line
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
in summary TCM urges passage of 1278 to
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
enable provider discretion in certifying
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
patients to streamline the certification
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
process and I'd be glad to take any
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you
 
00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:33.110 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you

00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:41.799 align:start position:0%
see you back here in the chamber thank
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
you in regards to Providers one of the
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
things I think I heard was the level of
 
00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559 align:start position:0%
knowledge the provider may have dealing
 
00:28:51.559 --> 00:28:52.430 align:start position:0%
knowledge the provider may have dealing
with

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis is there a possibility then to
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
create a certification of those
 
00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
providers who have that knowledge and if
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
they have it let them at that point in
 
00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
time not have to deal with a list and at
 
00:29:07.389 --> 00:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
that point in time if you have somebody
 
00:29:09.549 --> 00:29:09.559 align:start position:0%
who doesn't have that level of knowledge
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
certification whatever we call it then
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
you go into a list of what you have what
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
you can and cannot do I'm just trying to
 
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
look at it and saying how do we take
 
00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:19.519 align:start position:0%
some of the barriers out of this if the
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
provider has the appropriate knowledge
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
then why are we micromanaging it well
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
the from the beginning the program has
 
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
not required a provider to be certified
 
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
and the reason partly is it would add a
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
cumbersome bureaucracy we'd have to
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
develop some kind of um testing
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
procedure to determine competency um in
 
00:29:43.509 --> 00:29:43.519 align:start position:0%
many respects you think about it any
 
00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
provider is already if they're already
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
licensed and they already are
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh they ALS also have a DEA license
 
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
they've already demonstrated a level of
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
competence in terms of understanding and
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
thinking about medications and we
 
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.240 align:start position:0%
certainly do that if we prescribe an off
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
Lael use of an FDA approved medication
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the FDA isn't backing
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
us on that because the company didn't go
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
through the you know years of testing
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
and hundreds of millions of dollars but
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
instead you're saying look we got pretty
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
decent evidence that it works in this
 
00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:18.919 align:start position:0%
and they make that judgment and you know
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
I mean in general I would hope that for
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
me as a spine surgeon I wasn't going
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
there and doing all kinds of off label
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
prescribing for psychiatric medicine I
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't because I I didn't know that
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
stuff I'm not being I'm not trained in
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
that so as a result you would hope that
 
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
the provider would use their usual
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
discretion of saying um they I I I know
 
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
enough I can do this or I don't know
 
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
enough I can do this but I think that
 
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
certification just adds more
 
00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.029 align:start position:0%
certification just adds more
administrative

00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
burden thank you thank you Mr chair I
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
concur with what you're talking about Dr
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
kerk however by creating a list in the
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
statute and what we're doing here we're
 
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
creating another level of bureaucracy so
 
00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:04.519 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to find out how to minimize
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
that level of bureaucracy I know we're
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
creating another level of bureaucracy
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
but there one less honorous than the
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
other that's what I'm trying to get to
 
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
well I think one of the things about
 
00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:15.799 align:start position:0%
this in this bill it doesn't require
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
that that we have a bureaucracy to
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
assess whether that provider's decision
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
is appropriate that is not in the bill
 
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
which I think is okay because again we
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
don't do that for non FDA approved drug
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
label use but instead you we have a
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility if some provider is
 
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
really going off the wall and doing some
 
00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
pretty weird things just as they would
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
for standard uh FDA approved medications
 
00:31:43.389 --> 00:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
the board their disciplinary board would
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
look into this that that's where any
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
thing would go but that' have to be
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
pretty egregious as it would have to be
 
00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:49.240 align:start position:0%
for regular
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
medicines thank you representative
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
Missour thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
doctor for taking my question um here it
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
says that TCM o voted 7 to1 to support
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
this bill um just
 
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
curious what was the reasoning that one
 
00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
person did not um yeah see I'm looking
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
quickly at my
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.039 --> 00:32:20.990 align:start position:0%
 
recall

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
recall
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I do not recall why that
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
person voted
 
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
against sorry and I don't recall who it
 
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
was my
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
apologies representative Shapiro and
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
then representative Lon I'm I'm sorry
 
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
you had a follow up I'm sorry would it
 
00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
be possible to get that
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
information um May I consult with I'd be
 
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just really curious to know that I
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't know if uh Mr Holt
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
does that's right that's okay that's
 
00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
that's who I thought it was but I wasn't
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
sure um he confirmed for me that the
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
person who voted no actually did not
 
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
participate in the discussion he didn't
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
say anything about why he felt that way
 
00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
he just voted no so I was pretty sure
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
that I that I just didn't want to State
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
something I wasn't certain of okay
 
00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:12.519 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro and then
 
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
chairman to piggyback on the um previous
 
00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.750 align:start position:0%
chairman to piggyback on the um previous
question

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:25.149 --> 00:33:25.159 align:start position:0%
um you had pretty pretty good consensus
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
but not complete consensus um and if you
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
don't know what that person's reasons
 
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
were um certainly you've encountered or
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
maybe you've encountered other pres not
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
prescribers but um what's the proper
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
word um you've encountered other um
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
people who were able to qualify people
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
who are resistant to this idea of more
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
discretion more subjectivity um if you
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
have yeah what what would the what would
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
the argument on the other side be I
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
think often times it just rolls down to
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
saying well you know we we don't have
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
the FDA to really kind of give us the
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
backup we don't have as much of data as
 
00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:12.919 align:start position:0%
we would like and we certainly agree
 
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
with that this is something that's
 
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
proactive I mean you know any provider
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
really ought to be looking at the data
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
before they start giving people
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
medications and if it's pretty weak they
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
might want to think twice about that and
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's true in cannabis as well I think
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
it's important to
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
realize running this particular board
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
tcob is really like hurting cats because
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
I've got people who are basically almost
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
anti-cannabis to people who are very Pro
 
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis and trying to get even close to
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
unanimous is a real task and it takes a
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
lot of work so but that gives us
 
00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
strength because it means we don't just
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
all kind of lock Step Go the same way we
 
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
end up trying to compromise with what we
 
00:34:56.829 --> 00:34:56.839 align:start position:0%
come up with on our recommend
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
commendations because we have to because
 
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
I if I walk in here with a four to six
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation it didn't mean a whole
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
lot to
 
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
you representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you so much for
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
coming back and uh all your involvement
 
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
in this um my question is um has to do
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
with the bill that we we passed last
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
year last term about the off Lael
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
prescribing where for the FDA approved
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
drugs somebody would have protection
 
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
from um an inquiry from the licensing
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
board um if they prescribed
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
FDA approved drug off label um it would
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
be my understanding that the medical
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
board has no such restrictions on
 
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
looking into any pres any any
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations that people have for
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis so that if it appears that this
 
00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:43.079 align:start position:0%
is this is moving out of control the
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
medical board would probably be the
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate place and they're fully
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
enabled to do so is that your
 
00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
understanding too well that that's my
 
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
understanding too is that any if
 
00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
somebody is really going off the wall
 
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
that the medical board would be just
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
like they would for anything else if
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
people are doing inappropriate surgeries
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
or they're doing uh prescribing of FDA
 
00:36:02.829 --> 00:36:02.839 align:start position:0%
drugs inappropriately it's the medical
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
board that would say wait a minute you
 
00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
know that this is not the standard of
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
practice not even
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
close thank you yes yes pres McLean
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
my question um with respect to the the
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
21y year age restriction um in in the uh
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
in the in the new edition that doesn't
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
exist in the existing schedule since
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
you're kind of creating two-tier those
 
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
familiar those providers who are
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
familiar versus those who are not
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
um would you not want to have that
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
available to folks younger than 21 um so
 
00:36:39.069 --> 00:36:39.079 align:start position:0%
what would if you could dive a little
 
00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:40.599 align:start position:0%
bit deeper into the thinking as to why
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
that restriction is there well we do
 
00:36:44.309 --> 00:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
have a restriction for minors in the
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
program already and they require a
 
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
second certification so if you're seeing
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
a specialist who says gee you know I
 
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
think you would be benefiting uh you
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
benefit from the use of therapeutic
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis you have to get a secondary
 
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.190 align:start position:0%
cannabis you have to get a secondary
certification

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
from a medical provider that currently
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
says from a pediatrician we have a bill
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
in the Senate which trying to change
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
that to be a provider who provides
 
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
pediatric care because so it could be a
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
family practice person because in the
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
reality a lot of people don't have
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
pediatricians up in the North Country um
 
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
so there is that's why we only have
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
about 10 kids certified in the program
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
because there are rather robust
 
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
safeguards and we feel that that is a
 
00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
setting where you want to have uh in a
 
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:28.839 align:start position:0%
sense the approval of TCM o in the
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
legislature that it's okay to prescribe
 
00:37:32.829 --> 00:37:32.839 align:start position:0%
in that setting but even there we have
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
battles uh internally in TCM o about you
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
know what we still allow for kids so we
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
didn't with this is a provider
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
discretion we are comfortable with the
 
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
idea that we would not provide
 
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
discretion for that age group under 21
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
be a little more rigid on that followup
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
so so even with a secondary um
 
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.230 align:start position:0%
so so even with a secondary um
recommendation

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
noo well that that's currently how this
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
is written and that's what we agreed
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
with I think that certainly could be an
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
amendment that could be placed saying
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
that it could be at any age but anybody
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
under 21 requires certification by a
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
provider of pediatric care that could be
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
placed in his Amendment but I think the
 
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
demand for that will be relatively small
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure thank you very much yes
 
00:38:21.119 --> 00:38:22.670 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure thank you very much yes
other

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing n thank you okay thank
 
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.230 align:start position:0%
questions seeing n thank you okay thank
you

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
oh actually may I say just one other
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
quick thing about the schedule three
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about that for
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
decades we've been talking you know this
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
to wait for that doesn't make sense I
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
think it's okay to move with this if it
 
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
becomes moot
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
great also signed up to speak is
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
committee members uh I really appreciate
 
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
you having me here today so I really
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
support this bill because of my own
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
personal experiences uh when I was 16
 
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
years old I broke my back I had an L4
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
burst fracture and uh 2020 I had a uh
 
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
one of those rods actually broke uh so I
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
had to have a secondary surgery to take
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
all of that Hardware out and uh through
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
that I dealt with a lot of chronic pain
 
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
I still do and uh I am uh currently uh
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
on I'm a part of the uh therapeutic
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis program
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
and that was a challenge for me to get
 
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
on it was a long process dealing with
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
pain management doctors over at
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
Wentworth Douglas they did a good job of
 
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
making sure that I uh was following the
 
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
proper procedures and uh were taking
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
proper care before moving on and going
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
through uh the uh the Cannabis route
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
because I have refused uh any opiates I
 
00:39:57.069 --> 00:39:57.079 align:start position:0%
prefer not to uh take them if I can and
 
00:39:59.790 --> 00:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
it it's something where uh luckily we
 
00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
have changed the requirement to uh
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
remove the uh secondary uh testing of
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
medications before you move on to uh the
 
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
Cannabis program and I think that there
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
are potentially a number of other people
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
suffering from other conditions that are
 
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
allowed in other states but we haven't
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily prove them here for our
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
qualifying conditions and going through
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
an allowing ing providers to make the
 
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
proper decision for their patients and
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
what would fit them best I think would
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
serve the state well that's all I have
 
00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
you any questions for representative
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%

Holt from the Department of Health and

Services

00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Michael Holt I'm
 
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
the administrator of the therapeutic
 
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis program I've been involved with
 
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
the program since in its Inception in
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
2013 um thank thank you for the few
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
minutes that I two minutes that I can uh
 
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
take to to add some clarity to this bill
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
I wanted to point out that there is
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
another provision in this bill that
 
00:41:20.589 --> 00:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
hasn't been discussed this is the repeal
 
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
this is line nine where it uh the bill
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
proposed bill would repeal RSA 126
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
x2v relative to limitations for a
 
00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.109 align:start position:0%
x2v relative to limitations for a
visiting

00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
visiting
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
patient so this bill would remove those
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions for visiting out ofate
 
00:41:40.109 --> 00:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
patients uh on in 2021 the uh the state
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
law changed to allow out ofate patients
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
to access the New Hampshire dispensaries
 
00:41:46.589 --> 00:41:46.599 align:start position:0%
um and currently the law says that a
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
visiting patient can have three visits
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
at per year at a New Hampshire
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
dispensary um and after which they need
 
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
to show medical documentation that they
 
00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
have a medical condition on the New
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire list so when this when this
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
law was proposed in
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
2021 um a parity issue was raised um New
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a smaller restrictive list
 
00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
of qualifying conditions than many other
 
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
states and more importantly New
 
00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not have what's being
 
00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
proposed here which is a a catchall an
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
any condition catchall that provides
 
00:42:20.589 --> 00:42:20.599 align:start position:0%
discretion to Providers broadly for
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
certification of any condition so the
 
00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
concern was raised in the Senate that it
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
would not be fair to New Hampshire
 
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
citizens if we allowed an out ofate
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
patient who was certified in their state
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
for a condition not on the New Hampshire
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
list say anxiety to access the New
 
00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:38.750 align:start position:0%
list say anxiety to access the New
Hampshire

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
atc's when New Hampshire citizens
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't access the program with the
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
same condition so they put in this this
 
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
parody uh uh Clause that says you get
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
three visits before you have to show
 
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
that you have a New Hampshire condition
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
so this bill as proposed would add such
 
00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
a catch-all any condition
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
um creating parody with other states
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
it's very common for other states to
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
allow certification for any condition
 
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
based on provider discretion New
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not so if the bill as
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
proposed moves forward to allow any
 
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
condition it removes this parody issue
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to give you uh give the
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
committee the knowledge about what that
 
00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
repeal provision was about I'm happy to
 
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
answer questions about that or anything
 
00:43:23.549 --> 00:43:23.559 align:start position:0%
else with regard to the bill I would say
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
one thing the department can
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
operationalize this uh new uh two-tiered
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
certification system without issue by
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
amending U the written
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.589 --> 00:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
you for taking this question
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
um Dr kerk mentioned the two-tier system
 
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
and you just mentioned it again so what
 
00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:43:55.549 --> 00:43:55.559 align:start position:0%
purpose of having a two-tier system and
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
what potential potential downside is
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
there to having a two-tier system if the
 
00:44:04.349 --> 00:44:04.359 align:start position:0%
um if if the medical providers are going
 
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
to have this great discretion why have
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
the conditions remain in the statute
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
there why not repeal all the the
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
specific conditions and just have um
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
provider discretion well that is not the
 
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
bill in front of us right um I'd be
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
happy to talk about a different model um
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
the legislature has uh in the past uh
 
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
reviewed a bill that would have repealed
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
all the conditions and given providers
 
00:44:38.589 --> 00:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
complete discretion with no guidance
 
00:44:40.589 --> 00:44:40.599 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um and that and that was
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
killed a number of years ago um and so
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
based on that legislative history a uh a
 
00:44:47.549 --> 00:44:47.559 align:start position:0%
model that keeps the current system but
 
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
adds another uh uh way of of C for
 
00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
certification I Believe by the sponsors
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
was uh was the way forward at this time
 
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
um the current system is inadequate it
 
00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
prevents people from accessing the
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
program even if their providers uh see
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
value um in trying this alternative
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
therapy um and so the the current system
 
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
is does restricts access um it restricts
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
provider discretion and so that's why we
 
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
need at least this additional process
 
00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:19.630 align:start position:0%
need at least this additional process
for

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.470 align:start position:0%
for
certification

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
um I'd be happy to consider other models
 
00:45:26.549 --> 00:45:26.559 align:start position:0%
but it was that model that you're
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
proposing was killed a number of years
 
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
ago follow up follow up um thank you for
 
00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
your answer and I I I'm probably was I
 
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
was asking for an opinion on which is
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
preferable but you're probably not the
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
to I'm in favor of whatever uh models
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
allow access to as many patients who
 
00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
want to try this alternative therapy and
 
00:45:56.109 --> 00:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
have the support of their physician or
 
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
their the medical provider uh to access
 
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
the program thank you representative
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
McCay thank you Mr
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr Holt has been involved with
 
00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
with this for years in fact he was
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
probably the only person in the
 
00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:20.559 align:start position:0%
department that uh did this work for a
 
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
very long time so he should be commended
 
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
for that the the one question I have is
 
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:29.829 align:start position:0%
for that the the one question I have is
that

00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
this process will produce
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
$70,000 a year and that
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
$70,000 goes outside of the department
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
the department has um it it
 
00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.390 align:start position:0%
the department has um it it
says

00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:46:50.549 --> 00:46:50.559 align:start position:0%
um where is
 
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
it apply to the program there will be a
 
00:46:58.109 --> 00:46:58.119 align:start position:0%
application received by the department
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
the department estimates the
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
bill under it sounds as if it lowers the
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
cost for the people providing the
 
00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
marijuana instead of increasing some
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
staff uh uh function uh so if the 70,000
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
is staying in the department then I'm
 
00:47:26.829 --> 00:47:26.839 align:start position:0%
curious as to how that is being spent
 
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
and uh whether that's giving you some
 
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
support uh uh out of that
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
7,000 well first of all thank you for
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
the uh the generous words um I have been
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
working on the program for uh for about
 
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
10 years um and um so thank you for that
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
with regard to the fiscal note um the uh
 
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
LBA recently changed their uh change
 
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
their processes whereby when we do
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes for proposed legis ation uh
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
we can no longer say indeterminable
 
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
without having a range so part of this
 
00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
this information is specifically in
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
response to LBA rules for us to um
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
provide an estimate when we really do
 
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
not know what kind of fiscal impact this
 
00:48:17.069 --> 00:48:17.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
so so so that's that's that's one thing
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
we I believe that this will result in
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
many more patients uh being certified
 
00:48:28.589 --> 00:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
for the program but I also believe that
 
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
this proposal will
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
reorient um uh patients currently on the
 
00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:37.720 align:start position:0%
program the next year for certification
 
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
a doctor will use this second tier to
 
00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
certify um uh anxiety for instance many
 
00:48:46.349 --> 00:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
people are being certified under PTSD
 
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
when they have anxiety and perhaps don't
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
have a a diagnosis of PTSD so I it's
 
00:48:53.549 --> 00:48:53.559 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say how much this is going
 
00:48:56.789 --> 00:48:56.799 align:start position:0%
to improve the revenue um that being
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
said this program is 100% self-funded
 
00:49:03.069 --> 00:49:03.079 align:start position:0%
through patient fees and through ATC
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
licensing fees and so whatever Revenue
 
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
that we get the the state gets from
 
00:49:14.789 --> 00:49:14.799 align:start position:0%
patients if that is less than our costs
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
we will build the atcs for the
 
00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
difference so that's what this is this
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
is trying to describe um I will say with
 
00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:25.160 align:start position:0%
regard to Patient fees uh two years ago
 
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
the just uh the law changed to allow
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
providers to issue certifications up to
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
three years um we did not raise our rate
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
we did not raise our fees our fees have
 
00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
been $50 uh uh for um a card since day
 
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
one and now under the new law with a
 
00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
three-year certification the fees are
 
00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:46.799 align:start position:0%
still $50 $50 for one year $50 for three
 
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
years so we're at we're at place of
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
stability with the the the the program
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
finances um and so I don't uh I would
 
00:49:55.079 --> 00:49:56.030 align:start position:0%
finances um and so I don't uh I would
not

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:49:59.549 --> 00:49:59.559 align:start position:0%
characterize this bill and this language
 
00:50:02.349 --> 00:50:02.359 align:start position:0%
as suggesting that money will go outside
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
the system it's more of a description
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
about how the system works where when we
 
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:07.720 align:start position:0%
don't receive enough revenue from
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
patients we're allowed to build the atcs
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
difference thank you very much because
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
it it concerned me that there's been
 
00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
such a lack of support for this program
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
that the money would be going elsewhere
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
and if it's not I'm very pleased to hear
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
that it's a dedicated fund all the money
 
00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:29.799 align:start position:0%
stays in the system we've been uh
 
00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
working for years to stabilize the
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
program uh we have sufficient support in
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
the department now um under the division
 
00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:39.640 align:start position:0%
of Public Health Services um and um to
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
to the extent that we were you know we
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
were we were able to essentially reduce
 
00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:49.240 align:start position:0%
patient fees by two-thirds based on that
 
00:50:51.789 --> 00:50:51.799 align:start position:0%
um uh that recent legislation that
 
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
allowed threeyear certifications thank
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you other question
 
00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
you uh the last person signed up to
 
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
testify this morning on U House Bill
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis thank you Mr chairman honorable
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Matt
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
Simon I currently work for granite Leaf
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh no problem uh we're one of
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
the three alternative treatment center
 
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
companies in New Hampshire uh nonprofit
 
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
focused solely on serving New Hampshire
 
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
dispensaries in
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
Chichester and miramac um and we support
 
00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
this bill uh my comments will stem more
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
for my involvement uh 10 to 13 years ago
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
is the legislature was debating and
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately passing this law in
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
2013 a lot of the rhetoric surrounding
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
the bill was based on the idea that that
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
if a doctor believes a patient can
 
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
benefit from Cannabis then who is the
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to stand between
 
00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
the doctor and the patient and the law
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
that we ended up passing uh did not give
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
doctors the discretion to determine if
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
if cannabis might be right for a given
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
patient we instead use the system that
 
00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
we created which I'm I'm fine with and I
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
would Echo everything that uh former
 
00:52:23.309 --> 00:52:23.319 align:start position:0%
representative kerk said and and the
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
sponsor said about creating the
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
two-tiered system we're not breaking the
 
00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
thing that's been working for 10 years
 
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
what we would be doing by passing this
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
is simply allowing doctors to be doctors
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
do their jobs if they have a patient who
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have something on the list and
 
00:52:42.789 --> 00:52:42.799 align:start position:0%
they believe it's a unique case it does
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
create a higher threshold they have to
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
attest to their opinion in writing and
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
say that they believe that the benefits
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
would outweigh the risks for the patient
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
so I support the bill as is I think it's
 
00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:55.720 align:start position:0%
great I want to comment brief YY on the
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
rescheduling issues since there were a
 
00:53:00.109 --> 00:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
number of questions about that I've been
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
reading everything that I can find on
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
the prospect of rescheduling of course
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
we don't know whether it will happen or
 
00:53:08.829 --> 00:53:08.839 align:start position:0%
not it it rests with the DEA currently
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
but let's say that it is approved as
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
many of us hope everything that I've
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
read suggests that rescheduling is not
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
going to have any impact on state level
 
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic or quote unquote
 
00:53:26.589 --> 00:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
recreational cannabis regul ation that
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
moving it to schedule 3 would have a
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
number of benefits it would make
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
research somewhat easier it would likely
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
lead to the development of new drugs
 
00:53:36.789 --> 00:53:36.799 align:start position:0%
that would be put through the FDA
 
00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
approval process uh but the FDA is not
 
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
in the business of approving plants and
 
00:53:45.069 --> 00:53:45.079 align:start position:0%
the idea of putting whole plant cannabis
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
through the FDA approval process my
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
understanding is that's very unlikely to
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
ever happen uh so changes will likely
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
occur but it it's not expected to change
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
anything with regard to state level
 
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
programs and as one example I could
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
point out uh Congress passed the farm
 
00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
bill in 2018 legalizing
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
hemp hemp has been federally legal for 5
 
00:54:14.589 --> 00:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
years and there still are no federal
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
regulations for CBD or any other hemp
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
derived cannabinoid we've been waiting 5
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
years and nothing has happened yet so I
 
00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
would agree with the ments that we can't
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
wait for the federal government we have
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
to try to pass the best laws we can to
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
benefit the citizens of New Hampshire
 
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to answer any
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for those
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
comments um when I raised that issue I
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
viewed that this is actually drisking um
 
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire patients um if we do
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
approve this um would you agree that if
 
00:54:52.109 --> 00:54:52.119 align:start position:0%
there are other restrictions because
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
this is being done through doctors and
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's the way that Pharmaceuticals are
 
00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
dealt with that that would drisk the
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
access to these
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
patients and if you can't have a firm
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
answer that's all right yeah no thank
 
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
you for the question I I don't believe
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
there's any risk to patients to begin
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
with so uh you can't drisk zero but
 
00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:14.109 align:start position:0%
with so uh you can't drisk zero but
thank

00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:55:17.069 --> 00:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
you other
 
00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:23.039 align:start position:0%

Hampshire could you push the button for
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%

I have to hold it no no once the right
 
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:42.440 align:start position:0%

you for that uh instruction um yeah I'm
 
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
Heather Stockwell I work at rights and
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
democracy I'm the healthcare organizer
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
I've been doing this work for uh
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
approximately six years now and I talk
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
to people about their health care every
 
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
day um I'm also a patient and the reason
 
00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:02.799 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking here today over other
 
00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:05.559 align:start position:0%
people that work at rights and democracy
 
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:07.640 align:start position:0%
um is that I have the most knowledge
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
about this I too read a lot of Articles
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
and books about cannabis um and I have
 
00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:16.359 align:start position:0%
for longer than six years
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
um I like millions of Americans uh did
 
00:56:23.309 --> 00:56:23.319 align:start position:0%
before this program use uh what is
 
00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
considered Rec recreational
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
um I would use the term adult use I now
 
00:56:32.109 --> 00:56:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
uh I'm gonna I'm going to pause there
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
for a second
 
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm not a medical card holder yet in
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and that's
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
why I'm speaking today because I have
 
00:56:48.029 --> 00:56:48.039 align:start position:0%
faced barriers in getting that card and
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
part of that is really because of the
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
provider side of things because they are
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
so not knowledgeable in fact I go into
 
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
appointments having more knowledge than
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
my own provider on this
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
topic I have
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
many many
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
qualifying conditions I I should be able
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
to get a card some of them are chronic
 
00:57:16.589 --> 00:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
pain conditions but I
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
also um have
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
anxiety uh as well as insomnia these are
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
both things that I could be treated for
 
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
and I really want to talk about the
 
00:57:31.789 --> 00:57:31.799 align:start position:0%
anxiety part because the first line of
 
00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:35.039 align:start position:0%
action really for anxiety from providers
 
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
is to give you what is known as a benzo
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
a benzo dipene I believe it's pronounced
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of evidence that this is a
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
very addictive and quite strong drug and
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
I have chosen not to go that route
 
00:57:53.549 --> 00:57:53.559 align:start position:0%
unless I really feel that I'm incapable
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
of doing something but I can be capable
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
of doing things with the anxiety if I
 
00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:03.559 align:start position:0%
had a cannabis card if it was easier for
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
me to
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
get I really appreciate the fact that
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
this would lower the cost and that the
 
00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:12.839 align:start position:0%
committee has worked to lower those
 
00:58:17.309 --> 00:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
costs making $50 a year now it's $50 for
 
00:58:20.109 --> 00:58:20.119 align:start position:0%
three years that is another barrier to
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
patients the cost of medical cannabis is
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
not cheap
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
and so getting a card and having to
 
00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
having that barrier of another $50 a
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointment maybe several
 
00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointments starts to rack up
 
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
especially when you might also be
 
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
managing other other health issues you
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
might have to have
 
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:45.640 align:start position:0%
surgery right there are there are a lot
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
of costs associated with some of these
 
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
medical conditions and keeping those
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
costs down for patients is certainly uh
 
00:58:56.029 --> 00:58:56.039 align:start position:0%
a big a big
 
00:58:58.510 --> 00:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
concern um could you start wrapping up
 
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
please yes sure I I think that's really
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
that that's really the last point that I
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to make I I personally um in the
 
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
past before we had this law um I I used
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis to quit smoking I see that
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
there are so many positive uses for this
 
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
and if you're looking at things in terms
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
of like harm
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
reduction cannabis is
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
in my opinion less harmful than so many
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
of the other substances that we allow
 
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
doctors to prescribe and it's really
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
time for us to see through some of the
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
nonsense that we have created consider
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
the FDA uh Ru you know scheduling and
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
things like that so I really appreciate
 
00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:45.559 align:start position:0%
uh the time uh that you've taken to hear
 
00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
hear me out here and hear a patient uh
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
side of things and I'd be happy to take
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
any uh questions if anyone has it any
 
00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.470 align:start position:0%
any uh questions if anyone has it any
questions

00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
much no one else has signed up to
 
01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
testify on hb1 1278 FN so I'm going to
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on that bill
 
01:00:11.309 --> 01:00:11.319 align:start position:0%
and open the public hearing on HB
 
01:00:14.029 --> 01:00:14.039 align:start position:0%
1240 uh and recognize the prime sponsor
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
representative Heath
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
Howard also I'd like to point out that
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh all of the Bills should be on the
 
01:00:22.589 --> 01:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
side table but if members of the
 
01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
committee need those or any others uh
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
they can see uh Karen Davis and moom
 
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
2011 and she'll be happy to to frish
 
01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
those representative howood welcome back
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
committee members so the purpose for hb1
 
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
1240 uh is because for me I I somebody
 
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
very close to me uh has dealt with
 
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
anorexia uh and anorexia is one of the
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
deadliest mental or is the deadliest
 
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
mental health disorder uh killing
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
anywhere up to 5% of of anybody who's
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with it and we need to be
 
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
ensuring that anybody who has anorexia
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
is eating it doesn't matter how they get
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
food it's that they get it and the
 
01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
States of Maine California New Mexico
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
North Dakota Illinois Maryland Nevada
 
01:01:13.029 --> 01:01:13.039 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania and Oklahoma all have
 
01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
similar legislation on
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
record and as we've already kind of
 
01:01:21.069 --> 01:01:21.079 align:start position:0%
discussed uh in the recent uh FDA uh
 
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.039 align:start position:0%
report that was released uh we have had
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
seen uh that in their uh findings they
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
had used a study from the University of
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
Florida where in Florida uh there is uh
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
only one exception for uh treating uh
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
anorexia with cannabis and that's for
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
patients uh dealing with cancer uh and I
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
I apologize but there are limited
 
01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:47.079 align:start position:0%
studies on uh the effectiveness of uh
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
cannabis on treating anorexia but they
 
01:01:53.069 --> 01:01:53.079 align:start position:0%
did find that there was moderate success
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
in treating uh anorexia with cannabis uh
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
in this and it was part of the reason
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
why they decided to recommend uh it to
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
three so not only can uh cannabis help
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
provide an appetite for patients dealing
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
with anorexia but anorexia is a mental
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
health disorder and there are a lot of
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot of anxiety that goes
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
along with it and of course we already
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
recognize that cannabis can help people
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
dealing with this uh so it kind of helps
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
people on two fronts so if we can help
 
01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
uh provide cannabis to some of these
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
people and uh help them actually obtain
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
hold food then we can actually help save
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
lives thank you I'm uh open for any
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
questions questions for representative
 
01:02:51.069 --> 01:02:51.079 align:start position:0%
Howard representative
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
Palmer thank you Mr
 
01:02:53.359 --> 01:02:55.069 align:start position:0%
Palmer thank you Mr
J

01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
J
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
I'm too short thank you Mr chair thank
 
01:02:58.750 --> 01:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question I'm just
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
curious about whether Bill 1278 would
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
cover this yes uh so it would I mean I I
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
would prefer uh uh HB 1278 uh over this
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
bill but uh as we know sometimes uh
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
bills can often uh end up being uh shot
 
01:03:20.829 --> 01:03:20.839 align:start position:0%
down and ited uh so it's it's always
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
good to kind of cover our
 
01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
bases representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.559 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
for bringing this to us um we heard
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
before in the previous Bill's hearing
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
that there's the issue of having both
 
01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
the underlying um diagnosis and the
 
01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:38.119 align:start position:0%
symptom would we need to add anything to
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
those symptoms so that these patients
 
01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
can actually get the relief that they
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
need or is that already covered in the
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
symptoms that are
 
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
listed um I that would be best answered
 
01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:50.359 align:start position:0%
by somebody else okay thank you I just
 
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
want to make sure if we do it we do it
 
01:03:54.029 --> 01:03:54.039 align:start position:0%
right yes of course thank you other
 
01:03:58.589 --> 01:03:58.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:01.269 --> 01:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
Shapero thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
you for taking this question and
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
um I'll just say that it's fine if you
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
can't or um don't want to answer this um
 
01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
but but I wonder if you had considered
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
limiting the covered Eating Disorders to
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
anorexia since
 
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
um since some of the other disorders
 
01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.710 align:start position:0%
um since some of the other disorders
include

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
binging um and I wonder if um using
 
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
medicinal cannabis in that case would
 
01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
have a paradoxical and maybe negative
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
effect yeah uh so I I mean I would be
 
01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
open to an amendment uh as as we know
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
the other uh Eating Disorders listed in
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
this bill uh would actually benefit from
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
medicinal cannabis uh but I mean as I
 
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
had mentioned with eating disorders it
 
01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
is a very mental uh it's a very mentally
 
01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
focused uh problem and it's a mental
 
01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
health Disorder so if we if somebody
 
01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
does uh have binge eating disorder they
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
may benefit from it and I think that
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
would be best left the
 
01:05:13.269 --> 01:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
provider thank you other
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:33.549 --> 01:05:33.559 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um you guys
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
are going to be sick of seeing me by the
 
01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
end of today um but that's that's I'm
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
here for a good reason um I'm
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas again from
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
the town of marac and I am in support of
 
01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
this bill I want to give you I'm going
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
to take this off I want to give you um a
 
01:05:53.549 --> 01:05:53.559 align:start position:0%
personal example of how uh cannabis has
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
helped an eating disorder in November of
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
2020 I uh came down with covid um and I
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
developed long covid and so for a year
 
01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
and a half I had no smell I could not
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
smell food I couldn't taste food I had
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
no appetite and no
 
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
thirst um this was called long covid
 
01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
induced anorexia it was not a mental
 
01:06:23.269 --> 01:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
condition but I could not eat food uh
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
there was no desire to eat food and food
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
actually made me feel ill um many of you
 
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
that have served with me before um many
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
of you didn't even recognize me I lost
 
01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
80 pounds um and that was because of
 
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
malnutrition I could not literally could
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
not get the food into my body it
 
01:06:42.829 --> 01:06:42.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't stay in my body I couldn't
 
01:06:42.839 --> 01:06:43.750 align:start position:0%
wouldn't stay in my body I couldn't
absorb

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
absorb
 
01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
it three years out I still have
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
diminished smell taste appetite and
 
01:06:51.309 --> 01:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
thirst but I can override it now and I
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
can force myself to
 
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
eat I went to many dispensaries I went
 
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
to some in Maine I went to some in New
 
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I asked the dis the people
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
who worked in the dispensary what
 
01:07:06.029 --> 01:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
strains help with appetite because those
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
are the people that know the people that
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
work there the people that use this um
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
you know the big sort of joke about
 
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis is you you smoke a joint and
 
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
then you sit on the couch and eat
 
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
Doritos for the rest of the day I looked
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
forward to having Munchies as their coll
 
01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
called um never got Munchies I'm
 
01:07:29.069 --> 01:07:29.079 align:start position:0%
probably the only person in the world
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
that didn't get munchies from from
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
Cannabis however the Diesels and the
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
kushes which are specific strains of
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis that lean towards the
 
01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
indicas they calmed my gut spasms down
 
01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
enough that I could eat food it would
 
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
stay in my body enough that I could I
 
01:07:50.589 --> 01:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
could absorb the nutrition so here is a
 
01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
clear eating disorder that was that was
 
01:07:57.789 --> 01:07:57.799 align:start position:0%
helped with cannabis since since almost
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
a year ago I've gained 15 pounds back
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
and I again I'm probably the only person
 
01:08:05.269 --> 01:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
in the world the only woman in the world
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
who is thrilled about gaining 15
 
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
pounds um so
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
so uh I I believe it was uh
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
representative Leon Eating Disorders are
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
not currently covered um which is why we
 
01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
would need this bill however if you
 
01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
passed the previous bill you would never
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
need to hear another one of these bills
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
again for a specific condition um and as
 
01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
far as the question for binging that's
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
where education comes in if you've got a
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
patient who's binging and they want
 
01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:40.759 align:start position:0%
cannabis for an eating disorder that's
 
01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
probably not an appropriate patient or
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
condition to to prescribe the the order
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
for however along with binging usually
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
comes some kind of anxiety or some kind
 
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
of medical condition so it might be but
 
01:08:55.229 --> 01:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
this is where education for the
 
01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
providers is going to be very very
 
01:08:59.430 --> 01:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
important and must be ongoing if you
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
could please start wrapping up I'm all
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
done thank you I'm open for questions
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
questions oh representative
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
McLean thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um even if
 
01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
1278 were to pass following up on some
 
01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
of the testimony on the previous bill
 
01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
because there are providers that are
 
01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
maybe not current on all the Lit
 
01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:24.269 align:start position:0%
maybe not current on all the Lit
Literature

01:09:24.269 --> 01:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
Literature
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
having this passed into law would still
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
be benefit because it would explicitly
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
state that this is there am I correct I
 
01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
I believe you are correct because if we
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
passed this it would go on to the form
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
and there the the Physicians that are
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
not familiar with cannabis are going to
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
rely on the conditions that are outlined
 
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
on that form so it will give them an
 
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:48.759 align:start position:0%
idea but if you are familiar with
 
01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis you're going to look at the
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
form and you're going to say okay what I
 
01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
want is not listed on this form I'm
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
going to do it this way thank you you're
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you for the question other
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is uh former
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
KARK this time try for the three minutes
 
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
okay yes actually this one timed out at
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
two minutes though I'm going to
 
01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:30.990 align:start position:0%
two minutes though I'm going to
respond

01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
um so again uh I don't have to
 
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
reintroduce myself except say for the
 
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
record Jerry kerk chair of the
 
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
theraputic cannabis medical oversight
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
board um so indeed excuse me hb1 1240
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
does seek to add a broad spectrum of
 
01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
Eating Disorders as a qualifying
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
condition for the therapeutic use of
 
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis tcov voted 6 to1 to not support
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
support this bill as there's not enough
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
evidence to take a position at this time
 
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
the board feels that there may be some
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
Merit and some people may benefit but
 
01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
the literature does not really support
 
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:05.750 align:start position:0%
the literature does not really support
its

01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
its
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
use here's the key thing it's important
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
to understand that Eating Disorders are
 
01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
not simply a lack of appetite they're
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
complex psychiatric disorders often
 
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
requiring multi modal long-term
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
psychiatric therapy and as was alluded
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
to earlier anorexia nervosa can be a
 
01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
disorder and one of the things about
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
sort of the psychiatric part for example
 
01:11:30.189 --> 01:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
part of the disordered behavior of
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
anorexia nervosa is a sense of
 
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
empowerment that comes with resisting
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
hunger and the temptation to eat and so
 
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
treating anorexia nervosa is far more
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
complex than just stimulating appetite
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
cannabis doeses have appetite
 
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
stimulating effects and that's primarily
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
from the TC and we do utilize that and
 
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
to treat patients with diseases or
 
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
treatments such as chemotherapy which
 
01:11:56.629 --> 01:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
can cause a loss of appetite that's
 
01:11:59.310 --> 01:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
already in statute but they're not
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
psychiatric disorders those are a
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
suppression of appetite due to other
 
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
things and what I was looking up quickly
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
here before coming up and we when look
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
at that and piece that we spoke about
 
01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
earlier it's important toe to understand
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
um the there's a catchall which is uh
 
01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
existing here and that is at the end of
 
01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
the conditions is one or more injuries
 
01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
or conditions that has resulted in one
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
or more qualifying symptoms under
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph two in other words if the
 
01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
person has an undefined condition that
 
01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
the provider certifies leads to one of
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
the symptoms in list two and this is
 
01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
what's currently in statute they can
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
qualify and enlist to um is caia and
 
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy induced anorexia and
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
wasting syndrome so for example the
 
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
comments about loss of of appetite
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
secondary to long covid you could
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
qualify by saying you have long covid
 
01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
and as a result you have an appetite
 
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
suppression you could qualify into that
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
now this again is one of the areas
 
01:13:06.629 --> 01:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
though where provider knowledge is
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
really a problem some providers will
 
01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
understand that a lot of people will
 
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
have no clue um so there are some small
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
limited small studies on use of
 
01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis and anorexia
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
nervosa and one of those was quoted
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
earlier but that was one of them there
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
are a handful of studies but the results
 
01:13:25.229 --> 01:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
have been mixed there are also some have
 
01:13:27.229 --> 01:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
shown a small amount of gain like a
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
kilogram of weight over the course of a
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
month that's not trivial but it's uh
 
01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's all and there are also
 
01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
some potential Harms in using cannabis
 
01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
and eating disorders including
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
compensatory disorders of bur purging
 
01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:41.790 align:start position:0%
compensatory disorders of bur purging
and

01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
binging also it's important to
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
understand that in the group that have
 
01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
anorexia nervosa there are relatively
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
High co-occurrence rates of substance
 
01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:52.350 align:start position:0%
High co-occurrence rates of substance
use

01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
disorders there was a result that would
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
suggest that the use of cannabis for an
 
01:13:59.070 --> 01:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
eaan disorder may put patients at an
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
increased risk of cannabis use disorder
 
01:14:03.550 --> 01:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
please start wrapping up if you could
 
01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
yes I I I maxed down to two oh actually
 
01:14:10.189 --> 01:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
a comment earlier um comment about the
 
01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
Standalone aspect the the the question
 
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
was asked about symptoms and conditions
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
that will not apply because this is put
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
in as a standalone condition and
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
therefore it does not fall into that
 
01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
rubric of needing condition and symptom
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
so basically until better data is
 
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
available TCM o does not support the use
 
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
of cannabis to treat Eating Disorders so
 
01:14:31.149 --> 01:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
we would urge pass going with itl on
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
this bill rather than passing it thank
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
you any questions any any questions for
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative K representative King
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
Seth King thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
you doctor for taking questions um you
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
supported um HB
 
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
1278 and we've also heard from other
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
testifiers on this bill that if 1278 is
 
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
passed this bill becomes sort of moot
 
01:14:58.830 --> 01:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
because these conditions will be covered
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
in 1278 how do you square the fact that
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
you're for 1278 but not for this bill
 
01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
even though this bill is sort of
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
encompassed by 1278 thank you well this
 
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
would put it in not as a provider
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
discretion thing but simply as a
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
statutory approved Standalone condition
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
so therefore the person who does not
 
01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
have much knowledge and says I'm not
 
01:15:24.189 --> 01:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
really sure but I'm looking at this and
 
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
it says that it's okay to do it for
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
anorexia nervosa they would be able to
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
do it if this
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
passes if this does not pass but 1278
 
01:15:35.709 --> 01:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
passes they could not do that but the
 
01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
person who says I know a lot about this
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
I actually treat Eating Disorders I'm a
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist I that's a key thing they
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
would know a lot about this and I think
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
in your case it might be worth a trial
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
then they could certify so that adds
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
that again higher level of Provider
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
discretion in the person I mean we got
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
providers really need to have a certain
 
01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
element of responsibility that they know
 
01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
what they know and they know what they
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
don't know again would I as a spine doc
 
01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
prescrib this no for this disorder no
 
01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
but if I were a psychiatrist and I
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
already treated that patient I have an
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
established relationship and I think it
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
might be worth a try they could do that
 
01:16:14.669 --> 01:16:14.679 align:start position:0%
under 1278 but they could not do it uh
 
01:16:16.629 --> 01:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
as it is
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you okay thank
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
Hannon good morning good morning uh
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Joe Hannon and I'm
 
01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill uh I didn't
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
speak on the previous bill but since
 
01:16:45.629 --> 01:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
it's come up uh during testimony for
 
01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
this I'd like to say that I I do believe
 
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
that things should be left at the
 
01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
discretion of uh people that are
 
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
Physicians and prescribers uh the
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
previous uh doctor was a spine surgeon I
 
01:16:57.149 --> 01:16:57.159 align:start position:0%
was a foot and ankle surgeon uh neither
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
of us would be generally would prescribe
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
something for anorexia nervosa or other
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
Related Disorders however uh I do
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
believe that uh even though when I was
 
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
in the legislature I voted on a lot of
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
these things uh I didn't feel even as um
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
an elected representative that it was my
 
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say duty but I I didn't feel
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
just because I was elected I knew better
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
and just because I'm a doctor doesn't
 
01:17:21.629 --> 01:17:21.639 align:start position:0%
mean that I necessarily know better for
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
everybody or other doctors in patients I
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
do think it should be left up to the
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
individual Physicians and prescribers
 
01:17:29.629 --> 01:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
and the uh the potential patients there
 
01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
are uh definitely uh studies out there
 
01:17:34.709 --> 01:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
that show that there's some evidence um
 
01:17:36.629 --> 01:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
for lots of different conditions
 
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
recently the FDA we heard about their
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
rescheduling recommendation uh to be a
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
schedule three um they they've indicated
 
01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
there's a there's uh credible scientific
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
data to support uh to substantiate the
 
01:17:49.709 --> 01:17:49.719 align:start position:0%
use of marijuana the treatment of pain
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
Anor anorexia related to certain medical
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
conditions and nausea invol vomiting uh
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
such as chemo-induced um vomiting with
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
varying degrees of support and
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
consistency of findings so they did find
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
evidence and in their review also none
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
of the they also said none of the
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
evidence from the systematic reviews
 
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
included in their analysis identified
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
any safety concerns that would preclude
 
01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
the use of marijuana in the indications
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
for which there exists some credible
 
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
scientific support for its therapeutic
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
benefit so um as talk about uh these are
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
not people that are trying necessarily
 
01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
have an agenda these are FDA scientists
 
01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
who were told what do you think and this
 
01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
is what they came up with with review of
 
01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
uh some of the literature uh you know
 
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
we've heard this quote uh the founder of
 
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
mod day tox of Toxicology phys Swiss
 
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
physician named paracelsus heard this
 
01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
quote yesterday so I thought I'd bring
 
01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
it back up again today um the dose makes
 
01:18:41.709 --> 01:18:41.719 align:start position:0%
the poison everyone wants to know well
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
how much do you give uh what what is an
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
effective therapeutic dose uh if a child
 
01:18:48.629 --> 01:18:48.639 align:start position:0%
has attention deficit disorder they get
 
01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
riddle in say 10 milligrams three times
 
01:18:53.149 --> 01:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
a day that may be the appropriate dose
 
01:18:54.669 --> 01:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
and that'll calm that child down even
 
01:18:56.189 --> 01:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
though it's a stimulant drug if you give
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
it to someone an adult they might get
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
the J get jittery or get anxious so it
 
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
depends on the patient depends on the
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
individual and depends on the condition
 
01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
if you give that same child instead of
 
01:19:08.669 --> 01:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
10 you give them 100 milligrams you're
 
01:19:09.790 --> 01:19:09.800 align:start position:0%
going to notice a difference in their
 
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
behavior and it's not going to be calm
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
it would probably make anybody a little
 
01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
more uh agitated to say the least and
 
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
anxious so everything is um potentially
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
a poison everything water cannabis
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh you name the the substance it could
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
probably kill you in the right dose the
 
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
fact is uh we can't legislate what
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
someone should take for attention
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
deficit for diabetes if the legislature
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
came uh in session and said we're going
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
to determine how much insulin you need
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
to be a diabetic and this is the chart
 
01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
that's been approved and if you deviate
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
from that you know we'd kill a lot of
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
people um so I think it's really
 
01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
important to leave this to the people
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
that uh that have gone to school have
 
01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
gotten a DEA license and these people
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
write prescriptions for much stronger
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
and more dangerous uh therapies than
 
01:19:59.790 --> 01:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
this uh and I do believe I agree with my
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
colleague that uh you know not it's
 
01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
important the prescriber knows what they
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
know and knows what they don't know and
 
01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
I've never uh when I was prescribing I
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
never looked at uh the law to say oh
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's how I should do this uh not once
 
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
never looked it up and I'm bit of a wonk
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
when it comes to policy so uh thank you
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
Dr yeah thank you uh are you taking
 
01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
questions if you have any any questions
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%

Sullivan District 8 I serve on Ed
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
committee which is where I was and
 
01:21:08.669 --> 01:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
chairman lad reprimands us for
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
permission I mean for punctuation all
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
the time I'm here to support this bill I
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
spent my career as a dietitian probably
 
01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
50% of my patients were people with
 
01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:19.870 align:start position:0%
50% of my patients were people with
eating

01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
eating
 
01:21:22.189 --> 01:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
disorders over the course of 40s
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
something years in that work I developed
 
01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
relationships with many patients from
 
01:21:29.229 --> 01:21:29.239 align:start position:0%
seeing them for an extended period of
 
01:21:32.189 --> 01:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
time as you do with folks with eating
 
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
disorders and it became apparent in
 
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
many uh
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
cases that some folks considerably
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
benefited from being able to use
 
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
marijuana um it was not something that I
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
as a practitioner ever initiated
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
discussion about um most of the time
 
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
that I was in practice medical marijuana
 
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't legal in New Hampshire um but
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
when it would come up in therapy and
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
discussions and a patient would
 
01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
describe how much more able they were to
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
manage their eating disorder
 
01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
behaviors it's pretty hard to ignore
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
that benefit I think these patients
 
01:22:20.189 --> 01:22:20.199 align:start position:0%
deserve to legally obtain what is
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
helpful to them use in a wise and
 
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
thoughtful way and I fully support this
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
bill as I was thinking about testifying
 
01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
on this there were two
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
particular patients that came to
 
01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
mind one was an anorexic man he was
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
probably about 40 if memory serves me
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
correctly a very
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
smart very engaged
 
01:22:47.709 --> 01:22:47.719 align:start position:0%
person I won't speak to his profession
 
01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
to be sure I respect
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
confidentiality um but his Capac
 
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
capacity intellectually
 
01:22:58.189 --> 01:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
was um very
 
01:23:02.590 --> 01:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
high and he was dying he was totally
 
01:23:07.709 --> 01:23:07.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:12.189 --> 01:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
adequately he refused Residential
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
Treatment um his parents tried to get
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
guardianship of him they did not
 
01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
succeed it was really the stuff that
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
keeps you awake at night his treatment
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
team how were we going to help
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
him and another member of the team
 
01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
suggested that he try
 
01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana and that man is alive today I
 
01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
wish he was here to testify and if you
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
met him on the street you would have no
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
reason to surmise the ordeal that he
 
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
went through to get
 
01:23:47.629 --> 01:23:47.639 align:start position:0%
well it really was an extraordinary
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
turnaround I'm not suggesting that
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
marijuana would do that for all people
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
by with eating disorders by any means
 
01:23:58.750 --> 01:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
but it was really a life-saving measure
 
01:23:58.760 --> 01:23:59.910 align:start position:0%
but it was really a life-saving measure
for

01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
him the other case that came to mind
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
particularly much less dramatic but also
 
01:24:09.149 --> 01:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
very valuable college student young
 
01:24:11.790 --> 01:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
woman um binge eating disorder that
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
became bulimia so she was making herself
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
sick many times a
 
01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
day beyond the medical issues of that it
 
01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
was completely distracting from her
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
well-being and her ability to be a
 
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
capable college
 
01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
student and similarly obviously lots of
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
college students um smoke marijuana or
 
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
uh utilize it in some other way uh
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
certainly um suffice to say that that in
 
01:24:41.790 --> 01:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
fact was also a solution for her so I
 
01:24:45.229 --> 01:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my remarks and I
 
01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
representative for sneaking away from
 
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:54.639 align:start position:0%
education to testify on this I
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate it uh my question would be we
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
had another bill about allowing um
 
01:25:01.109 --> 01:25:01.119 align:start position:0%
doctors to have more latitude and people
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
21 and older um do you see this as
 
01:25:05.709 --> 01:25:05.719 align:start position:0%
necessary to go into the statute
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
separately so that teenagers and others
 
01:25:10.629 --> 01:25:10.639 align:start position:0%
who are under that age have the ability
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
to access this um because I know a lot
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
of teenagers do reach do have serious
 
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
life life-threatening issues around
 
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
anorexia thank you for the excellent
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
question and the answer is yes
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
um specifically because as you noted
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
there is such a high incidence of Eating
 
01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:29.719 align:start position:0%
Disorders in teens and we know that with
 
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
eating disorders the sooner that you
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
effectively treat it the less likelihood
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
that it becomes a lifetime
 
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
condition and if we are not as effective
 
01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
at early
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
treatment the long range is um much
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
harder to manage and the Vitality rate
 
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
anorexia is the psychiatric diagnosis
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
with the highest fatality rate of any
 
01:25:57.070 --> 01:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
want thank you Mr chair and thank you if
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
I could have just two questions because
 
01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
that just so with respect to the prior
 
01:26:06.109 --> 01:26:06.119 align:start position:0%
legislation which I don't know if you
 
01:26:09.229 --> 01:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
were here for and the 21 year age
 
01:26:12.149 --> 01:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
restriction I was not yeah so but based
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
on your experience as a
 
01:26:17.310 --> 01:26:17.320 align:start position:0%
dietitian um you would possibly
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
recommend going back to amend that to
 
01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
allow people that are younger um with
 
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
maybe a second opinion to do that so
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
that you could intervene at an earlier
 
01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
period with the caveat that I have not
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
read that legislation so I want to be
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
careful that I don't speak without being
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
informed what you're saying sounds to me
 
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
like it makes sense that a person who is
 
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
15 or 16 with a restrictive eating
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
disorder or binge eating disorder could
 
01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
benefit and I uh appreciate your
 
01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
suggestion of you'd have two providers
 
01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
weighing in on that that makes
 
01:26:58.990 --> 01:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
sense and and then then and my second
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
question is not related to that but um
 
01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
the TCM o did not come out in support of
 
01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
this because they talked about the
 
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
literature is not comprehensive enough
 
01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
or or um it's it's not it it really
 
01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't put a stake in the sand per to
 
01:27:19.709 --> 01:27:19.719 align:start position:0%
say um is there anything you know from
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
your experience as a dietitian and and
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
your exposure to maybe literature that
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
they may not have seen that may kind of
 
01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
counter that um because you're talking
 
01:27:32.109 --> 01:27:32.119 align:start position:0%
specifically about anorexia and bulimia
 
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
which there is a certain amount of
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
what's the word I'm not a doctor mental
 
01:27:41.310 --> 01:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
aspects to it um so are you aware of
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
anything that might kind of counter uh
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
those prior comments or or add to
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
that I have been retired for a year
 
01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
retired in December 22
 
01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
um so I haven't kept up in this past
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
year something about being a rep on
 
01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
education and housing committee
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know if there was newer um
 
01:28:12.270 --> 01:28:12.280 align:start position:0%
research prior to that I would say it
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
was limited and very small case
 
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
populations it's much more anecdotal and
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
I would say talked about a lot in the
 
01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
eating disorder Treatment
 
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
Community uh I don't know who else
 
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
you've heard
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
testify of other professionals and
 
01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
eating disorders but I can certainly
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
reach out to some folks and ask them to
 
01:28:35.430 --> 01:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
provide some input to the committee um
 
01:28:38.990 --> 01:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
you know post hearing
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
um Eating Disorders are not a topic that
 
01:28:47.149 --> 01:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
attract a substantial amount of research
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
money and so it has been a very long
 
01:28:53.709 --> 01:28:53.719 align:start position:0%
slow process as in my opinion not only
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
related to marijuana just in general how
 
01:28:58.750 --> 01:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you very much for your
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:30.310 align:start position:0%
 
day

01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh committee
 
01:29:34.590 --> 01:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
members for having me back yet again all
 
01:29:39.109 --> 01:29:39.119 align:start position:0%
right so as we've already oh I'll hold
 
01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
up as we've uh already discussed uh with
 
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
regards to uh medicinal cannabis uh it
 
01:29:50.189 --> 01:29:50.199 align:start position:0%
does a good job of helping people with
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
anxiety and we know that because of how
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
we already prescribe it for people
 
01:29:57.310 --> 01:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
suffering from PTSD uh which is defined
 
01:29:59.229 --> 01:29:59.239 align:start position:0%
as an anxiety disorder caused by
 
01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
or and we we do prescribe other
 
01:30:09.709 --> 01:30:09.719 align:start position:0%
medications to handle anxiety like Xanax
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh which is a
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
benzodiazepine uh and we know that benzo
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
zeppin have been involved in
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
12,500 deaths in 2021 alone and that's
 
01:30:25.950 --> 01:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
from the National Institutes of
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
Health the states of Delaware Nevada New
 
01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
Jersey New Mexico North Dakota Oklahoma
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
Penn and Pennsylvania all have uh
 
01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
anxiety as a qualifying condition and or
 
01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:37.790 align:start position:0%
anxiety as a qualifying condition and or
similar

01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
similar
 
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
legislation and as I have already
 
01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh with some of the previous
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
bills uh I I do genuinely think that
 
01:30:50.709 --> 01:30:50.719 align:start position:0%
cannabis as a treatment for anxiety is
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
something that would be beneficial to a
 
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
number of people it's not going to be
 
01:30:55.629 --> 01:30:55.639 align:start position:0%
the solution for everyone just like
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
certain uh benzo zines will not
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily be the solution for others
 
01:31:04.189 --> 01:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
but there is a Le there's significantly
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
less risk of Overdose as we know because
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
nobody's overdosed on marijuana uh and
 
01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
alone I should say and it can be
 
01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
beneficial for that regard alone we know
 
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
that there are different ways that and
 
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
triggers that people have for anxiety
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
and it's important that we try to
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
approach uh their issues from a patient
 
01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
level and let providers decide uh what
 
01:31:31.629 --> 01:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
is best for them and providing this as a
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
qualifying condition will give uh
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
providers that opportunity to assess
 
01:31:41.709 --> 01:31:41.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
taking my qu question this is actually
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
an observation we in the state of New
 
01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we don't prescribe cannabis we
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
certify PE
 
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
the individual as a condition and then
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
based on that the Cannabis commission
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
okays or HHS okays it I apologize for uh
 
01:32:04.189 --> 01:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
using the wrong terminology person to
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
answer this but I'd like to know if
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
there are any data on cannabis um in
 
01:32:14.189 --> 01:32:14.199 align:start position:0%
people in adolescence um because the
 
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
first bill that we have um the first
 
01:32:18.189 --> 01:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
bill that we have would already address
 
01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
it for those who are 21 and older and
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know if there's any data in
 
01:32:24.189 --> 01:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
this younger age group for anxiety and
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh unfortunately I'm not the
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
person to really answer that but as as
 
01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
I've already stated uh hb12 uh 78 would
 
01:32:34.189 --> 01:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
have uh addressed the uh language of
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.639 --> 01:32:57.629 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:32:57.629 --> 01:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
sorry but apparently she knew she
 
01:33:01.149 --> 01:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
apparently I'm talking a lot enough
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas please come
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
forward oh she was just saying my
 
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
microphone was off oh oh okay all right
 
01:33:10.030 --> 01:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
your microphone is on so you're all set
 
01:33:12.270 --> 01:33:12.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas from the town of marac um I
 
01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
used to work at a dispensary uh a
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis dispensary in New Hampshire and
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
the two MA major major uh symptoms that
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
were helped by cannabis were uh insomnia
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
and anxiety you cannot heal if you
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
cannot sleep and you cannot heal if you
 
01:33:37.629 --> 01:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
can't C down now not all anxiety is
 
01:33:42.270 --> 01:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
created equal I am not an anxious person
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
however I should qualify that I was not
 
01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
an anxious person a cancer diagnosis
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
changed that after 2 years of dealing
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
with long covid and and all of the
 
01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
issues with that I was diagnosed with
 
01:33:58.590 --> 01:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
cancer the cancer concerns kicked off
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
anxiety that revolved around my family
 
01:34:05.109 --> 01:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
my kids Financial concerns continued
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
pain relapse and who will love my dog
 
01:34:11.310 --> 01:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
like me if I
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
die uh this is called this is
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
situational anxxiety it is not because
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
of an event although the one could say
 
01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
that a cancer diagnosis is an event but
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's considered normal anxiety when I
 
01:34:26.910 --> 01:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
would talk to a physician about it they
 
01:34:28.510 --> 01:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
would say of course you're you you're
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
anxious about cancer that's normal and
 
01:34:33.790 --> 01:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
So based on that I would not be
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
qualified for the the therapeutic
 
01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis program um because of my quote
 
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
normal anxiety over
 
01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
cancer um cannabis which I do use for
 
01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
this anxiety allows me to back off the
 
01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
cliff it allows me to stop thinking all
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
of these horrible catastrophic thoughts
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
and it allows the anxiety to be quiet
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
enough to allow me to sleep and as I
 
01:35:03.149 --> 01:35:03.159 align:start position:0%
said before once you can start sleeping
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
you can start
 
01:35:07.149 --> 01:35:07.159 align:start position:0%
healing so cannabis allows me to keep my
 
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
anxiety at B at Bay and in therapeutic
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
doses I've heard from so many patients
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
that that have found that uh therapeutic
 
01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
canabus also allows them to keep their
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
anxiety at Bay I'll take any questions
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:24.910 --> 01:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
much also signed up to speak is former
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:54.510 align:start position:0%
 
kerk

01:35:54.510 --> 01:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
so once again Jerry kerk chair of the
 
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
board um so yes uh 1349 does seek to add
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
generalized anxiety disorder to the list
 
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
of conditions and TCA may be voted 7 to
 
01:36:11.790 --> 01:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
one to support this bill as it is
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
written anxiety disorder is a
 
01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
complicated disorder and often treated
 
01:36:17.550 --> 01:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
with an integrated program of multiple
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
modalities including counseling and
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
cognitive behavioral therapy exercise
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
medications but we know that medications
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
do have some really significant side
 
01:36:27.709 --> 01:36:27.719 align:start position:0%
effects and those were commented on
 
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
earlier um even the use of FDA approved
 
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
medications for anxiety generally are
 
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
for uh short-term interventions and not
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
good long-term interventions anecdotally
 
01:36:41.070 --> 01:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis has a lot of evidence about
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
relieving anxiety it was commented
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
earlier that a lot of patients do that
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
in our patient survey anxiety was listed
 
01:36:49.629 --> 01:36:49.639 align:start position:0%
by many of our patients as the symptom
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
for which they really use their
 
01:36:53.470 --> 01:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis now there have been
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
some studies and the Studies have shown
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
that particularly the CBD alone can help
 
01:36:59.950 --> 01:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
with social anxiety that's like public
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
speaking um but the and that can occur
 
01:37:04.990 --> 01:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
that can help without changes in
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
cognition or sedation which is good lowd
 
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
do THC or a combination of low THC and
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
CBD can reduce anxiety without producing
 
01:37:16.189 --> 01:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
significant side effects so that's
 
01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:18.159 align:start position:0%
pretty good but we have to keep in mind
 
01:37:21.310 --> 01:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
that THC and higher doses can signif
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
iFly worsen or actually denovo cause
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
anxiety and increase the risk of
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis use disorder so cannabis does
 
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
need to be used cautiously preferably
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
avoiding high
 
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
THC CCM feels that cannabis is
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
acceptable to use to treat anxiety
 
01:37:39.149 --> 01:37:39.159 align:start position:0%
especially as part of an integrated
 
01:37:41.470 --> 01:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
program the standard approach that the
 
01:37:45.589 --> 01:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
ATC follows will they would they already
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
follow this if they're taking care of
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
somebody with anxiety and they follow
 
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
this generally but they would
 
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
particularly do it here they would keep
 
01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
the THC concentration low they would
 
01:37:57.229 --> 01:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
start at an overall low dose and slowly
 
01:37:59.229 --> 01:37:59.239 align:start position:0%
titrate the dosage to get to the desired
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
effect without The Unwanted side effect
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
of intoxication or
 
01:38:07.589 --> 01:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
Euphoria now another good reason to pass
 
01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
this bill is that currently as commented
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
earlier many people treat their anxiety
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
using cannabis which is purchased on the
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
unregulated recreational Cannabis Market
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
the use of unregulated and unlabeled
 
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis introduces the rich risk of a
 
01:38:25.229 --> 01:38:25.239 align:start position:0%
patient getting high THC cannabis which
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
as I just commented can actually cause
 
01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:28.750 align:start position:0%
as I just commented can actually cause
more

01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
anxiety so therefore it'll be far safer
 
01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
for these people to be certified to use
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis in order to be able
 
01:38:39.189 --> 01:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
to access tested labeled
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
contaminant-free cannabis under the
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
guidance of an ATC basically it's a harm
 
01:38:46.990 --> 01:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
reduction maneuver as well so we do urge
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
passage of 1349 I'll take any questions
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
 
01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
01:38:56.589 --> 01:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I just wondered if
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
you could um address the question that
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
was asked earlier because I know the
 
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis board has a
 
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
statement on cannabis use under the age
 
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:05.669 align:start position:0%
statement on cannabis use under the age
of

01:39:05.669 --> 01:39:05.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:39:08.189 --> 01:39:08.199 align:start position:0%
25 could you comment on that relative to
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
this population yeah basically here's
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
the issue U cannabis has two times in
 
01:39:17.070 --> 01:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
life that it is really problematic and
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
that is in the uterus and during
 
01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
adolescence and the reason is we are
 
01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
having an enormous amount of change in
 
01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
our neurologic system and cannabis
 
01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
interferes with the pring of synaptic
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
connections within the brain and
 
01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
developing new ones as a result um use
 
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
of cannabis during pregnancy or in
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
adolescence can cause significant risks
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
risks such as psychiatric disorders and
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
psychosis and schizophrenia um learning
 
01:39:49.229 --> 01:39:49.239 align:start position:0%
disorders can interfere with the ability
 
01:39:52.030 --> 01:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
of people to concentrate and learn and
 
01:39:55.109 --> 01:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
that can be long lasting not just during
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
the time of use because you're changing
 
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
the neurologic system so as a result we
 
01:40:03.229 --> 01:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
I mean we already we battled for months
 
01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
about whether or not to still allow uh
 
01:40:10.589 --> 01:40:10.599 align:start position:0%
kids to use uh cannabis for epilepsy and
 
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
we only have three on the program so you
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
know we really take this seriously and
 
01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
we we are very cautious about it because
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
these risks are significant in kids and
 
01:40:22.030 --> 01:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
we think that there may be an occasional
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
child where it could be beneficial like
 
01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
for example uncontrolled seizure
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
disorder still May benefit uh because
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty problematic issue for
 
01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
the parent and the child both but in
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
kids that is that answered well enough
 
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
you know as much about this as I
 
01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
do other
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:49.910 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
thank

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.790 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
Hannon long time no see thank you Mr
 
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
chairman uh Joe Hannon again and I'm in
 
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
favor of uh House Bill
 
01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:11.149 align:start position:0%
favor of uh House Bill
1349

01:41:11.149 --> 01:41:11.159 align:start position:0%
1349
 
01:41:13.589 --> 01:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
um there are there are many reasons why
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
I think this needs to be approved um for
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
one uh this has been done in a few other
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
states specifically the most recent
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
state was Pennsylvania in 2019 added
 
01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
this to the list it created a lot of
 
01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
controversy in the media because you
 
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
know the media takes things that happen
 
01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
in politics and Science and makes
 
01:41:33.149 --> 01:41:33.159 align:start position:0%
headlines but uh the people that looked
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
at this there was at the Drex University
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
they have a um medical cannabis Research
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
Center and in April of last year they
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
they it wasn't a published report but
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
they did their little review of the
 
01:41:46.589 --> 01:41:46.599 align:start position:0%
recent literature on um and things about
 
01:41:49.310 --> 01:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh anxiety and cannabis use um little
 
01:41:50.830 --> 01:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
background they they they found it about
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
31% of the population has anxiety
 
01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
disorders uh but less than half of them
 
01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
ever seek any treatment uh one of the
 
01:41:59.070 --> 01:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
most common treatments that people do
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
get is is cannabis usually at adult
 
01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
recreational or elicit uh sources um to
 
01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
treat the reasons why they looked at why
 
01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
people want to use cannabis instead of
 
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
other um Pharm Pharmaceuticals or not no
 
01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:13.639 align:start position:0%
treatment at all which is what most
 
01:42:16.510 --> 01:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
people wind up doing uh the stigma with
 
01:42:19.109 --> 01:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
anxiety disorders uh the bureaucracy in
 
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
the red tape of going through the
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
insurance process prior approval getting
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
treatment all kinds of things the costs
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh even with prescription drugs that are
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
covered by insurance it's often uh not
 
01:42:31.709 --> 01:42:31.719 align:start position:0%
very uh inexpensive to say the least uh
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
the side effects of a lot of medications
 
01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
for anxiety and other psychiatric
 
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
disorders uh not everyone appreciates
 
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
some of the side effects um you know I'm
 
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
not going to list them all but uh they
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
can be U more than annoying to say the
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
least for some patients um as as you
 
01:42:50.189 --> 01:42:50.199 align:start position:0%
heard previously uh they looked at uh
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
what dose does and we talked about this
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
before what doses are important lower
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
doses have been shown in a lot of the
 
01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
research that they looked at to be to be
 
01:42:59.430 --> 01:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
effective and helpful for people with
 
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
anxiety disorders uh as uh and CBD the
 
01:43:05.589 --> 01:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
non psychoactive part of uh the can
 
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
cannaboid is is effective in all doses
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
however we did hear that high doses can
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
lead to anxiety and other problems that
 
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that cannabis can't be used
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
for anxiety you need the right dose and
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's important these patients go
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
through the medical system and it's very
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
that's why I think it's imperative that
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
this needs to go in even if we don't do
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
past the everything bill or let the
 
01:43:27.629 --> 01:43:27.639 align:start position:0%
doctors decide kind of versions this is
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
important it'll increase uh the numbers
 
01:43:32.030 --> 01:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
of patients to qualify and it'll take
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
them out of the shadows and actually get
 
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
them into some form of treatment now no
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
drug by itself is a treatment for um
 
01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
everything or you know um any kind of
 
01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
anxiety so you don't always do one thing
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
for diabetics we don't just say here's
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
your insulin that's all you get we talk
 
01:43:47.709 --> 01:43:47.719 align:start position:0%
about diet we talk about nutrition
 
01:43:49.870 --> 01:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
exercise for diabetes uh the same thing
 
01:43:51.550 --> 01:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
with uh psychiatric disorders especially
 
01:43:54.430 --> 01:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
anxiety there are other things U other
 
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
talk therapy that may be helpful also in
 
01:43:57.790 --> 01:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
conjunction with Pharmaceuticals but
 
01:43:59.229 --> 01:43:59.239 align:start position:0%
when we give someone prac we don't say
 
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
here's your Prozac good luck I mean some
 
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
people do but you need to have other
 
01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
modalities but this is a great start um
 
01:44:08.589 --> 01:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
last thing I'll leave with is um you
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
know when I was uh doing surgeries I
 
01:44:12.390 --> 01:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
would always prescribe one sleeping pill
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
just one for the told the patient take
 
01:44:18.189 --> 01:44:18.199 align:start position:0%
this tonight and I almost never got
 
01:44:19.950 --> 01:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
called for complaints the patient slept
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
through the first night and that's the
 
01:44:22.030 --> 01:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
worst night if you ever had any
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
procedure minor procedure usually the
 
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
first night is the worst you don't sleep
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
you're anxious all pain and anxiety is
 
01:44:30.589 --> 01:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
worse at night I give them one pill and
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
my anxiety greatly increased I greatly
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
decreased I was able to sleep and I was
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
able to enjoy my Saturdays because I
 
01:44:38.910 --> 01:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
usually do these on uh Thursdays or
 
01:44:40.589 --> 01:44:40.599 align:start position:0%
Fridays so I think it's very important
 
01:44:43.229 --> 01:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
not just for the patients uh anxiety and
 
01:44:44.830 --> 01:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
and well-being but also the Physicians
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
and the prescribers okay thank you any
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
questions reprentative Lon um thank you
 
01:44:53.950 --> 01:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
Doctor The Honorable doctor for coming
 
01:44:58.510 --> 01:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
in doing this um my question would be
 
01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
are there people that self-medicate with
 
01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
alcohol for anxiety and how does the
 
01:45:05.229 --> 01:45:05.239 align:start position:0%
harm of that compare to somebody going
 
01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
through the therapeutic program and
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
having lowd dose THC through an ATC
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
great question uh I'm I'm someone who's
 
01:45:15.149 --> 01:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
been in recovery uh alcohol was my my
 
01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:17.320 align:start position:0%
favorite I guess you could say uh it's
 
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
been it's been quite a while since 91
 
01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
um and I never took lowd dose alcohol
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
that didn't exist I mean it probably did
 
01:45:28.870 --> 01:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
I just didn't see it in the stores um
 
01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:32.719 align:start position:0%
but uh you know as far as um alcohol
 
01:45:35.310 --> 01:45:35.320 align:start position:0%
being used to treat uh a disorder I
 
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
think in someone who's had a lot of
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
experience in the recovery community and
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
working with substance use for for many
 
01:45:42.669 --> 01:45:42.679 align:start position:0%
years I I think it's safe to say that
 
01:45:45.070 --> 01:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
the drugs aren't always the problem it's
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh the drugs are a symptom they're
 
01:45:48.510 --> 01:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
something that people self-prescribe to
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
treat with their with their feeling um
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
and I think it's very important that uh
 
01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
just because something can be harmful
 
01:45:57.709 --> 01:45:57.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that it also can't be
 
01:46:00.669 --> 01:46:00.679 align:start position:0%
helpful um you know alcohol actually had
 
01:46:02.350 --> 01:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
medical prescriptions during alcohol
 
01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
prohibition I was show the former head
 
01:46:06.030 --> 01:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
of enforcement for the uh commission
 
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
years ago showed me a picture of one of
 
01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
his prescription pads or picture of his
 
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
prescription for alcohol for the State
 
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire for medical purposes uh
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
I think Winston Churchill got one when
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
he hurt his back in the United States
 
01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
during a Car Act he was hit by a driver
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
in New York City and he had to get a
 
01:46:22.189 --> 01:46:22.199 align:start position:0%
prescription for his uh medical
 
01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
condition so he was able to drink while
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the United States during prohibition
 
01:46:27.790 --> 01:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that was the ideal
 
01:46:29.709 --> 01:46:29.719 align:start position:0%
treatment at the time alcohol but it was
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know better than going through the
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh the DTs uh but I think it's very
 
01:46:37.149 --> 01:46:37.159 align:start position:0%
important to allow the the the people
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
that know what they're doing to at least
 
01:46:40.990 --> 01:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
say this is an option and that it's okay
 
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
I think like I first said the stigma
 
01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
associated with a lot of mental
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
conditions and and psychiatric
 
01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
conditions and and addiction and other
 
01:46:50.910 --> 01:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
um substance use problems
 
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
is one of the biggest reasons why people
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
don't seek treatment and try to
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
self-medicate this kind of takes it out
 
01:46:59.149 --> 01:46:59.159 align:start position:0%
of the Shadows um this says hey it is
 
01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
something that can be used but we want
 
01:47:01.589 --> 01:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
you to talk to someone at a medical
 
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
dispensary and try and get some
 
01:47:05.310 --> 01:47:05.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge and some uh education if
 
01:47:06.669 --> 01:47:06.679 align:start position:0%
someone came in I've never been a bud
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
tender I don't work in a in a cannabis
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
shop but if someone came in and said
 
01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
what should I do uh from my limited
 
01:47:14.189 --> 01:47:14.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge I would say from the studies
 
01:47:16.109 --> 01:47:16.119 align:start position:0%
that this place I would say you want low
 
01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
dose and they always say start small and
 
01:47:21.629 --> 01:47:21.639 align:start position:0%
you know start low and work your way up
 
01:47:23.310 --> 01:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
uh I've visited some dispensaries and
 
01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
had tours and I've never heard anyone
 
01:47:26.589 --> 01:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
say you know oh yeah we tell people take
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
the take the big one big gummy bear take
 
01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
the big joint that's not what they they
 
01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
talk about even in the recreational
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
adult use places they they tell you you
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
know if you're new start slow and it's
 
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
the same thing with medicine if someone
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
has a a medical condition you know we
 
01:47:42.510 --> 01:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
don't usually give them the highest dose
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
available for something we try to give
 
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
this everything in medicine is you want
 
01:47:47.709 --> 01:47:47.719 align:start position:0%
the lowest you want the safest
 
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
acceptable dose that produces the most
 
01:47:52.589 --> 01:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
benefits with the least amount of um
 
01:47:54.910 --> 01:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
harmful side effects and I think this is
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
one of those things that we know from
 
01:47:58.589 --> 01:47:58.599 align:start position:0%
The Limited studies and I say limited
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
because the federal prohibition Federal
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
prohibition has uh kept us from studying
 
01:48:04.589 --> 01:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
this to a really serious degree but
 
01:48:05.790 --> 01:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
there are there are enough studies out
 
01:48:07.709 --> 01:48:07.719 align:start position:0%
there to show that it does work in low
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
doses for for many people not saying
 
01:48:11.149 --> 01:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
this works for everyone I'm not saying
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
this if you have anxiety you should go
 
01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
out and start you know using cannabis
 
01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
but I think you should talk to your
 
01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
provider talk to your your PCP your PR
 
01:48:19.589 --> 01:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
Primary Care doc your mental health
 
01:48:21.709 --> 01:48:21.719 align:start position:0%
provider and at least start the
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
conversation and if that conversation
 
01:48:24.990 --> 01:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
goes further at least this would allow
 
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity to treat themselves
 
01:48:29.709 --> 01:48:29.719 align:start position:0%
legally and as far as Society is
 
01:48:29.719 --> 01:48:30.790 align:start position:0%
legally and as far as Society is
concerned

01:48:30.790 --> 01:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
01:48:32.589 --> 01:48:32.599 align:start position:0%
legitimately you know we don't want to
 
01:48:34.189 --> 01:48:34.199 align:start position:0%
push this underground because that's why
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
people get more addiction problems I
 
01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
drank like a fish and it I was underage
 
01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
so the law didn't stop me um and it
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
didn't stop most people it still doesn't
 
01:48:47.790 --> 01:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
stop people now that we see as no no one
 
01:48:49.149 --> 01:48:49.159 align:start position:0%
in here thinks that prohibition has
 
01:48:50.669 --> 01:48:50.679 align:start position:0%
stopped people from smoking or using
 
01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis or even during uh prohibition
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
some people smoke drank a little less
 
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
during prohibition but they drank more
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
and they drank more dangerous products I
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
think it's important to bring them into
 
01:49:02.030 --> 01:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
a safe um safe environment and get
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
something that is uh regulated and
 
01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
approved and I'll stop talking because I
 
01:49:09.070 --> 01:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
know I can keep going thank you other
 
01:49:11.070 --> 01:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no other questions
 
01:49:13.229 --> 01:49:13.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're
 
01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:15.400 align:start position:0%

executive session on uh several bills
 
02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
under house rules um if the chairman and
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
the ranking member of the committee are
 
02:14:22.830 --> 02:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
in agreement uh bills that were heard
 
02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:24.599 align:start position:0%
today can also be considered an
 
02:14:27.310 --> 02:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
executive session uh so the committee
 
02:14:29.069 --> 02:14:29.079 align:start position:0%
will be considering at this time House
 
02:14:31.950 --> 02:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 1278 representative McLean do you
 
02:14:34.629 --> 02:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
have a motion thank you Mr chair I move
 
02:14:37.149 --> 02:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
ought to pass okay representative
 
02:14:39.549 --> 02:14:39.559 align:start position:0%
McClean moves ought to pass on 1278 do I
 
02:14:43.390 --> 02:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
have a second second okay representative
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
Canon seconds representative McLean do
 
02:14:47.629 --> 02:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to your motion well I
 
02:14:49.189 --> 02:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
I think I think we heard some uh oh
 
02:14:51.510 --> 02:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think we heard some
 
02:14:54.109 --> 02:14:54.119 align:start position:0%
uh pretty compelling testimony today I
 
02:14:55.629 --> 02:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
had some of the same questions that
 
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro said you know why
 
02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
do we need to kind of maintain the old
 
02:15:03.390 --> 02:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
system why not just kind of broom it but
 
02:15:07.069 --> 02:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
I think the testimony um really kind of
 
02:15:10.229 --> 02:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
underscored the value of of maintaining
 
02:15:12.669 --> 02:15:12.679 align:start position:0%
uh the current system that we have to
 
02:15:14.589 --> 02:15:14.599 align:start position:0%
give some kind of clarity for those who
 
02:15:17.470 --> 02:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
are less familiar while bringing in uh
 
02:15:19.750 --> 02:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh the second tier for those that have
 
02:15:22.189 --> 02:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge to allow for more discretion
 
02:15:24.030 --> 02:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
and hopefully expand access for those
 
02:15:26.189 --> 02:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
people who need it so um I thought it
 
02:15:28.549 --> 02:15:28.559 align:start position:0%
was a well-crafted bill and there seemed
 
02:15:30.669 --> 02:15:30.679 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of consensus and support
 
02:15:33.109 --> 02:15:33.119 align:start position:0%
behind it so um I'd like to go with
 
02:15:36.510 --> 02:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
octop pass thank you representative
 
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes thank you Mr chairman I I'm
 
02:15:41.470 --> 02:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
going to also vote in support of this I
 
02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
think um you know judging from what
 
02:15:46.510 --> 02:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
we've heard over the years when the
 
02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program program was
 
02:15:50.669 --> 02:15:50.679 align:start position:0%
first conceived of and first became a
 
02:15:52.589 --> 02:15:52.599 align:start position:0%
law it had to be done in the most
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
conservative way possible to get
 
02:15:56.990 --> 02:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
people's support and to try it out and
 
02:16:00.149 --> 02:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
to see whether it was going to be
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
a useful statute a useful program and I
 
02:16:07.549 --> 02:16:07.559 align:start position:0%
think over time it seems to have proved
 
02:16:12.709 --> 02:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
its use and um people seem to be less
 
02:16:15.589 --> 02:16:15.599 align:start position:0%
um not everyone but I think in general
 
02:16:17.790 --> 02:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
people seem to be less concerned conc
 
02:16:20.510 --> 02:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
erned with it creating a disaster and so
 
02:16:23.229 --> 02:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
we've seen um this is my third term and
 
02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
each year we've seen other bills with
 
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
new qualifying conditions and I think
 
02:16:32.709 --> 02:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
um patients are more familiar medical
 
02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
people are more familiar and it's time
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
to give um medical personnel more
 
02:16:40.429 --> 02:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
discretion in um the way this program
 
02:16:42.429 --> 02:16:42.439 align:start position:0%
plays out so I think this is a really
 
02:16:44.469 --> 02:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
good bill and I think um we should
 
02:16:47.070 --> 02:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
support it thank you representative
 
02:16:50.110 --> 02:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you um I I'm supporting it
 
02:16:52.589 --> 02:16:52.599 align:start position:0%
also we had a very entertaining and
 
02:16:54.309 --> 02:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
important discussion this in the
 
02:16:57.669 --> 02:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
Cannabis commission um I just wanted to
 
02:17:00.110 --> 02:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
share one very brief story of somebody I
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
think of every day she was a woman dying
 
02:17:05.709 --> 02:17:05.719 align:start position:0%
of cancer who moved to New Hampshire had
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis where she was
 
02:17:09.549 --> 02:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
coming from and she didn't quite meet
 
02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
the criteria here and so she couldn't
 
02:17:16.309 --> 02:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
get it here and um the woman was doing
 
02:17:18.629 --> 02:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
well where she came came from and was
 
02:17:20.629 --> 02:17:20.639 align:start position:0%
suffering needlessly here and I think
 
02:17:22.790 --> 02:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
bills like this are really important to
 
02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
help people like that and help people
 
02:17:27.509 --> 02:17:27.519 align:start position:0%
like me do what I think is right to help
 
02:17:31.070 --> 02:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
them um at the end of life and whatever
 
02:17:33.429 --> 02:17:33.439 align:start position:0%

representative kushman do you want to
 
02:20:03.870 --> 02:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion sure so there's
 
02:20:05.990 --> 02:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
several reasons um there were some
 
02:20:08.270 --> 02:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
logistical issues with the bill some
 
02:20:12.590 --> 02:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
concerns uh about fraud and the ability
 
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
to sell a
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
vehicle um issues with you know who owns
 
02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
the title and how maintenance is going
 
02:20:24.670 --> 02:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
to be dealt with um while I do very much
 
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
sympathize um with the struggles of of
 
02:20:32.230 --> 02:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
obtaining and Ma maintaining a vehicle I
 
02:20:36.110 --> 02:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
don't believe that it is um the state's
 
02:20:38.830 --> 02:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
place to step in and be the main
 
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
Foundation of a charitable organization
 
02:20:44.190 --> 02:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
I think that should be done um through
 
02:20:46.150 --> 02:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
private donations
 
02:20:49.389 --> 02:20:49.399 align:start position:0%
primarily um um and I just see a lot of
 
02:20:52.590 --> 02:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
issues with actually uh putting this
 
02:20:57.309 --> 02:20:57.319 align:start position:0%
bill uh into place and enacting it thank
 
02:21:00.309 --> 02:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
you okay representative kushman you want
 
02:21:02.510 --> 02:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
to speak to you a
 
02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
second oh I'm sorry repres oh
 
02:21:07.750 --> 02:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative play on I'm sorry yes um
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman many l um I I have
 
02:21:12.349 --> 02:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
to say that the work that the good news
 
02:21:14.270 --> 02:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
garage and other people like that do is
 
02:21:16.150 --> 02:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely amazing and is something that
 
02:21:18.510 --> 02:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely should be reported um the
 
02:21:20.110 --> 02:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
reason why I don't think that this is
 
02:21:20.990 --> 02:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
something that should be done through
 
02:21:22.550 --> 02:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
the government is you have some
 
02:21:24.830 --> 02:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
questions around the issue of the title
 
02:21:26.270 --> 02:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
I recognize that in the past there
 
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
hasn't been much of an issue with people
 
02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
selling cars but quite frankly the
 
02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
economic condition we're in is um
 
02:21:33.910 --> 02:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
quickly approaching something we haven't
 
02:21:36.030 --> 02:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
seen in a long time and people will be
 
02:21:37.349 --> 02:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
under pressures that they haven't been
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
under economically um that could
 
02:21:42.150 --> 02:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
increase the chance that somebody may
 
02:21:44.670 --> 02:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
not act may not keep the car as long
 
02:21:46.429 --> 02:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
because at that point they may be
 
02:21:47.830 --> 02:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
choosing between making their rent
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
payment paying for something for food
 
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
for their kids and you're looking at
 
02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
different needs and different um
 
02:21:55.590 --> 02:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
conflicts you know the fact that the
 
02:21:56.990 --> 02:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
economy is worsening means that it's
 
02:21:58.870 --> 02:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
more important that people do Ste step
 
02:22:01.510 --> 02:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
up to help people obtain reliable
 
02:22:04.510 --> 02:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
transportation but if we were to make it
 
02:22:06.630 --> 02:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
so that the state held title in order to
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
keep these cars from being sold too
 
02:22:11.190 --> 02:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
quickly then if there's an accident as
 
02:22:13.429 --> 02:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
the title holder the state would then be
 
02:22:15.750 --> 02:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
liable um you have all of these
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
different issues and all of these
 
02:22:20.590 --> 02:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
complexities that that really only exist
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
when you're doing this at the state
 
02:22:25.070 --> 02:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
level um and I want to encourage as many
 
02:22:27.110 --> 02:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
people as possible to donate to people
 
02:22:29.110 --> 02:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
like good news garage and others who are
 
02:22:31.710 --> 02:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
getting these cars roadworthy in their
 
02:22:34.030 --> 02:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
town I know we have a use car dealership
 
02:22:36.070 --> 02:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
in Dairy that does a lot of this and
 
02:22:37.790 --> 02:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
they make sure that they find cars that
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
are affordable and they help match them
 
02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
to people who need them it's not through
 
02:22:42.910 --> 02:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
a charity but just through something
 
02:22:44.830 --> 02:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
they do in their normal routine work of
 
02:22:46.950 --> 02:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
getting these roadworthy cars that can
 
02:22:49.030 --> 02:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
get get people over the Gap I think that
 
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
we should encourage that through
 
02:22:54.270 --> 02:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
voluntary help um and unfortunately I I
 
02:22:55.750 --> 02:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
think I see way too many problems
 
02:22:57.790 --> 02:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
bringing the state in that would create
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
new complexities so unfortunately I feel
 
02:23:01.950 --> 02:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
that this needs to be itl but I do want
 
02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
to thank the sponsor for all of his
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
really hard work on this because I know
 
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
I know that his intentions are pure and
 
02:23:09.790 --> 02:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
good it's just a matter of of the of the
 
02:23:11.710 --> 02:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
challenges of executing on the plan in
 
02:23:11.720 --> 02:23:12.670 align:start position:0%
challenges of executing on the plan in
the

02:23:12.670 --> 02:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
state other comments representative
 
02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:17.630 align:start position:0%
state other comments representative
Shapero

02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
Shapero
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um I will certainly vote
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
against itl and I'll try to address some
 
02:23:24.870 --> 02:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
of the issues that have been brought up
 
02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
um I think we all um have been through
 
02:23:32.830 --> 02:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
many many discussions about whether to
 
02:23:35.230 --> 02:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
what degree Federal benefits um create
 
02:23:37.030 --> 02:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
dependence and to what degree Federal
 
02:23:39.630 --> 02:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
benefits create resilience and you know
 
02:23:42.510 --> 02:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
in the case of Medicaid um Wellness so
 
02:23:44.230 --> 02:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
that people can go on with their lives
 
02:23:46.230 --> 02:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
and but I think we're all in agreement
 
02:23:48.510 --> 02:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
that we want people to be
 
02:23:51.190 --> 02:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient and
 
02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:52.830 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient and
um

02:23:52.830 --> 02:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:57.550 --> 02:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
self-reliant and um and not to be on on
 
02:23:59.630 --> 02:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
on federal benefits not to be on tanif
 
02:24:01.830 --> 02:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
in this case because I don't think
 
02:24:05.710 --> 02:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
that's um any picnic for anybody
 
02:24:09.309 --> 02:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
um people who are on tanif are still
 
02:24:11.550 --> 02:24:11.560 align:start position:0%
impoverished and so we all want people
 
02:24:13.349 --> 02:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
to move on with their lives and to be
 
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
more successful and um as I mentioned in
 
02:24:20.590 --> 02:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
in my original testimony um there's a
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
working group within um DHHS called the
 
02:24:26.630 --> 02:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
benefits Cliff effect workg group that's
 
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
been focusing on what are the systemic
 
02:24:32.510 --> 02:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
issues that keep people from going off
 
02:24:36.469 --> 02:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
of these benefits and the one challenge
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
that they came up with and there are
 
02:24:39.389 --> 02:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
numerous challenges I don't know if
 
02:24:41.950 --> 02:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
anybody looked at that on the um DHHS
 
02:24:43.990 --> 02:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
website there are many challenges they
 
02:24:46.429 --> 02:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
came up with and they paired each
 
02:24:46.439 --> 02:24:47.750 align:start position:0%
came up with and they paired each
challenge

02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
02:24:50.670 --> 02:24:50.680 align:start position:0%
with a um pilot project to see if they
 
02:24:52.630 --> 02:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
could make progress in helping people
 
02:24:54.990 --> 02:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
get off benefits and the one thing that
 
02:24:58.469 --> 02:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
they didn't come up with a with a um
 
02:25:01.469 --> 02:25:01.479 align:start position:0%
that they didn't pair with a um pilot
 
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
project was Transportation challenges
 
02:25:07.870 --> 02:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
and we know that people um cars are very
 
02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
expensive they become increasingly
 
02:25:13.389 --> 02:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
expensive and without an automobile it
 
02:25:17.070 --> 02:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
is very hard to get not only a job but a
 
02:25:20.670 --> 02:25:20.680 align:start position:0%
good job um and um and then to be able
 
02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
to maintain that job so that was my
 
02:25:26.510 --> 02:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
original intent in bringing this up when
 
02:25:30.190 --> 02:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
we did have our um hearing there were
 
02:25:34.190 --> 02:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
um you know would would this be really a
 
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
sustainable program and with the worst
 
02:25:43.550 --> 02:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
case example being that um someone gets
 
02:25:49.070 --> 02:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
so one thing is that we heard from the
 
02:25:53.910 --> 02:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
people here from Good News garage who
 
02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
ran this program in conjunction with the
 
02:25:58.670 --> 02:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
state um it was just anecdotal there
 
02:26:01.349 --> 02:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't data but um that that had not
 
02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
been an issue um after the after the
 
02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
original hearing I had um several
 
02:26:09.790 --> 02:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
discussions with Karen Hebert who was
 
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
the director of the division of economic
 
02:26:18.309 --> 02:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
stability so you know within the within
 
02:26:18.319 --> 02:26:19.910 align:start position:0%
stability so you know within the within
DHHS

02:26:19.910 --> 02:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS
 
02:26:24.110 --> 02:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
um tanif comes under economic stability
 
02:26:28.590 --> 02:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
in other words um the intention of of um
 
02:26:31.309 --> 02:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
of this program is to really create
 
02:26:33.349 --> 02:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
economic stability for people it's not
 
02:26:37.070 --> 02:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
to have them be un tanif and so given
 
02:26:40.429 --> 02:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
that she explained to me um how they
 
02:26:42.990 --> 02:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
would develop criteria for PE for who
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
gets these cars to try to ensure that
 
02:26:48.910 --> 02:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
they actually led
 
02:26:52.510 --> 02:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
to sustained self-sufficiency and
 
02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
self-reliance and she talked about um
 
02:26:57.750 --> 02:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
several things um but I but the
 
02:26:59.790 --> 02:26:59.800 align:start position:0%
importance of identifying who are the
 
02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
good candidates to get these cars
 
02:27:05.469 --> 02:27:05.479 align:start position:0%
because they they're really invested in
 
02:27:09.269 --> 02:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
in the success of um their clients and
 
02:27:11.550 --> 02:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
success does not just mean getting off T
 
02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
if it means um really moving towards a
 
02:27:17.070 --> 02:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
middle class life where they can support
 
02:27:18.389 --> 02:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
their kids because these are all
 
02:27:21.230 --> 02:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
families with kids so they talked about
 
02:27:24.269 --> 02:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
some of the um she was certainly not
 
02:27:25.950 --> 02:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
telling me specifically what the
 
02:27:28.630 --> 02:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
criteria but some of the broad Strokes
 
02:27:31.790 --> 02:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
of what the criteria would involve um
 
02:27:34.990 --> 02:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
would be obviously people without
 
02:27:38.309 --> 02:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
cars um but also people who were Work
 
02:27:43.269 --> 02:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
Ready who had participated within the um
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire Employment Program
 
02:27:50.150 --> 02:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
career counseling program um and taking
 
02:27:52.990 --> 02:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
courses in Workforce Development
 
02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:54.710 align:start position:0%
courses in Workforce Development
education

02:27:54.710 --> 02:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:27:56.910 --> 02:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
um employment
 
02:27:56.920 --> 02:27:58.429 align:start position:0%
um employment
Readiness

02:27:58.429 --> 02:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
Readiness
 
02:28:02.269 --> 02:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
um and financial literacy um I think
 
02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
financial literacy was key because that
 
02:28:07.269 --> 02:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
only not only leads to getting a job and
 
02:28:10.349 --> 02:28:10.359 align:start position:0%
a better job but it also includes being
 
02:28:12.230 --> 02:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
able to manage your money so that you
 
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
can maintain a car because we all know
 
02:28:16.710 --> 02:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
you don't just get a car and that's it
 
02:28:19.230 --> 02:28:19.240 align:start position:0%
you have to have money for maintenance
 
02:28:21.070 --> 02:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
you have to have money for hopefully you
 
02:28:23.550 --> 02:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
have money for insurance and for
 
02:28:25.349 --> 02:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
inspections and the
 
02:28:28.110 --> 02:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
like and she said that they would also
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
be targeting people who are not only
 
02:28:35.830 --> 02:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
ready to work and all these people are
 
02:28:38.309 --> 02:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
already in a work program um so it's
 
02:28:40.830 --> 02:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
there's a work requirement but they
 
02:28:42.990 --> 02:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
would be targeting people who are not
 
02:28:45.429 --> 02:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
just looking for the next job but
 
02:28:48.309 --> 02:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
targeting people who've made advances in
 
02:28:51.790 --> 02:28:51.800 align:start position:0%
terms of developing a career so through
 
02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
the um career counseling program there
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
have been opportunities for people to
 
02:29:00.870 --> 02:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
like get certified in various things so
 
02:29:03.110 --> 02:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
that they're not only on towards the
 
02:29:04.910 --> 02:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
next job but they're arm towards a
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
career and so these are some of the
 
02:29:09.190 --> 02:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
factors that would be taken into
 
02:29:12.110 --> 02:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
consideration in deciding who is
 
02:29:14.469 --> 02:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
eligible for getting one of these
 
02:29:17.389 --> 02:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
Automobiles and um
 
02:29:20.429 --> 02:29:20.439 align:start position:0%
these are the factors that um she felt
 
02:29:20.439 --> 02:29:21.670 align:start position:0%
these are the factors that um she felt
would

02:29:21.670 --> 02:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
ensure or you can't ensure but decrease
 
02:29:27.870 --> 02:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
the likelihood that people are not going
 
02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
to um
 
02:29:34.429 --> 02:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
sustain this effort um towards
 
02:29:38.750 --> 02:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
independence um through getting a car so
 
02:29:41.309 --> 02:29:41.319 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously I think it's a
 
02:29:44.469 --> 02:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
great idea so I'm going to vote against
 
02:29:48.190 --> 02:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
itl thank you represent pres dep
 
02:29:51.510 --> 02:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
pmer thank you Mr chair I also
 
02:29:52.910 --> 02:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored this bill and I
 
02:29:55.190 --> 02:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored it for one main reason
 
02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
which is that I donated a car to Good
 
02:30:01.389 --> 02:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
News Garage in Vermont and um the
 
02:30:03.550 --> 02:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
anecdote part of this is like almost a
 
02:30:05.910 --> 02:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
year later I got a letter from the the
 
02:30:08.190 --> 02:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
people who'd gotten the car saying how
 
02:30:10.389 --> 02:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
grateful they were and how much it had
 
02:30:12.190 --> 02:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
it had helped their lives and that they
 
02:30:15.510 --> 02:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
were going on exactly the result you'd
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
want and as far as the concern that it
 
02:30:21.030 --> 02:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
might be abused this is a pilot program
 
02:30:23.750 --> 02:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
so it's a perfect time just to do a
 
02:30:26.830 --> 02:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
pilot program see see if it works see if
 
02:30:28.790 --> 02:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
they problems if if if the problems
 
02:30:30.670 --> 02:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
aren't fixable then end the program and
 
02:30:33.269 --> 02:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
if they're fixable fix them so I'm also
 
02:30:36.510 --> 02:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
going to vote against the itl thank you
 
02:30:38.750 --> 02:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
02:30:40.710 --> 02:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
chair I'm going to take a different tack
 
02:30:43.790 --> 02:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
on this um we have many people in our
 
02:30:45.870 --> 02:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
society unfortunately or fortunately how
 
02:30:47.429 --> 02:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
you look at it
 
02:30:50.389 --> 02:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
that are really dependent upon the state
 
02:30:52.110 --> 02:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
whether it be a tanif program whether it
 
02:30:54.190 --> 02:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
would be snap programs and so forth for
 
02:30:56.710 --> 02:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
various reasons many times not any fault
 
02:30:57.670 --> 02:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
of their
 
02:31:00.670 --> 02:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
own I went back and looked at the
 
02:31:02.429 --> 02:31:02.439 align:start position:0%
documentation that was provided to us
 
02:31:04.550 --> 02:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health Human
 
02:31:07.230 --> 02:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
Services and what it showed in there
 
02:31:09.389 --> 02:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
that this was a bridge to get people off
 
02:31:13.630 --> 02:31:13.640 align:start position:0%
the state and on their own so this in a
 
02:31:15.429 --> 02:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
lot of ways is helping the state do
 
02:31:17.630 --> 02:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're trying to to do is
 
02:31:20.830 --> 02:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
turning me into taxpaying citizens so
 
02:31:22.870 --> 02:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
therefore if you look in the Department
 
02:31:25.830 --> 02:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
of Health Human Services back in
 
02:31:28.349 --> 02:31:28.359 align:start position:0%
2017 every single
 
02:31:32.110 --> 02:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
person the cash payments go into tanif
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
was $1,500
 
02:31:37.429 --> 02:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
less less folks so the state has a
 
02:31:39.469 --> 02:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
vested interest
 
02:31:43.309 --> 02:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
economically to support s this program
 
02:31:45.950 --> 02:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
because if we can find a way to get
 
02:31:51.429 --> 02:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
people from TANF from snap off those
 
02:31:55.150 --> 02:31:55.160 align:start position:0%
programs and fend for themselves we
 
02:31:58.110 --> 02:31:58.120 align:start position:0%
helping ourselves and helping the state
 
02:32:01.790 --> 02:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
treasury secondly when you deal with the
 
02:32:03.990 --> 02:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
car ownership which I don't disagree
 
02:32:05.190 --> 02:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
with it's a
 
02:32:07.630 --> 02:32:07.640 align:start position:0%
concern but that's why this is a pilot
 
02:32:11.349 --> 02:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
if we do see evidence through the pilot
 
02:32:13.710 --> 02:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
that that behavior is in fact
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
occurring then you can deal with it by
 
02:32:19.750 --> 02:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
not having the pilot go forward so I'll
 
02:32:22.550 --> 02:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
stress to you folks here this is in the
 
02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
state's best economic benefit to support
 
02:32:28.870 --> 02:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
this program to help people get off
 
02:32:31.590 --> 02:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
social programs that cost us money to
 
02:32:33.790 --> 02:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
become self-sufficient and become a
 
02:32:36.710 --> 02:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
taxpaying citizen of the State versus a
 
02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
consumer thank you thank
 
02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
you other
 
02:32:44.510 --> 02:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
comments yes representative Seth K thank
 
02:32:46.750 --> 02:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I've got a few reasons
 
02:32:49.230 --> 02:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
outlined while I'll be voting uh in
 
02:32:50.510 --> 02:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
favor of
 
02:32:54.070 --> 02:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
itl um number one uh gratitude versus
 
02:32:56.950 --> 02:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
entitlement um representative Palmer
 
02:32:59.670 --> 02:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
here gave an example of how he had
 
02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
donated a car and somebody was extremely
 
02:33:03.550 --> 02:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
grateful for that and I find that when
 
02:33:05.630 --> 02:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
there's voluntary charity involved
 
02:33:07.990 --> 02:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
people are genuinely grateful and there
 
02:33:09.550 --> 02:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
is real gratitude but when they get
 
02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
something from the government they feel
 
02:33:12.510 --> 02:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
a sense of entitlement like well I pay
 
02:33:14.190 --> 02:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
my taxes so therefore I'm just getting
 
02:33:15.429 --> 02:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
something that I'm just getting a little
 
02:33:17.790 --> 02:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
bit of my tax money back and I'm very
 
02:33:19.510 --> 02:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
much against the entitlement mentality I
 
02:33:21.510 --> 02:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to increase that and I think
 
02:33:22.710 --> 02:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
that yes there are going to be a lot of
 
02:33:24.389 --> 02:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
people that would take advantage of this
 
02:33:25.550 --> 02:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
and they would have the entitlement
 
02:33:27.790 --> 02:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
mentality like their ow a car instead of
 
02:33:29.910 --> 02:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
the Gratitude of thank you somebody for
 
02:33:33.110 --> 02:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
voluntarily donating a car um number two
 
02:33:34.950 --> 02:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
this is just a little bit of socialism
 
02:33:38.110 --> 02:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
that I don't agree with number three um
 
02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
it it was mentioned in um um public
 
02:33:43.830 --> 02:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
hearing that few are known to turn
 
02:33:46.469 --> 02:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
around and sell their cars but um how
 
02:33:48.830 --> 02:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
many are unknown because they don't keep
 
02:33:50.230 --> 02:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
track of all these cars they don't keep
 
02:33:51.750 --> 02:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
track of very many I mean unless you
 
02:33:54.110 --> 02:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
know personally the people you're giving
 
02:33:55.349 --> 02:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
these cars to how are you going to know
 
02:33:57.230 --> 02:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
if they turn around so there could be a
 
02:33:58.790 --> 02:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
lot of cars that are turned around and
 
02:34:01.710 --> 02:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
sold they don't know of um next how many
 
02:34:04.070 --> 02:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
are simply abandoned due to lack of
 
02:34:06.830 --> 02:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
upkeep how many people turn around and
 
02:34:08.030 --> 02:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
they've got great intentions they want
 
02:34:09.790 --> 02:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
to keep that car and then three months
 
02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
later boom there's a $3,000 maintenance
 
02:34:14.110 --> 02:34:14.120 align:start position:0%
bill that they don't they can't afford
 
02:34:16.150 --> 02:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
and then they just it just ends up
 
02:34:18.110 --> 02:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
sitting and rotting in their driveway or
 
02:34:19.950 --> 02:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
they give it away or who knows what
 
02:34:23.510 --> 02:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
happens um next is the costs are
 
02:34:26.429 --> 02:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
actually much higher to fuel insure and
 
02:34:28.309 --> 02:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
maintain a vehicle than just getting a
 
02:34:30.950 --> 02:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
cheap vehicle um you know I recently
 
02:34:32.590 --> 02:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
bought a few years ago I bought a a
 
02:34:33.630 --> 02:34:33.640 align:start position:0%
truck for
 
02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
$6,000 last year I put $5,000 in just to
 
02:34:39.510 --> 02:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
keep it on the road uh so and that's
 
02:34:41.030 --> 02:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
just for this year every year I'm
 
02:34:42.870 --> 02:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
spending more money on the truck than I
 
02:34:46.349 --> 02:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
do in actual the truck um so if somebody
 
02:34:48.790 --> 02:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
is incapable of getting quite quite
 
02:34:51.230 --> 02:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
frankly the cheaper part of maintaining
 
02:34:52.750 --> 02:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
keeping a vehicle the cheapest part is
 
02:34:54.389 --> 02:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
getting the vehicle unless you buy a
 
02:34:55.710 --> 02:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
brand new one but if you get a used
 
02:34:57.230 --> 02:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
vehicle that only has a couple years of
 
02:34:58.910 --> 02:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
life left on anyways the cheapest part
 
02:35:00.030 --> 02:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
is getting the vehicle the most
 
02:35:02.309 --> 02:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
expensive part is the upkeep um if
 
02:35:04.269 --> 02:35:04.279 align:start position:0%
they're not capable of maintaining it
 
02:35:06.469 --> 02:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
then um there's you're just wasting
 
02:35:10.150 --> 02:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
money um so I'd like to give you one
 
02:35:12.670 --> 02:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
example also a personal example many
 
02:35:16.950 --> 02:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
years ago uh we had a female dog that uh
 
02:35:18.710 --> 02:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
had some puppies we weren't a a puppy
 
02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
mill but you know happen stce we had
 
02:35:22.990 --> 02:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
some puppies and um we always made sure
 
02:35:25.190 --> 02:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
that we we sold our puppies for like a
 
02:35:27.469 --> 02:35:27.479 align:start position:0%
hundred bucks because we didn't want to
 
02:35:29.469 --> 02:35:29.479 align:start position:0%
give them to anybody who couldn't pay at
 
02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
least a hundred bucks for a puppy you
 
02:35:33.670 --> 02:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
know it's like you're going to spend so
 
02:35:35.550 --> 02:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
much money on this animal throughout the
 
02:35:36.910 --> 02:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
course of its life if you can't even
 
02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
afford $100 for a puppy we're not we're
 
02:35:40.950 --> 02:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
not giving you a puppy and there were
 
02:35:42.790 --> 02:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
even times where people would come by
 
02:35:44.990 --> 02:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
and maybe they did have a 100 bucks but
 
02:35:47.030 --> 02:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
you could just tell this person is not
 
02:35:49.670 --> 02:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
capable of treating that puppy well and
 
02:35:51.389 --> 02:35:51.399 align:start position:0%
we would we would reject some people
 
02:35:52.950 --> 02:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
from having a dog because you could just
 
02:35:54.990 --> 02:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
tell these people aren't they're not
 
02:35:56.790 --> 02:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
they can't even take care of themselves
 
02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
they're not going to take care of a
 
02:35:59.910 --> 02:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
puppy now let me ask you when it comes
 
02:36:01.630 --> 02:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
to Transportation what if we didn't have
 
02:36:03.389 --> 02:36:03.399 align:start position:0%
cars what if they were horses would you
 
02:36:06.349 --> 02:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable giving a majestic beast
 
02:36:08.429 --> 02:36:08.439 align:start position:0%
like a horse to somebody who's incapable
 
02:36:09.950 --> 02:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
of taking care of that horse that would
 
02:36:12.510 --> 02:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
be animal cruelty so when it comes to
 
02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
automobiles okay you're you're giving an
 
02:36:17.349 --> 02:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
automobile to somebody who has shown
 
02:36:20.070 --> 02:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
that they can't they don't have the
 
02:36:21.469 --> 02:36:21.479 align:start position:0%
credit I mean why can't they go out and
 
02:36:23.550 --> 02:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
get a car on credit so you're saying
 
02:36:25.710 --> 02:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
they have no credit they don't have any
 
02:36:27.230 --> 02:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
family or friends that could give them a
 
02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle they don't have a church they
 
02:36:30.550 --> 02:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
don't have any Community that's willing
 
02:36:32.230 --> 02:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
to give them a few thousand doar for a
 
02:36:34.950 --> 02:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
for for a vehicle but but we the
 
02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are going to give that to them
 
02:36:38.550 --> 02:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
and then what are they going to do with
 
02:36:39.790 --> 02:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
that vehicle if they don't even have the
 
02:36:41.349 --> 02:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
capability of getting a few thousand
 
02:36:43.309 --> 02:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
bucks to get the vehicle they definitely
 
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to maintain the
 
02:36:46.950 --> 02:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle so so this whole this whole
 
02:36:49.870 --> 02:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
program I'm just against 100% thank you
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you other comments representative
 
02:36:57.750 --> 02:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes it's um it's a choice that I
 
02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
make that to believe
 
02:37:05.469 --> 02:37:05.479 align:start position:0%
that people who are lowincome people who
 
02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
can't afford to have a car people who'
 
02:37:10.110 --> 02:37:10.120 align:start position:0%
have maybe had some trauma in their life
 
02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
that's LED them to this situation that
 
02:37:14.269 --> 02:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
they're motivated by the same things
 
02:37:17.990 --> 02:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
that I'm motivated by and
 
02:37:20.990 --> 02:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
um and that they would be you know given
 
02:37:22.870 --> 02:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
the right situation they would behave in
 
02:37:26.710 --> 02:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
a way that's similar to me and um so I
 
02:37:29.150 --> 02:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
choose to not think of these people as
 
02:37:32.030 --> 02:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
those kinds of people and myself and us
 
02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
as other kinds of people which is why I
 
02:37:37.429 --> 02:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
would do anything I could to help people
 
02:37:40.349 --> 02:37:40.359 align:start position:0%
get a step up
 
02:37:44.550 --> 02:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
um and become self-sufficient um as I've
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
been lucky to be in my life life um and
 
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
the other thing I would say is that
 
02:37:53.590 --> 02:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
um I would just say to representative
 
02:37:55.269 --> 02:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
King that perhaps if he had gotten his
 
02:37:57.110 --> 02:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
truck from Good News garage he would
 
02:37:59.230 --> 02:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
have had better luck with the truck
 
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
because they check them out before they
 
02:38:02.269 --> 02:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
U give them to
 
02:38:06.110 --> 02:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
people thank you other comments
 
02:38:08.429 --> 02:38:08.439 align:start position:0%
representative blon um thank you um just
 
02:38:09.950 --> 02:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
really quickly I guess the one thing
 
02:38:12.309 --> 02:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
that I want to say is that there are
 
02:38:14.790 --> 02:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
people that are very capable and there's
 
02:38:16.429 --> 02:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
people who are incapable there's people
 
02:38:17.790 --> 02:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
who are honest there are people who are
 
02:38:19.670 --> 02:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
dishonest and that cuts across all
 
02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
income levels just because somebody has
 
02:38:23.550 --> 02:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of money doesn't mean that they'd
 
02:38:25.110 --> 02:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
be somebody who would be a good faith
 
02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
actor in a program like this and just
 
02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
because somebody is lower income doesn't
 
02:38:30.389 --> 02:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
mean that they're automatically a good
 
02:38:32.550 --> 02:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
faith actor um I just want to assume
 
02:38:34.510 --> 02:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
that everybody in every category of
 
02:38:38.070 --> 02:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
people is just as just as flawed and
 
02:38:40.710 --> 02:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
just as good as any one of us um and so
 
02:38:42.070 --> 02:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a judgment on any of the
 
02:38:44.030 --> 02:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
individuals based on their income level
 
02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's more a note about human nature and
 
02:38:49.630 --> 02:38:49.640 align:start position:0%
about the flaws that we all share so and
 
02:38:51.389 --> 02:38:51.399 align:start position:0%
I I think that I think that as a
 
02:38:53.389 --> 02:38:53.399 align:start position:0%
voluntary thing there's more benefits so
 
02:38:54.429 --> 02:38:54.439 align:start position:0%
that's that's the reason for my
 
02:38:56.070 --> 02:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
seconding in my motion but I just wanted
 
02:38:58.349 --> 02:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
to clarify that so that we don't get uh
 
02:38:59.870 --> 02:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
on each other's toes a little bit too
 
02:39:05.070 --> 02:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:08.790 --> 02:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
fedus oh there you go um
 
02:39:12.030 --> 02:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
I'm feeling confident about the safety
 
02:39:13.630 --> 02:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
net that's around this that these are
 
02:39:16.269 --> 02:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
not just somebody getting a car they're
 
02:39:18.429 --> 02:39:18.439 align:start position:0%
in the Department's temporary assistance
 
02:39:20.469 --> 02:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
program they're participating in the
 
02:39:22.910 --> 02:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
Employment Program they have a valid
 
02:39:25.670 --> 02:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
license they have an individualized work
 
02:39:27.389 --> 02:39:27.399 align:start position:0%
plan so I think there are some
 
02:39:29.950 --> 02:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
safeguards that this program could be
 
02:39:32.990 --> 02:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
successful and I and in favor of it
 
02:39:36.830 --> 02:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative tez
 
02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman so uh for me uh
 
02:39:42.870 --> 02:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
the issue in addition to what's been
 
02:39:45.950 --> 02:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
stated already is um we live in a in a
 
02:39:47.710 --> 02:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
state where we don't have the kind of
 
02:39:50.269 --> 02:39:50.279 align:start position:0%
Transportation infrastructure that other
 
02:39:53.309 --> 02:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
places have and so it's a huge barrier
 
02:39:55.910 --> 02:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
for many people for many reasons and
 
02:40:00.030 --> 02:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
many domains and being able to get to a
 
02:40:03.670 --> 02:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
job right for self-sufficiency purposes
 
02:40:05.389 --> 02:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
if this is all that would really be a
 
02:40:08.309 --> 02:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
limiting factor and there's a proven
 
02:40:10.510 --> 02:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
program that was successful here for 15
 
02:40:13.870 --> 02:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
years and right now we're the only state
 
02:40:16.349 --> 02:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
um that isn't off in it I actually
 
02:40:18.070 --> 02:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
donated my C at goodnos garage a few
 
02:40:19.750 --> 02:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
years ago I think it was one of the
 
02:40:22.030 --> 02:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
older ones that probably just you know
 
02:40:25.429 --> 02:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
they sold for parts um I I feel like we
 
02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of really great information
 
02:40:29.469 --> 02:40:29.479 align:start position:0%
about how they make sure the cars are
 
02:40:32.630 --> 02:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
going to be pretty good for a while and
 
02:40:35.269 --> 02:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of information about how people
 
02:40:37.630 --> 02:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
are successful because of the guard
 
02:40:40.429 --> 02:40:40.439 align:start position:0%
rails that exist for a you know defined
 
02:40:42.710 --> 02:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
population and I really
 
02:40:44.990 --> 02:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think that making
 
02:40:47.630 --> 02:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
assumptions about the worst
 
02:40:50.750 --> 02:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
possible behavior is the way to make a
 
02:40:52.870 --> 02:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
decision about something that actually
 
02:40:56.389 --> 02:40:56.399 align:start position:0%
is proven and will be beneficial both to
 
02:41:00.670 --> 02:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
our um interest as uh public funds but
 
02:41:03.349 --> 02:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
also because we want to invest in the
 
02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
economic uh uh opportunity of our our
 
02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
constituents so that they can be
 
02:41:12.670 --> 02:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
prosperous and so they can be thriving
 
02:41:14.230 --> 02:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
um members and let's remember a lot of
 
02:41:16.830 --> 02:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
people end up on tan if because they had
 
02:41:19.269 --> 02:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
some kind of Health thing right uh all
 
02:41:20.830 --> 02:41:20.840 align:start position:0%
sorts of things are reasons for why
 
02:41:23.630 --> 02:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
people end up on tanif um and the goal
 
02:41:24.830 --> 02:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
is that it be
 
02:41:28.950 --> 02:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
temporary um so I I'll vote against itl
 
02:41:31.030 --> 02:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions I mean excuse
 
02:41:33.349 --> 02:41:33.359 align:start position:0%

this

02:46:05.389 --> 02:46:05.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:46:07.950 --> 02:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
was sometimes we go at night home at
 
02:46:10.870 --> 02:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
night after bills here and feel somewhat
 
02:46:14.190 --> 02:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
tortured I suppose this is one of those
 
02:46:16.630 --> 02:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
um but I'm speaking speaking as um
 
02:46:18.630 --> 02:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
somebody who's worked with people with
 
02:46:21.110 --> 02:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
disabilities his entire life somebody
 
02:46:24.150 --> 02:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
whose mother was disabled somebody whose
 
02:46:26.429 --> 02:46:26.439 align:start position:0%
son has a developmental disability
 
02:46:27.990 --> 02:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
someone who was actually recruited to
 
02:46:29.990 --> 02:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire by Easter Seals
 
02:46:31.790 --> 02:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
and I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for
 
02:46:33.389 --> 02:46:33.399 align:start position:0%
Easter Seals and somebody that
 
02:46:36.309 --> 02:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
volunteered with Special Olympics so
 
02:46:38.670 --> 02:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
it's an issue that's very important to
 
02:46:42.269 --> 02:46:42.279 align:start position:0%
me in a lot of different ways um however
 
02:46:45.590 --> 02:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
um as I listen to the testimony I was
 
02:46:48.230 --> 02:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
actually surprised that I came to oppose
 
02:46:51.269 --> 02:46:51.279 align:start position:0%
this bill because um superficially I
 
02:46:54.030 --> 02:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
actually supported it and and the reason
 
02:46:56.510 --> 02:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
why was as I was listening to people
 
02:46:59.750 --> 02:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
talk you know I have one non-d
 
02:47:01.830 --> 02:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled child and one
 
02:47:04.750 --> 02:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
who is and I know the terminology is not
 
02:47:08.710 --> 02:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
accurate but um that's what I use um and
 
02:47:11.150 --> 02:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
I was thinking about how important you
 
02:47:15.190 --> 02:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
know out of school out of work um
 
02:47:19.309 --> 02:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
experiences were for both of them and um
 
02:47:21.190 --> 02:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
and made them who they are today they're
 
02:47:24.309 --> 02:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
both in their 30s now but um you know
 
02:47:26.870 --> 02:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
when I looked at it all the services
 
02:47:29.550 --> 02:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
that they received were provided by
 
02:47:32.950 --> 02:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
non-governmental sources um Boy Scouts
 
02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
best buddies um things like that and I
 
02:47:39.389 --> 02:47:39.399 align:start position:0%
paid for both able-body and non-
 
02:47:41.230 --> 02:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
able-bodied and that's where I started
 
02:47:44.110 --> 02:47:44.120 align:start position:0%
to struggle with this is what makes us
 
02:47:46.150 --> 02:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
need to support report one versus the
 
02:47:47.429 --> 02:47:47.439 align:start position:0%
other and then I thought we were
 
02:47:49.389 --> 02:47:49.399 align:start position:0%
starting to go down a slippery slope
 
02:47:52.429 --> 02:47:52.439 align:start position:0%
that really concerned me um I really
 
02:47:54.469 --> 02:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
think that nonprofits do an absolutely
 
02:47:56.630 --> 02:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
wonderful job providing a lot of these
 
02:47:58.870 --> 02:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
Services already and I was struggling
 
02:48:00.910 --> 02:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
with the concept that we would do this
 
02:48:04.190 --> 02:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
in this manner um with that said as I've
 
02:48:07.190 --> 02:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
already stated this is important I know
 
02:48:09.269 --> 02:48:09.279 align:start position:0%
these experiences are extremely
 
02:48:12.710 --> 02:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
important and relating to many of the
 
02:48:14.990 --> 02:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
comments are made during the testimony
 
02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:16.070 align:start position:0%
comments are made during the testimony
um

02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:19.070 --> 02:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
I totally accept and acknowledge the
 
02:48:21.830 --> 02:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
role of folks with all sorts of
 
02:48:23.750 --> 02:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities and non disabilities as
 
02:48:26.429 --> 02:48:26.439 align:start position:0%
part of the fabric of our community um
 
02:48:28.790 --> 02:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
that that's by reasoning representative
 
02:48:30.429 --> 02:48:30.439 align:start position:0%
Lan did you want to speak to you a
 
02:48:33.030 --> 02:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
second yes uh thank you Mr chairman um
 
02:48:35.349 --> 02:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
you know this is a really hard Bill to
 
02:48:38.230 --> 02:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
look at and to see um especially because
 
02:48:40.590 --> 02:48:40.600 align:start position:0%
the whole uh the basically the whole
 
02:48:42.190 --> 02:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
landscape is Shifting around this
 
02:48:45.990 --> 02:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
community right now um I absolutely feel
 
02:48:47.710 --> 02:48:47.720 align:start position:0%
for everybody impacted but I'm also
 
02:48:50.469 --> 02:48:50.479 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how any changes we
 
02:48:52.469 --> 02:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
do now are going to Ripple through in
 
02:48:54.230 --> 02:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
the future we've seen with other
 
02:48:57.030 --> 02:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
programs how what seems like just um a
 
02:48:59.309 --> 02:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
short-term change in order to get over a
 
02:49:01.750 --> 02:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
challenge ends up creating yet another
 
02:49:03.790 --> 02:49:03.800 align:start position:0%
Ripple that then follows through and
 
02:49:06.349 --> 02:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
then has other consequences later on um
 
02:49:08.269 --> 02:49:08.279 align:start position:0%
I struggled with the idea of maybe
 
02:49:10.269 --> 02:49:10.279 align:start position:0%
figuring out how we could just grant out
 
02:49:12.309 --> 02:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that previously were
 
02:49:15.510 --> 02:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
spent by the area agencies um in order
 
02:49:18.349 --> 02:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
to say that you know it last year
 
02:49:20.469 --> 02:49:20.479 align:start position:0%
through through this budget cycle how
 
02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
much would have otherwise been covered
 
02:49:25.429 --> 02:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
under Medicaid in order to fund these
 
02:49:27.229 --> 02:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
services that previously were allowed
 
02:49:29.790 --> 02:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
and now are not but that's a really
 
02:49:31.750 --> 02:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
complex thing to figure out how we would
 
02:49:33.429 --> 02:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
be able to draft that and if there' even
 
02:49:35.870 --> 02:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
be an appetite to say here's some money
 
02:49:37.910 --> 02:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
that is simply a grant that we're going
 
02:49:40.070 --> 02:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
to trust you that you are going to do
 
02:49:42.030 --> 02:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
this because we don't want to put we
 
02:49:44.150 --> 02:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
need to consider this under the larger
 
02:49:46.469 --> 02:49:46.479 align:start position:0%
scheme of how New Hampshire addresses
 
02:49:48.790 --> 02:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
the developmental disabilities Community
 
02:49:50.990 --> 02:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
under the shifting landscape of what
 
02:49:53.510 --> 02:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
comes down from CMS um I'd feel a lot
 
02:49:55.510 --> 02:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
more comfortable quite honestly with
 
02:49:57.870 --> 02:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
almost an unrestricted Grant to the area
 
02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
agencies to allow that to fill that Gap
 
02:50:03.389 --> 02:50:03.399 align:start position:0%
this year but I'm not sure that that's
 
02:50:04.269 --> 02:50:04.279 align:start position:0%
actually something that would be
 
02:50:06.630 --> 02:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
supported by everybody here um and in
 
02:50:08.269 --> 02:50:08.279 align:start position:0%
the absence of that trying to figure out
 
02:50:09.710 --> 02:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
how to carve through this trying to
 
02:50:11.710 --> 02:50:11.720 align:start position:0%
figure out if we'd be able to get to an
 
02:50:13.910 --> 02:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
idea of having these unrestricted grants
 
02:50:16.070 --> 02:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
simply to Pat these holes right now
 
02:50:18.190 --> 02:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
through this transition would be
 
02:50:20.910 --> 02:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
palatable um my assumption was no which
 
02:50:23.389 --> 02:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
is why I've seconded the itl motion but
 
02:50:24.830 --> 02:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
if people want to convince me that we
 
02:50:26.670 --> 02:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
want to do an amendment in order to do a
 
02:50:29.349 --> 02:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
block grant just to get over this hurdle
 
02:50:31.429 --> 02:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
not tying it in and not binding not
 
02:50:33.389 --> 02:50:33.399 align:start position:0%
setting any precedent for future
 
02:50:35.630 --> 02:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
legislation then that would be something
 
02:50:38.030 --> 02:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
I'd be I'd be look into but you know
 
02:50:40.950 --> 02:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
right now it's they're on shifting Sands
 
02:50:42.190 --> 02:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
and we're going to need to look at the
 
02:50:44.030 --> 02:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
program as a whole that's part of why we
 
02:50:45.510 --> 02:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
have that that subcommittee that's
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
looking at this whole transition process
 
02:50:49.269 --> 02:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
as well which I do need to notice and
 
02:50:51.950 --> 02:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
have us meet um but we just we just want
 
02:50:53.190 --> 02:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we can come through
 
02:50:55.429 --> 02:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
with a with a holistic approach to this
 
02:50:58.150 --> 02:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
because I agree um at what point at what
 
02:50:59.750 --> 02:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
point does this become something that is
 
02:51:01.510 --> 02:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
part of the government's responsibility
 
02:51:03.870 --> 02:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
and when does it not and that's a big
 
02:51:05.309 --> 02:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
discussion we need to have especially
 
02:51:07.429 --> 02:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
with the developmentally disabilities
 
02:51:09.550 --> 02:51:09.560 align:start position:0%
community and people whose services are
 
02:51:12.110 --> 02:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
provided through local taxpayers for
 
02:51:14.110 --> 02:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
when they school age but are part of the
 
02:51:16.150 --> 02:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
dep department when they are not school
 
02:51:18.229 --> 02:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
age um I think that we need to really
 
02:51:20.349 --> 02:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
sit down and figure out how to how to
 
02:51:21.790 --> 02:51:21.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that we best benefit this
 
02:51:23.590 --> 02:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
community over their entire lifespan
 
02:51:25.070 --> 02:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
instead of carving it out into these
 
02:51:28.309 --> 02:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
different programs and I I just just I I
 
02:51:29.550 --> 02:51:29.560 align:start position:0%
just don't think that the way that it's
 
02:51:32.190 --> 02:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
been presented to us is the best path
 
02:51:33.710 --> 02:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
forward which is why I've seconded the
 
02:51:36.269 --> 02:51:36.279 align:start position:0%
itl representative sh Shapero you had
 
02:51:38.389 --> 02:51:38.399 align:start position:0%
your hand up was this the amendment one
 
02:51:40.309 --> 02:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
you had an amendment on or is that
 
02:51:40.319 --> 02:51:43.550 align:start position:0%
you had an amendment on or is that
something

02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:46.150 --> 02:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
else I didn't have my hand up yet but
 
02:51:47.710 --> 02:51:47.720 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to speak you had your hand
 
02:51:49.269 --> 02:51:49.279 align:start position:0%
up initially so I wasn't sure if this
 
02:51:52.550 --> 02:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
was the one
 
02:51:52.560 --> 02:51:56.389 align:start position:0%
was the one
um

02:51:56.389 --> 02:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:59.590 --> 02:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
so so I did uh have an amendment written
 
02:52:02.710 --> 02:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
to just um decrease the amount of money
 
02:52:05.950 --> 02:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
but um even before we got to this
 
02:52:07.830 --> 02:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
discussion I decided that that was
 
02:52:10.870 --> 02:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
probably not the best way to go and what
 
02:52:15.670 --> 02:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
I was hoping for today was that um
 
02:52:19.510 --> 02:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
we would put off um executing this bill
 
02:52:22.269 --> 02:52:22.279 align:start position:0%
for a couple of weeks because there have
 
02:52:25.630 --> 02:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
been ongoing discussions with some
 
02:52:28.630 --> 02:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
people um with stakeholders and people
 
02:52:32.710 --> 02:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
in DHHS to solve some issues that I
 
02:52:36.269 --> 02:52:36.279 align:start position:0%
think are real issues in this bill um
 
02:52:39.110 --> 02:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
however I I don't
 
02:52:41.990 --> 02:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
think those discussions would address
 
02:52:44.110 --> 02:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
the concerns that the people who have
 
02:52:47.110 --> 02:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
spoken so far so there kind of an impass
 
02:52:50.070 --> 02:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
here and I'm trying to figure out what I
 
02:52:53.269 --> 02:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
think here I I will say what some of
 
02:52:55.670 --> 02:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
those discussions involved um they
 
02:52:58.030 --> 02:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
involved the total amount of money which
 
02:53:02.309 --> 02:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
I think was not um was um probably
 
02:53:04.790 --> 02:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
pretty random when it was first written
 
02:53:09.590 --> 02:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
into the bill um and that
 
02:53:12.870 --> 02:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
um that further discussions about the
 
02:53:14.750 --> 02:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
full amount of money that this would
 
02:53:17.349 --> 02:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
take to put in this fund which would be
 
02:53:23.070 --> 02:53:23.080 align:start position:0%
an ongoing fund um um which is what um
 
02:53:24.910 --> 02:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
representative Leon seems to be in
 
02:53:28.590 --> 02:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
disagreement with um so one concern that
 
02:53:29.950 --> 02:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
I thought we could address if we had
 
02:53:33.389 --> 02:53:33.399 align:start position:0%
more time was the amount of money also
 
02:53:36.030 --> 02:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if everyone got it but
 
02:53:37.790 --> 02:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
the original Bill didn't have a fiscal
 
02:53:41.750 --> 02:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
note and then we um we got a fiscal note
 
02:53:44.389 --> 02:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
um so there's also a part-time position
 
02:53:49.710 --> 02:53:49.720 align:start position:0%
within DHHS that would um result as a
 
02:53:53.389 --> 02:53:53.399 align:start position:0%
would be a result of this program and um
 
02:53:54.990 --> 02:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
there needed to be further discussions
 
02:53:57.190 --> 02:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
about that how that position would
 
02:54:01.429 --> 02:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
actually be funded um and also there's
 
02:54:03.910 --> 02:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
been talk about how to develop further
 
02:54:07.309 --> 02:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
guard rails in this bill in terms
 
02:54:09.190 --> 02:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
of what
 
02:54:12.150 --> 02:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
activities are legitimate activities for
 
02:54:15.910 --> 02:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
this program and how it's decided who
 
02:54:18.990 --> 02:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
gets them who gets them funded and is
 
02:54:21.630 --> 02:54:21.640 align:start position:0%
there a cap on the on the funding of you
 
02:54:25.150 --> 02:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
know individual um a cap on for the
 
02:54:27.229 --> 02:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
individual's amount of activities that
 
02:54:29.590 --> 02:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
are funded so these are all like
 
02:54:32.309 --> 02:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
questions that I think um if we had a
 
02:54:35.429 --> 02:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
few more weeks we could improve the bill
 
02:54:38.429 --> 02:54:38.439 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure they would address the
 
02:54:40.710 --> 02:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
um the issues that we've been speaking
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
about in here
 
02:54:46.870 --> 02:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
so unless there's some appetite for um
 
02:54:50.469 --> 02:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
continuing this exec session I would
 
02:54:52.429 --> 02:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of the bill I would vote
 
02:54:54.910 --> 02:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as is it's not my
 
02:54:57.030 --> 02:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
preference but that's what I would do
 
02:54:59.030 --> 02:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
02:55:02.510 --> 02:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'd be willing to serve on a
 
02:55:04.510 --> 02:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to try and um look at this
 
02:55:06.870 --> 02:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
and try and figure out if we can find a
 
02:55:08.590 --> 02:55:08.600 align:start position:0%
solution that satisfies everybody or at
 
02:55:10.349 --> 02:55:10.359 align:start position:0%
least get closer to a solution that
 
02:55:12.870 --> 02:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
satisfies everybody um and I know I
 
02:55:15.070 --> 02:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
didn't make the initial motion but um if
 
02:55:16.590 --> 02:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
the chair wanted to put that together
 
02:55:18.190 --> 02:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
and then maybe move this to the 14th
 
02:55:20.070 --> 02:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
when we moved the other early bills
 
02:55:21.710 --> 02:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
which is the hard deadline since it is
 
02:55:23.990 --> 02:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
an early bill um i' I'd be willing to
 
02:55:26.229 --> 02:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
withdraw my second if that was the case
 
02:55:28.870 --> 02:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel I totally agree
 
02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
with that I think this is a really
 
02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
important issue um and I more than happy
 
02:55:34.950 --> 02:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
to withdraw my
 
02:55:38.269 --> 02:55:38.279 align:start position:0%
motion in favor of so you're withdrawing
 
02:55:41.150 --> 02:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
your your motion what's that you moved
 
02:55:44.269 --> 02:55:44.279 align:start position:0%
aop itl so you Mo removing your
 
02:55:46.429 --> 02:55:46.439 align:start position:0%
withdrawing a motion yes and
 
02:55:48.510 --> 02:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
representative Leon is withdrawing her
 
02:55:51.870 --> 02:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
second so at this point we will continue
 
02:55:55.349 --> 02:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
this bill to February 14th when we uh
 
02:55:57.349 --> 02:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
we've already continued one bill to that
 
02:55:59.910 --> 02:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
point also and we will have an executive
 
02:56:02.830 --> 02:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
session that day so so we won't we'll
 
02:56:07.150 --> 02:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
take no action on 1593 FN at this
 
02:56:11.389 --> 02:56:11.399 align:start position:0%
time all right moving on uh HB 1612
 
02:56:13.269 --> 02:56:13.279 align:start position:0%
representative Lon uh thank you Mr
 
02:56:16.110 --> 02:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd move I L on this bill he is
 
02:56:19.750 --> 02:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
there a second second representative
 
02:56:21.349 --> 02:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
Missour I think beat representative
 
02:56:23.389 --> 02:56:23.399 align:start position:0%
Merchant to it okay do you want to speak
 
02:56:25.309 --> 02:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
to your motion representative Lon uh yes
 
02:56:27.309 --> 02:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I think that
 
02:56:29.670 --> 02:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
being aware of the status of our error
 
02:56:32.190 --> 02:56:32.200 align:start position:0%
in radio any radio activity is highly
 
02:56:34.229 --> 02:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
crucial um but I think that with the
 
02:56:36.110 --> 02:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
existence of the C10 Network and the
 
02:56:37.830 --> 02:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
ability that people are already doing
 
02:56:39.389 --> 02:56:39.399 align:start position:0%
this I think that the more important way
 
02:56:41.070 --> 02:56:41.080 align:start position:0%
to do this would be to plug into the
 
02:56:43.070 --> 02:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
work that is already being done as
 
02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to trying to reinvent the wheel
 
02:56:47.269 --> 02:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
um I reached out to the department to
 
02:56:49.070 --> 02:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
see if they needed any authorization to
 
02:56:51.910 --> 02:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
participate in something like this and
 
02:56:54.550 --> 02:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
um I was referred back to the testimony
 
02:56:56.190 --> 02:56:56.200 align:start position:0%
from C10 that said that they're working
 
02:56:58.190 --> 02:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
to figure out how they would work with
 
02:57:00.349 --> 02:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire in order to
 
02:57:02.670 --> 02:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
do this um generally we're not in the
 
02:57:05.269 --> 02:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
business of micromanaging departmental
 
02:57:08.030 --> 02:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
decisions and um I don't see any
 
02:57:10.030 --> 02:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
indications that they would necessarily
 
02:57:12.389 --> 02:57:12.399 align:start position:0%
need any stat any uh legislative
 
02:57:15.710 --> 02:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
approval to um working a contract with
 
02:57:18.030 --> 02:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
them um as far as I believe I believe
 
02:57:19.550 --> 02:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
most of the contracts if they're large
 
02:57:21.910 --> 02:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
enough go through the executive counsil
 
02:57:24.429 --> 02:57:24.439 align:start position:0%
because it is an executive dep executive
 
02:57:27.590 --> 02:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
agency um and so for that reason I
 
02:57:30.030 --> 02:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
encourage the department to work with
 
02:57:32.670 --> 02:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
C10 or anybody else who is trying to get
 
02:57:34.590 --> 02:57:34.600 align:start position:0%
alerts on the radio activity in that
 
02:57:36.229 --> 02:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
area so that we can know when there's a
 
02:57:38.710 --> 02:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
real response and know when there's just
 
02:57:41.030 --> 02:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who hit the wrong button and is
 
02:57:42.510 --> 02:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
somebody who hit the wrong button and
 
02:57:44.790 --> 02:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
lost $80,000 when I was trading for my
 
02:57:47.790 --> 02:57:47.800 align:start position:0%
company I recognize the harm in that but
 
02:57:49.309 --> 02:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
I'd say the harm of everybody thinking
 
02:57:51.070 --> 02:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
there was a leak at seab Brook was far
 
02:57:53.150 --> 02:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
worse than my mistake on the trading
 
02:57:55.950 --> 02:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
floor um but I'd like us to just um do I
 
02:57:57.990 --> 02:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
move and go itl on this bill and
 
02:58:00.269 --> 02:58:00.279 align:start position:0%
encourage the department to work towards
 
02:58:02.229 --> 02:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
a collaboration and then come back to us
 
02:58:04.550 --> 02:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
with anything they need if it's
 
02:58:06.670 --> 02:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
needed representative M did you want to
 
02:58:09.670 --> 02:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
speak to you a second or no okay repres
 
02:58:11.670 --> 02:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
anyone else want to
 
02:58:14.150 --> 02:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
speak representative uh representative
 
02:58:16.630 --> 02:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
Nagel and then representative Shapiro I
 
02:58:18.750 --> 02:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
just have a quick comment I mean I was
 
02:58:21.190 --> 02:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
struck when um the person was giving the
 
02:58:23.590 --> 02:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
testimony from C10 was giving a
 
02:58:25.670 --> 02:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
beautiful eloquent testimony that was
 
02:58:27.790 --> 02:58:27.800 align:start position:0%
going on and on and somebody asked her
 
02:58:29.309 --> 02:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
what do you think about the bill and she
 
02:58:31.910 --> 02:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
said I think it's Dead on Arrival and
 
02:58:33.830 --> 02:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
that totally swayed me that was all I
 
02:58:35.030 --> 02:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
needed to
 
02:58:37.309 --> 02:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
hear representative
 
02:58:40.229 --> 02:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman um first
 
02:58:41.750 --> 02:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
of all I would love to hear the story
 
02:58:44.429 --> 02:58:44.439 align:start position:0%
about pushing the wrong button um
 
02:58:47.790 --> 02:58:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:51.510 --> 02:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
um I just want to I I will I will vote
 
02:58:55.030 --> 02:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
for itl I think that um it's not clear
 
02:58:57.030 --> 02:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
to me that there's not a problem that
 
02:58:59.590 --> 02:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
could be addressed through some changes
 
02:59:01.750 --> 02:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
but it likewise it's not clear to me
 
02:59:03.910 --> 02:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
that there is a problem and I think the
 
02:59:06.229 --> 02:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
fact that the sponsor of the bill didn't
 
02:59:08.070 --> 02:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
come to the wasn't able to come or
 
02:59:11.469 --> 02:59:11.479 align:start position:0%
didn't come to the hearing and there was
 
02:59:16.349 --> 02:59:16.359 align:start position:0%
uh a letter by the person who did um
 
02:59:18.590 --> 02:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
Inspire this bill and they didn't come
 
02:59:20.990 --> 02:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
to the hearing I think they just we're
 
02:59:24.910 --> 02:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
left without any specificity about why
 
02:59:28.030 --> 02:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
the why the added monitoring is needed
 
02:59:31.790 --> 02:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
and what the added monitoring means and
 
02:59:36.870 --> 02:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
the financial note was quite Hefty and
 
02:59:39.269 --> 02:59:39.279 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if there's a problem but
 
02:59:40.950 --> 02:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
if there is a problem it doesn't seem
 
02:59:43.030 --> 02:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
like this bill is the way to um solve
 
02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:47.990 --> 02:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
any other
 
02:59:49.910 --> 02:59:49.920 align:start position:0%

yes has everybody had a chance to read
 
03:02:50.750 --> 03:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
it okay does everybody have a copy of it
 
03:02:53.150 --> 03:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
okay um if I may just start by
 
03:02:54.830 --> 03:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
introducing what the change is so that
 
03:02:57.750 --> 03:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
everybody can read it um I'll then pause
 
03:03:00.550 --> 03:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
um so the the first sentence in Section
 
03:03:03.830 --> 03:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
8 is inserted was already in the bill um
 
03:03:05.590 --> 03:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
the addition of the line This
 
03:03:07.150 --> 03:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
prohibition shall not restrict the
 
03:03:09.550 --> 03:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
ability of employees of said Department
 
03:03:11.110 --> 03:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
from serving as foster parents for
 
03:03:12.389 --> 03:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
children for whom they had no
 
03:03:14.190 --> 03:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
involvement in the removal of placement
 
03:03:16.510 --> 03:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
process um was what I believe to be
 
03:03:18.190 --> 03:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
consistent with the discussion in
 
03:03:20.110 --> 03:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
clarification between the sponsor and
 
03:03:21.830 --> 03:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
the concerns of the department so I'll
 
03:03:23.229 --> 03:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
let everybody read through that again
 
03:03:24.750 --> 03:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
and sort of signal to me when you're
 
03:03:42.469 --> 03:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:42.479 --> 03:04:19.429 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

03:04:19.429 --> 03:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:21.150 --> 03:04:21.160 align:start position:0%

waiting so much for the depart for the

not intended as uh as trying to pull
 
03:04:35.870 --> 03:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
anything off I was just trying to get
 
03:04:37.429 --> 03:04:37.439 align:start position:0%
the amendment drafted and it was my
 
03:04:39.670 --> 03:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
oversight to not mention it before we
 
03:04:42.030 --> 03:04:42.040 align:start position:0%

03:04:47.469 --> 03:04:47.479 align:start position:0%

keep any conflict of interest out of
 
03:07:11.110 --> 03:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
these very important situations where
 
03:07:13.790 --> 03:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
we're placing kids um
 
03:07:17.070 --> 03:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
where we are um involved in removing
 
03:07:19.229 --> 03:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
them from the home we just want to make
 
03:07:22.110 --> 03:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
sure that there's no um competing

very Hefty fin uh fiscal note but this
 
03:07:41.510 --> 03:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note appears to be entirely
 
03:07:45.110 --> 03:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
related to the concern that the the the
 
03:07:47.309 --> 03:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
employees of the Departments would be
 
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
removed from consideration in foster
 
03:07:51.670 --> 03:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
care and then the cost of filling the
 
03:07:55.030 --> 03:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
gap of those 10 employees the 1.8% of
 
03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
foster families in the state being
 
03:07:59.790 --> 03:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
removed from that system um this I
 
03:08:01.349 --> 03:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
believe that this amendment makes that
 
03:08:04.030 --> 03:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
clear and this bill is a second
 
03:08:05.910 --> 03:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
committee bill that I'm pretty certain
 
03:08:07.590 --> 03:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's a second committee bill and if not
 
03:08:09.590 --> 03:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
we can request that it U be referred to
 
03:08:12.469 --> 03:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
finance but we can ask for um there's
 
03:08:14.030 --> 03:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
already been a request for a new fiscal
 
03:08:16.349 --> 03:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
analysis without including the F the
 
03:08:18.990 --> 03:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
change to the Foster families um I don't
 
03:08:21.630 --> 03:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
see any fiscal language surrounding
 
03:08:23.309 --> 03:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
anything other than the removal of those
 
03:08:25.750 --> 03:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
employees from the Foster family pool
 
03:08:27.070 --> 03:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
and as such I don't think that there's
 
03:08:29.550 --> 03:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
actually a fiscal um impact I'll check
 
03:08:31.550 --> 03:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
my notes to see if this is an early bill
 
03:08:33.110 --> 03:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
or not but I think that's why we heard
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
it um so quickly and um with that I'll
 
03:08:38.309 --> 03:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
yield to anybody else representative
 
03:08:40.870 --> 03:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
Seth King thank you Mr chair uh I
 
03:08:44.389 --> 03:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
support the a to pass motion um I agree
 
03:08:46.150 --> 03:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
that we don't want the fox guarding the
 
03:08:49.309 --> 03:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
hen house and one thing to consider is
 
03:08:53.950 --> 03:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
that if this were private ecosystem um
 
03:08:55.630 --> 03:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
this would potentially be considered a
 
03:08:59.510 --> 03:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
monopoly the idea of the same company I
 
03:09:00.550 --> 03:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
mean we're not dealing with a company
 
03:09:02.229 --> 03:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
here but if we had a company that was in
 
03:09:04.550 --> 03:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
the process of taking children from
 
03:09:07.469 --> 03:09:07.479 align:start position:0%
families and the same company involved
 
03:09:09.590 --> 03:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
in redistributing those children that
 
03:09:11.190 --> 03:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
would probably be a monopoly that would
 
03:09:14.150 --> 03:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
be broken up by us so if you don't
 
03:09:16.750 --> 03:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
support that sort of
 
03:09:20.309 --> 03:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
monopolistic uh private Venture then I
 
03:09:22.070 --> 03:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
would say you probably shouldn't support
 
03:09:25.190 --> 03:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
the idea that uh in this case the same
 
03:09:27.349 --> 03:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
people um that are involved in the
 
03:09:28.990 --> 03:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
breaking up of families are also
 
03:09:30.510 --> 03:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
involved in the redistribution of
 
03:09:32.830 --> 03:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
children that just seems it just seems
 
03:09:34.790 --> 03:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
like a conflict of interest and we
 
03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't tolerate it in other aspects of
 
03:09:37.990 --> 03:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
society we probably shouldn't do it here
 
03:09:40.630 --> 03:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
either thank you this is an early bill
 
03:09:42.070 --> 03:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
by the way and we'll be going to finance
 
03:09:45.190 --> 03:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
should the House pass representative
 
03:09:48.349 --> 03:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes I'm adamantly opposed to
 
03:09:52.150 --> 03:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and so I'll vote against
 
03:09:52.160 --> 03:09:54.670 align:start position:0%
this bill and so I'll vote against
otpa

03:09:54.670 --> 03:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
otpa
 
03:09:57.349 --> 03:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
um when the sponsor presented the bill
 
03:10:00.950 --> 03:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
he said he was aware of no problems um
 
03:10:07.389 --> 03:10:07.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:10.710 --> 03:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
um that where this had actually occurred
 
03:10:15.469 --> 03:10:15.479 align:start position:0%
so this seems to be um of bill that is a
 
03:10:18.790 --> 03:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
a solution looking for a problem
 
03:10:18.800 --> 03:10:20.790 align:start position:0%
a solution looking for a problem
um

03:10:20.790 --> 03:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:20.800 --> 03:10:25.110 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:10:25.110 --> 03:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:27.389 --> 03:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
secondly when we're talking about
 
03:10:29.150 --> 03:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
children being removed from their
 
03:10:32.950 --> 03:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
families by DCF in particular um they're
 
03:10:35.030 --> 03:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
not Avail they're not available to be
 
03:10:36.550 --> 03:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
adopted because they've been put in
 
03:10:39.429 --> 03:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
force to care or quotes removed from
 
03:10:43.030 --> 03:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
their family but if they if they become
 
03:10:45.910 --> 03:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
um eligible for adoption because the
 
03:10:48.389 --> 03:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
parents rights have been terminated in
 
03:10:51.750 --> 03:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
court or or voluntarily um they would be
 
03:10:54.750 --> 03:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
adopted directly through DCF they
 
03:10:59.030 --> 03:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be adopted through a
 
03:11:02.510 --> 03:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
a a licensed adoption and child placing
 
03:11:06.190 --> 03:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
agency so I think the the um conflict
 
03:11:09.630 --> 03:11:09.640 align:start position:0%
that is alluded to with people um being
 
03:11:12.349 --> 03:11:12.359 align:start position:0%
incentivized to take children and make
 
03:11:17.550 --> 03:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
them a aailable for adoption um and
 
03:11:20.510 --> 03:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
then switching job roles and then
 
03:11:22.349 --> 03:11:22.359 align:start position:0%
adopting them out for some kind of
 
03:11:25.269 --> 03:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
profit is is not really real we're
 
03:11:26.710 --> 03:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
talking about something that's not
 
03:11:29.790 --> 03:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
really real I think this is a slippery
 
03:11:34.389 --> 03:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
slope in terms of saying what kinds of
 
03:11:38.670 --> 03:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
um jobs people can hold as well as their
 
03:11:40.870 --> 03:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know as well as their nine-to-five
 
03:11:45.630 --> 03:11:45.640 align:start position:0%
job um and I think this is kind of a um
 
03:11:47.830 --> 03:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
a cynical view of humanity that we
 
03:11:52.429 --> 03:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
shouldn't support um that
 
03:11:56.110 --> 03:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
um that people are
 
03:11:58.990 --> 03:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
um going to be incentivized to
 
03:12:00.990 --> 03:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
essentially steal people's children so
 
03:12:02.830 --> 03:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
they can make a few bucks by adopting
 
03:12:05.550 --> 03:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
them out to someone I think that's a a a
 
03:12:07.830 --> 03:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
view of humanity that I don't want to
 
03:12:12.269 --> 03:12:12.279 align:start position:0%
support um I also think that this is um
 
03:12:14.950 --> 03:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
just more big government of like making
 
03:12:16.510 --> 03:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
you know I'm always amazed that there
 
03:12:19.710 --> 03:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
are a thousand bills put forward in our
 
03:12:23.269 --> 03:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
legislature um and frequently people on
 
03:12:25.190 --> 03:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
both sides of the aisle depending on
 
03:12:27.190 --> 03:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
what the bill is say we have too many
 
03:12:30.269 --> 03:12:30.279 align:start position:0%
laws well I think this is one too many
 
03:12:32.550 --> 03:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
laws so I'm going to vote against
 
03:12:35.349 --> 03:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative Leon um
 
03:12:37.349 --> 03:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um there are many
 
03:12:38.990 --> 03:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
lines of work in which there are
 
03:12:41.990 --> 03:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
employment restrictions about what other
 
03:12:43.910 --> 03:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
jobs and what other secondary jobs would
 
03:12:46.229 --> 03:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
be a conflict with their with the
 
03:12:49.429 --> 03:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
current or main employment um as the
 
03:12:52.030 --> 03:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is the employer
 
03:12:53.469 --> 03:12:53.479 align:start position:0%
for people at the Department of Health
 
03:12:55.229 --> 03:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and the department of
 
03:12:57.590 --> 03:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
children and children and uh Family
 
03:13:00.590 --> 03:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
Services uh because of that the only way
 
03:13:02.469 --> 03:13:02.479 align:start position:0%
to change the terms one of the ways to
 
03:13:04.510 --> 03:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
change the terms of employment is
 
03:13:06.349 --> 03:13:06.359 align:start position:0%
through changing the laws surrounding
 
03:13:09.510 --> 03:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
what is permissible for those employees
 
03:13:13.550 --> 03:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh so the only the this isn't growing
 
03:13:15.670 --> 03:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
government this is putting a check on
 
03:13:17.870 --> 03:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
government and um I would be quite
 
03:13:20.309 --> 03:13:20.319 align:start position:0%
thankful to hear that this is not needed
 
03:13:22.229 --> 03:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
but you know we're always told what do
 
03:13:23.790 --> 03:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
we need to do if it can save just one
 
03:13:26.510 --> 03:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
child this is one of those areas where
 
03:13:28.630 --> 03:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
it just simply would remove people's
 
03:13:31.630 --> 03:13:31.640 align:start position:0%
concern that this is an issue this is
 
03:13:34.830 --> 03:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
something that is limiting the state and
 
03:13:36.950 --> 03:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
as such I think that it is reasonable to
 
03:13:39.429 --> 03:13:39.439 align:start position:0%
move on to the next step of the process
 
03:13:40.630 --> 03:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and then
 
03:13:42.630 --> 03:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you thank
 
03:13:43.510 --> 03:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
03:13:46.229 --> 03:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
chair first I want to commend the author
 
03:13:48.030 --> 03:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
of the amendment for drafting the
 
03:13:49.349 --> 03:13:49.359 align:start position:0%
amendment I think it's a step in the
 
03:13:50.670 --> 03:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
right direction but unfortunately it's
 
03:13:54.910 --> 03:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
not far enough um when I thought about
 
03:13:58.510 --> 03:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
the issue of someone trying to cook the
 
03:14:01.630 --> 03:14:01.640 align:start position:0%
books if you will to try to get a child
 
03:14:03.429 --> 03:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
away from their parents to put them up
 
03:14:03.439 --> 03:14:04.750 align:start position:0%
away from their parents to put them up
for

03:14:04.750 --> 03:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:14:07.030 --> 03:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
adoption what I have to realizes that
 
03:14:08.550 --> 03:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
can't be done without a
 
03:14:11.309 --> 03:14:11.319 align:start position:0%
court so there's a court involved here
 
03:14:14.190 --> 03:14:14.200 align:start position:0%
folks that that court is the one who
 
03:14:16.910 --> 03:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
decides to take parents rights away not
 
03:14:20.590 --> 03:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
the DCF or anyone else so even if they
 
03:14:23.229 --> 03:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to do this it could not happen
 
03:14:26.269 --> 03:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
without the blessing of a court so
 
03:14:29.950 --> 03:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
therefore I think baral's point of view
 
03:14:33.229 --> 03:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
we have a solution looking for a problem
 
03:14:35.030 --> 03:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
there is no evidence in the state of New
 
03:14:37.990 --> 03:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that this actually exist so
 
03:14:41.469 --> 03:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
why are we penalizing a group of
 
03:14:43.550 --> 03:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
employees and putting restrictions on
 
03:14:45.870 --> 03:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
their employment when a there's been no
 
03:14:49.469 --> 03:14:49.479 align:start position:0%
evidence that we need it and B if there
 
03:14:52.190 --> 03:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
was you still have to go to court the
 
03:14:53.990 --> 03:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
judge still has to waigh on it you
 
03:14:56.389 --> 03:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
cannot take parents rights away without
 
03:14:57.790 --> 03:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
the blessing of the court so therefore I
 
03:15:01.190 --> 03:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
will not support the bills amended thank
 
03:15:03.110 --> 03:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
you representative Seth King and then
 
03:15:05.229 --> 03:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
representative kosman thank you again Mr
 
03:15:07.229 --> 03:15:07.239 align:start position:0%
chair uh to address representative
 
03:15:10.389 --> 03:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
Merchants concerns um that the the court
 
03:15:13.990 --> 03:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
would be the Arbiter here uh that's true
 
03:15:16.950 --> 03:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
but let's not forget that the
 
03:15:19.349 --> 03:15:19.359 align:start position:0%
information that the court gets is from
 
03:15:20.710 --> 03:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
employees of
 
03:15:25.830 --> 03:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
dcyf and if their if their judgment is
 
03:15:29.070 --> 03:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
is Tainted by ulterior motives then the
 
03:15:30.790 --> 03:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
court is going to get bad information
 
03:15:34.349 --> 03:15:34.359 align:start position:0%
from dcyf so uh the court may help
 
03:15:36.110 --> 03:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
prevent some things like that and that's
 
03:15:38.590 --> 03:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
nice but the problem is is lots of times
 
03:15:40.990 --> 03:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to children it's a he said
 
03:15:43.389 --> 03:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
she said thing and it's just it's just
 
03:15:46.030 --> 03:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
extremely powerful the the the amount of
 
03:15:48.670 --> 03:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
power the dcyf employees have um and
 
03:15:50.750 --> 03:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
then also I wanted to just piggyback a
 
03:15:52.229 --> 03:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
little bit on representative Lon said
 
03:15:53.750 --> 03:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of positions when you
 
03:15:54.830 --> 03:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
work for the government you're not
 
03:15:56.550 --> 03:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
allowed to simultaneously work for those
 
03:15:58.349 --> 03:15:58.359 align:start position:0%
you regulate you know we wouldn't want
 
03:15:59.990 --> 03:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
people that work for the dod to also
 
03:16:01.950 --> 03:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
work for Ron we wouldn't want the people
 
03:16:04.229 --> 03:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
that work for the SEC to also work for
 
03:16:06.269 --> 03:16:06.279 align:start position:0%
Goldman Sachs matter of fact there's a
 
03:16:08.429 --> 03:16:08.439 align:start position:0%
lot of talk on both sides of the aisle
 
03:16:10.150 --> 03:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
not just Republicans both sides of the
 
03:16:12.189 --> 03:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
aisle that we're even starting to say
 
03:16:13.550 --> 03:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
hey you know what not only can you not
 
03:16:16.110 --> 03:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
work simultaneously you shouldn't be
 
03:16:19.030 --> 03:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to work 10 years after if you
 
03:16:20.750 --> 03:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
leave the SEC you don't get to work for
 
03:16:22.830 --> 03:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
Goldman Sachs because there could be Pro
 
03:16:25.510 --> 03:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
quid you know quote um I always mess up
 
03:16:29.110 --> 03:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
the Latin Pro quid quid pro quot going
 
03:16:33.590 --> 03:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
on where you know um it you you you are
 
03:16:36.429 --> 03:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
the regulator but behind the scenes
 
03:16:38.349 --> 03:16:38.359 align:start position:0%
you're going to regulate in favor of the
 
03:16:39.750 --> 03:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
big corporations and then you're going
 
03:16:41.349 --> 03:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
to turn around and work for them after
 
03:16:44.590 --> 03:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
you quit I mean that does happen all the
 
03:16:47.189 --> 03:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
time and both sides of the aisle are not
 
03:16:50.229 --> 03:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
happy about that so um yes it is a
 
03:16:52.790 --> 03:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
cynical view of humanity and I'm a cynic
 
03:16:55.269 --> 03:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
okay people are people are that
 
03:16:57.550 --> 03:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
corrupt so that's why I'm supporting
 
03:16:59.389 --> 03:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you representative
 
03:17:03.389 --> 03:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
kosman thank you Mr chairman so I have
 
03:17:07.189 --> 03:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
been experiencing a crash course in DCF
 
03:17:09.110 --> 03:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
and family court over the last several
 
03:17:11.990 --> 03:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
months I watched all of the hearings on
 
03:17:16.710 --> 03:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
the special committee um on the Family
 
03:17:20.870 --> 03:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
Court uh division of circuit court and
 
03:17:24.790 --> 03:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
there were many meetings and much of the
 
03:17:29.030 --> 03:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
testimony was about the fact that DCF
 
03:17:30.389 --> 03:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
and the family
 
03:17:34.910 --> 03:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
courts do not operate in a fair or
 
03:17:37.710 --> 03:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
non-arbitrary manner there are many
 
03:17:39.830 --> 03:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
reasons for that I won't get into all
 
03:17:42.870 --> 03:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
the details but the judges have full
 
03:17:47.790 --> 03:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
discretion to accept evidence or not so
 
03:17:49.189 --> 03:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
if you bring affidavits from all your
 
03:17:51.990 --> 03:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
friends that you're a good mom and dcyf
 
03:17:55.429 --> 03:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
brings a finding of abuse the judge will
 
03:17:57.790 --> 03:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
throw out your affidavits or not even
 
03:17:58.710 --> 03:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
look at
 
03:18:02.510 --> 03:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
them and they will take dcf's orders as
 
03:18:05.550 --> 03:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
sacrosanct and rubber stamp it and it's
 
03:18:07.990 --> 03:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
not all the judges and some of it's
 
03:18:10.469 --> 03:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
incompetence but some of it there's
 
03:18:11.950 --> 03:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
really a lot of evidence that there is a
 
03:18:16.790 --> 03:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
lot lot of very deep corruption and
 
03:18:19.750 --> 03:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm treading carefully
 
03:18:23.630 --> 03:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
but just the assumption that everybody
 
03:18:27.030 --> 03:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
is good and will do the right
 
03:18:29.429 --> 03:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
thing um is
 
03:18:31.710 --> 03:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
a understand there it's understandable
 
03:18:35.510 --> 03:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
why we'd want to assume that but as I
 
03:18:37.830 --> 03:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
grow over older I find more and more
 
03:18:41.349 --> 03:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
that it can be the other way especially
 
03:18:42.790 --> 03:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
when you have people in positions of
 
03:18:46.269 --> 03:18:46.279 align:start position:0%
authority and you give them power power
 
03:18:48.429 --> 03:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
corrupts representative Merchant then
 
03:18:51.750 --> 03:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative blon thank you Mr
 
03:18:55.030 --> 03:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
chair if the issue is the
 
03:18:59.229 --> 03:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
courts and the courts being not true
 
03:18:59.239 --> 03:19:00.469 align:start position:0%
courts and the courts being not true
neutral

03:19:00.469 --> 03:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
03:19:02.750 --> 03:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
arbitrators is that not where we need to
 
03:19:04.990 --> 03:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
go versus doing something of this nature
 
03:19:06.950 --> 03:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
and talk about where the problem is
 
03:19:09.189 --> 03:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
versus trying to solve something without
 
03:19:10.910 --> 03:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
getting to the problem and that's what
 
03:19:13.309 --> 03:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get to so therefore again
 
03:19:15.030 --> 03:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
back to your
 
03:19:17.990 --> 03:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
comment if in fact the courts are not
 
03:19:20.269 --> 03:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
being neutral the courts are taking
 
03:19:22.389 --> 03:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
one-sided in leaning one way or the
 
03:19:24.269 --> 03:19:24.279 align:start position:0%
other I think the appropriate place to
 
03:19:26.950 --> 03:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
go in a legislative process is dealing
 
03:19:31.429 --> 03:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:35.030 --> 03:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
here representative kosman thank you Mr
 
03:19:37.269 --> 03:19:37.279 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'm assuming the question
 
03:19:39.990 --> 03:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
was directed toward me um I I agree we
 
03:19:42.110 --> 03:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
do need definitely there's like massive
 
03:19:43.429 --> 03:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
overhaul that needs to take place in the
 
03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
courts but there's also massive overhaul
 
03:19:47.469 --> 03:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
that needs to take place within DCF
 
03:19:49.630 --> 03:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
processes as well and this bill is the
 
03:19:52.030 --> 03:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
first step the first you know place that
 
03:19:55.070 --> 03:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
we've Unearthed an issue um and that we
 
03:19:56.469 --> 03:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
want to get ahead of and make sure that
 
03:19:58.189 --> 03:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
it it can happen thank you
 
03:20:00.269 --> 03:20:00.279 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
03:20:02.910 --> 03:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
chairman um right now the standards to
 
03:20:04.750 --> 03:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
remove a child from the home aren what
 
03:20:07.229 --> 03:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
they are but there is a bill um that is
 
03:20:08.950 --> 03:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
active in the other body that would
 
03:20:11.189 --> 03:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
include somebody something like uh
 
03:20:13.710 --> 03:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
somebody dis ageing with the level of
 
03:20:16.389 --> 03:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
cleanliness in your house um I'm sorry
 
03:20:18.030 --> 03:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
but I have three boys the whole saying
 
03:20:19.790 --> 03:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
is your house will be clean when the
 
03:20:22.670 --> 03:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
kids leave the house and that sub the
 
03:20:25.070 --> 03:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
potential subjectivity about the state
 
03:20:26.990 --> 03:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
of somebody's housekeeping or
 
03:20:29.189 --> 03:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
disagreeing with the education that's
 
03:20:32.429 --> 03:20:32.439 align:start position:0%
provided to other children um that other
 
03:20:33.750 --> 03:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
the bill that's pending in the other
 
03:20:35.990 --> 03:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
body could make things so much more
 
03:20:38.189 --> 03:20:38.199 align:start position:0%
subjective within the department that
 
03:20:40.389 --> 03:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
that actually would give us more reasons
 
03:20:42.110 --> 03:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
um why it's more important to as
 
03:20:44.030 --> 03:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
employers set this condition of
 
03:20:46.110 --> 03:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
employment um you know hopefully that'll
 
03:20:47.590 --> 03:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
be addressed and if it comes our way
 
03:20:49.070 --> 03:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
we'll deal with it as well but I just
 
03:20:51.710 --> 03:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise people's um awareness
 
03:20:53.710 --> 03:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
that that this may be moving into a more
 
03:20:56.590 --> 03:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
subjective way so if we do end up
 
03:20:59.670 --> 03:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
enabling to have more subjective choices
 
03:21:01.670 --> 03:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
in which children are removed you know
 
03:21:03.910 --> 03:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
in Wake of the ab absolute Horrors that
 
03:21:06.510 --> 03:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
we witnessed in recent years um that we
 
03:21:08.510 --> 03:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
also have this Safeguard too that we
 
03:21:10.429 --> 03:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
don't potentially experience some of the
 
03:21:12.429 --> 03:21:12.439 align:start position:0%
horrors within the department that have
 
03:21:14.630 --> 03:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
happened in other states you know I'd
 
03:21:15.990 --> 03:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
love to think the best of my fellow
 
03:21:17.910 --> 03:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters but you know sometimes
 
03:21:19.990 --> 03:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
we need to figure out where to draw that
 
03:21:22.870 --> 03:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
line other discussion representative hen
 
03:21:26.110 --> 03:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
Phillips thank you Mr chair um I just
 
03:21:29.870 --> 03:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to take a moment to address um um
 
03:21:31.429 --> 03:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
some allegations that were made in
 
03:21:33.550 --> 03:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
testimony just now from our own members
 
03:21:36.630 --> 03:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
and just um to remind this body that I
 
03:21:38.110 --> 03:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
am a member of the New Hampshire Bar
 
03:21:39.830 --> 03:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
Association I am a licensed and
 
03:21:42.309 --> 03:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
practicing attorney in the state and
 
03:21:44.550 --> 03:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
that um the allegations that I just
 
03:21:47.790 --> 03:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
heard of without any factual evidence
 
03:21:50.030 --> 03:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
that our New Hampshire court system
 
03:21:54.070 --> 03:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
or perhaps our family court system by a
 
03:21:56.670 --> 03:21:56.680 align:start position:0%
non-practicing non-licensed lay person
 
03:21:58.269 --> 03:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
who is also a member of our general
 
03:22:01.189 --> 03:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
court I find to be very
 
03:22:04.110 --> 03:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
disturbing I um would just like to make
 
03:22:05.990 --> 03:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
a mention of The Honorable work that our
 
03:22:08.990 --> 03:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
court system staff and judges do for our
 
03:22:12.070 --> 03:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
state um and that you know they are held
 
03:22:16.150 --> 03:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
to very high standards of constitutional
 
03:22:18.630 --> 03:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
practice and and professional practice
 
03:22:23.469 --> 03:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
codes of conduct that um I believe are
 
03:22:26.550 --> 03:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
held here in our state and that um I
 
03:22:28.630 --> 03:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
would just like to say the substance of
 
03:22:31.189 --> 03:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
this bill does not seem to address the
 
03:22:34.110 --> 03:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
concerns that we've just heard um you
 
03:22:35.790 --> 03:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
know it sounds like there's a procedural
 
03:22:39.389 --> 03:22:39.399 align:start position:0%
evidentiary complaint that someone may
 
03:22:42.510 --> 03:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
have um with the court system but I'll
 
03:22:45.429 --> 03:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
remind this body that our house did in
 
03:22:47.950 --> 03:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
fact just vote on that matter this month
 
03:22:51.950 --> 03:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
and shot it down so um this particular
 
03:22:54.870 --> 03:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
concern does not get addressed by the
 
03:22:57.110 --> 03:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
language of this bill and I would just
 
03:22:59.110 --> 03:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
like to say that
 
03:23:02.830 --> 03:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's our our duty here
 
03:23:04.990 --> 03:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
in in the Health and Human Services
 
03:23:06.670 --> 03:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
committee which I am substituting on
 
03:23:09.150 --> 03:23:09.160 align:start position:0%
today to to try to work on these healthc
 
03:23:12.750 --> 03:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
care issues and um I don't believe that
 
03:23:12.760 --> 03:23:13.550 align:start position:0%
care issues and um I don't believe that
those

03:23:13.550 --> 03:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:23:16.389 --> 03:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
allegations appropriately align with the
 
03:23:17.990 --> 03:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
substance of this bill and for that
 
03:23:20.630 --> 03:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
reason I will be voting against
 
03:23:23.870 --> 03:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
03:23:27.429 --> 03:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
Palmer so my only additional point would
 
03:23:30.309 --> 03:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
be that um normally a conflict of
 
03:23:32.349 --> 03:23:32.359 align:start position:0%
interest kind of thing would be dealt
 
03:23:33.990 --> 03:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
with by
 
03:23:37.510 --> 03:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
the company or the agency so I would
 
03:23:41.469 --> 03:23:41.479 align:start position:0%
much rather see this addressed by HHS as
 
03:23:44.189 --> 03:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
a as an internal policy rather than
 
03:23:47.790 --> 03:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
adding more legislation that takes more
 
03:23:50.550 --> 03:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
legislation to change if it needs to be
 
03:23:52.710 --> 03:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
changed representative
 
03:23:56.110 --> 03:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair um the only
 
03:23:58.429 --> 03:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is that we are seeing
 
03:24:01.429 --> 03:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
in this state in this country um a real
 
03:24:05.070 --> 03:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
decline in the trust of our institutions
 
03:24:07.469 --> 03:24:07.479 align:start position:0%
in general and in this state in
 
03:24:10.269 --> 03:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
particular there is a huge amount of
 
03:24:14.349 --> 03:24:14.359 align:start position:0%
distrust in in in the Family Court um
 
03:24:17.309 --> 03:24:17.319 align:start position:0%
and it's not enough that that the system
 
03:24:20.389 --> 03:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
be fair and the system be just it may
 
03:24:22.590 --> 03:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
very well be but in addition to that
 
03:24:24.950 --> 03:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
there also has to be the perception that
 
03:24:27.710 --> 03:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
the system is fair and just and so I
 
03:24:31.389 --> 03:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
think that um this bill goes a long way
 
03:24:33.510 --> 03:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
towards accomplishing that it this is
 
03:24:36.469 --> 03:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
about also reestablishing trust in the
 
03:24:38.630 --> 03:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
systems and so I will be supporting the
 
03:24:44.309 --> 03:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
bill representative Parmer and I
 
03:24:47.830 --> 03:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
I I guess what I would say is that part
 
03:24:50.349 --> 03:24:50.359 align:start position:0%
of the reason that the trust is slipping
 
03:24:53.630 --> 03:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
is because of the kinds of things we do
 
03:24:55.309 --> 03:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
and I think we need to be very careful
 
03:24:58.950 --> 03:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
that we don't accelerate anything beyond
 
03:25:02.389 --> 03:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate um skepticism of what
 
03:25:05.630 --> 03:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
government is doing um because I think
 
03:25:07.030 --> 03:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
we certainly can make it worse along
 
03:25:08.630 --> 03:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
with the
 
03:25:11.030 --> 03:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
media uh representative Shapero and then
 
03:25:13.070 --> 03:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King then
 
03:25:17.950 --> 03:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:23.469 --> 03:25:23.479 align:start position:0%
was yes as um as I'm hesitant to say
 
03:25:25.309 --> 03:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
this but as someone who's actually
 
03:25:28.510 --> 03:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
worked as a protective so protective
 
03:25:32.630 --> 03:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
services social worker um briefly and
 
03:25:34.710 --> 03:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
earlier in my career and not in New
 
03:25:37.309 --> 03:25:37.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Vermont um but who's
 
03:25:41.150 --> 03:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
actually had that job of um working with
 
03:25:45.429 --> 03:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
family amilies um to assess abuse and
 
03:25:47.910 --> 03:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
neglect and then to get families the
 
03:25:49.990 --> 03:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
help that they need to keep their
 
03:25:53.469 --> 03:25:53.479 align:start position:0%
kids and in the worst of circumstances
 
03:25:56.469 --> 03:25:56.479 align:start position:0%
having to remove kids at times having
 
03:25:58.110 --> 03:25:58.120 align:start position:0%
done that
 
03:26:03.349 --> 03:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
job briefly um also having um worked
 
03:26:05.429 --> 03:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
with adolescence for a great deal of my
 
03:26:07.990 --> 03:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
career and therefore been in court a
 
03:26:11.469 --> 03:26:11.479 align:start position:0%
great deal with kids who were um
 
03:26:13.870 --> 03:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
involved in that
 
03:26:17.950 --> 03:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
system um and even having participated
 
03:26:21.950 --> 03:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
in one case in
 
03:26:25.150 --> 03:26:25.160 align:start position:0%
um you know witness and a termination of
 
03:26:28.790 --> 03:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
parental rights um case which was
 
03:26:28.800 --> 03:26:30.309 align:start position:0%
parental rights um case which was
incredibly

03:26:30.309 --> 03:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
incredibly
 
03:26:34.469 --> 03:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
painful um as someone who's done those
 
03:26:37.830 --> 03:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
things um I would be the first one to
 
03:26:42.349 --> 03:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
say that these systems are imperfect and
 
03:26:44.510 --> 03:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are really bad things
 
03:26:48.229 --> 03:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
that happen um but in my experience and
 
03:26:50.510 --> 03:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
it's not current experience in New
 
03:26:54.070 --> 03:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in my experience um most of
 
03:26:56.870 --> 03:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
the time people do the best that they
 
03:26:58.990 --> 03:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
can and they work pretty
 
03:27:03.150 --> 03:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:06.670 --> 03:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would just like to um kind
 
03:27:08.670 --> 03:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
of piggyback on what representative
 
03:27:13.870 --> 03:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
Palmer said is that that number one we
 
03:27:15.990 --> 03:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
should be very careful about not
 
03:27:18.510 --> 03:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
amplifying that distrust through laws
 
03:27:22.870 --> 03:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
that we bills that we bring and um
 
03:27:26.110 --> 03:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
speeches that we make and bills that we
 
03:27:30.309 --> 03:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
pass um but also as people know we have
 
03:27:33.469 --> 03:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
had a shortage of dcyf workers in this
 
03:27:37.110 --> 03:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
state which have led to some some
 
03:27:40.150 --> 03:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunate situations in our Protective
 
03:27:41.830 --> 03:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
Services um
 
03:27:44.790 --> 03:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
ecosystem in New Hampshire and you know
 
03:27:46.910 --> 03:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
at various times there have been efforts
 
03:27:52.910 --> 03:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
to um hire more people and um it's
 
03:27:54.429 --> 03:27:54.439 align:start position:0%
difficult to hire people to do an
 
03:27:57.830 --> 03:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult job and I
 
03:28:02.830 --> 03:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
think bills like this will be seen as
 
03:28:05.189 --> 03:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
um kind of
 
03:28:07.389 --> 03:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
disrespecting people in those jobs
 
03:28:09.349 --> 03:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
assuming the worst about people in those
 
03:28:12.229 --> 03:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
jobs and make it more difficult
 
03:28:15.469 --> 03:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
um to get people to want to do that kind
 
03:28:20.550 --> 03:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
of work um and so for all those reasons
 
03:28:23.870 --> 03:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
I um once again I will say that I I will
 
03:28:26.710 --> 03:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
vote against this and I think this is a
 
03:28:29.389 --> 03:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
um this will be really unfortunate if we
 
03:28:32.110 --> 03:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
pass this bill representative Seth King
 
03:28:33.630 --> 03:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chair I just want to
 
03:28:35.590 --> 03:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
piggy back on what representative mlan
 
03:28:37.990 --> 03:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
said I really liked what he had to say
 
03:28:39.389 --> 03:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
um it's not just about the trust it's
 
03:28:41.670 --> 03:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
also about um uh being being seen as
 
03:28:44.550 --> 03:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
trustful and um when it comes to
 
03:28:47.429 --> 03:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
different departments um there are very
 
03:28:49.150 --> 03:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
few departments that I think people get
 
03:28:51.830 --> 03:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
as emotional about as this one I mean
 
03:28:53.870 --> 03:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
people might be upset about a certain
 
03:28:55.950 --> 03:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
hunting rule with fish and game or
 
03:28:57.590 --> 03:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
something but when it comes to losing
 
03:28:59.229 --> 03:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
your children there's nothing that's
 
03:29:00.710 --> 03:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
going to make somebody go crazy more
 
03:29:02.910 --> 03:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
than that you know and if they think
 
03:29:05.429 --> 03:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
that there's anything about the system
 
03:29:07.670 --> 03:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
that is corrupt or rigged against them
 
03:29:10.189 --> 03:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
it just makes the matter that much worse
 
03:29:13.030 --> 03:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
and um to say to respond to what
 
03:29:15.870 --> 03:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer said he said well
 
03:29:18.030 --> 03:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
um you know we don't want to we don't
 
03:29:20.550 --> 03:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
want to do anything that could upset
 
03:29:22.670 --> 03:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
people and a lot of what we do to upset
 
03:29:24.950 --> 03:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
people is in the legislature and I agree
 
03:29:26.349 --> 03:29:26.359 align:start position:0%
but I really don't think there's going
 
03:29:28.630 --> 03:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
to be anybody at home that is going to
 
03:29:31.349 --> 03:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
be bummed out about this bill passing I
 
03:29:33.870 --> 03:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
think there are people though that are
 
03:29:36.389 --> 03:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
seriously unhappy with the way DCF is
 
03:29:40.110 --> 03:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
run today and certain things about it um
 
03:29:42.550 --> 03:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
but I don't think anybody body at home I
 
03:29:43.750 --> 03:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
don't think the average person is going
 
03:29:46.349 --> 03:29:46.359 align:start position:0%
to be bummed that dcyf employees cannot
 
03:29:49.070 --> 03:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
simultaneously work for child adoption
 
03:29:51.910 --> 03:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
services nobody's nobody's thinking that
 
03:29:53.469 --> 03:29:53.479 align:start position:0%
um but there are a lot of people that
 
03:29:56.070 --> 03:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
are that would not be happy about the
 
03:29:58.389 --> 03:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
reverse so that's why I favor this Bill
 
03:30:00.870 --> 03:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative TZ did you have
 
03:30:04.229 --> 03:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
your hand up yeah I just wanted to say
 
03:30:07.389 --> 03:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
that you know I am freshman but this
 
03:30:09.309 --> 03:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
makes me wonder about does this mean now
 
03:30:10.710 --> 03:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to be facing all sorts of
 
03:30:12.910 --> 03:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
other bills for
 
03:30:15.950 --> 03:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
specific uh laws to be put in place for
 
03:30:18.910 --> 03:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
specific types of situations where as
 
03:30:20.710 --> 03:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer pointed out this
 
03:30:24.030 --> 03:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
could be handled at a rule level a you
 
03:30:26.150 --> 03:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
know other kind of policy level not
 
03:30:28.990 --> 03:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily requiring legislation and
 
03:30:31.750 --> 03:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
again fundamentally we heard no evidence
 
03:30:34.590 --> 03:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
that this actually is a real um that
 
03:30:36.189 --> 03:30:36.199 align:start position:0%
this there's that there's any kind of
 
03:30:38.269 --> 03:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
problem and I also doubt that there's
 
03:30:41.070 --> 03:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
anyone really you know spending time
 
03:30:43.349 --> 03:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
time thinking about it because we've had
 
03:30:46.110 --> 03:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
no evidence that this actually is a real
 
03:30:48.510 --> 03:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
problem thank
 
03:30:51.910 --> 03:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
you um representative Leon um thank you
 
03:30:54.550 --> 03:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I've noticed tensions rise a
 
03:30:57.070 --> 03:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
lot during this discussion and I just
 
03:30:59.429 --> 03:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
want to remind everybody about article
 
03:31:01.870 --> 03:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
30 of our constitution unfortunately
 
03:31:03.790 --> 03:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
another heated discussion in a previous
 
03:31:06.429 --> 03:31:06.439 align:start position:0%
year in the legislature led to somebody
 
03:31:09.030 --> 03:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
having legal action taken out taken
 
03:31:12.309 --> 03:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
against them for defamation um um it
 
03:31:13.830 --> 03:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
it's currently going through the court
 
03:31:15.990 --> 03:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
process so I can't speak to it too much
 
03:31:18.070 --> 03:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
so I do want to remind us of the
 
03:31:20.590 --> 03:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution which states the freedom of
 
03:31:23.389 --> 03:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
deliberation speech and debate in either
 
03:31:25.910 --> 03:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
House of the legislature is so essential
 
03:31:27.710 --> 03:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
to the rights of the people that it
 
03:31:29.950 --> 03:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
cannot be the foundation of any action
 
03:31:32.670 --> 03:31:32.680 align:start position:0%
complaint or prosecution in any other
 
03:31:35.429 --> 03:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
Court or Place whatsoever so I just want
 
03:31:38.070 --> 03:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
to remind everybody of that and uh also
 
03:31:39.309 --> 03:31:39.319 align:start position:0%
realize we're all just trying to look
 
03:31:40.670 --> 03:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
out for the best interest of kids and
 
03:31:43.189 --> 03:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
family Ames we just may disagree on how
 
03:31:45.269 --> 03:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
to do this but let's not let our
 
03:31:47.389 --> 03:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
emotions on that override how we're
 
03:31:50.750 --> 03:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
acting today so thank you other
 
03:31:53.870 --> 03:31:53.880 align:start position:0%

03:31:55.950 --> 03:31:55.960 align:start position:0%

this
 
03:35:47.229 --> 03:35:47.239 align:start position:0%
afternoon um so I am going to adjourn
 
03:35:50.429 --> 03:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
the executive session uh the hour is
 
03:35:54.229 --> 03:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
currently 105 um my recommendation of
 
03:35:55.950 --> 03:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
the committee unless his objection would
 
03:35:58.309 --> 03:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
be people take lunch at their Leisure uh
 
03:36:00.550 --> 03:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
during the course of the afternoon uh
 
03:36:03.469 --> 03:36:03.479 align:start position:0%
rather than delay uh proceedings you
 
03:36:06.630 --> 03:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
know considerably any any opposition to
 
03:36:06.640 --> 03:36:07.389 align:start position:0%
know considerably any any opposition to
that

03:36:07.389 --> 03:36:07.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:36:11.309 --> 03:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
idea oh okay all we have can we do five
 
03:36:12.990 --> 03:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
minutes just to get the bathroom sure
 
03:36:15.150 --> 03:36:15.160 align:start position:0%
yeah we we'll we'll take a a quick U
 
03:36:17.870 --> 03:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
quick break uh five maybe 10 minutes
 
03:36:19.389 --> 03:36:19.399 align:start position:0%
we'll take we'll take what's
 
03:36:21.229 --> 03:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
that seven
 
03:36:39.469 --> 03:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:39.479 --> 03:37:09.389 align:start position:0%
 
sure

03:37:09.389 --> 03:37:09.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:09.399 --> 03:41:09.030 align:start position:0%
 
want

03:41:09.030 --> 03:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:09.040 --> 03:41:39.030 align:start position:0%
 
there

03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:39.040 --> 03:50:17.590 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:50:17.590 --> 03:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:20.950 --> 03:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
1633 which has a 4 o position uh
 
03:50:23.349 --> 03:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
possession limit uh the purpose of this
 
03:50:24.830 --> 03:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
bill would be change to change the
 
03:50:29.149 --> 03:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
medical purchase limit uh from 2 oz to 4
 
03:50:32.070 --> 03:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
oz uh that's because it doesn't really
 
03:50:34.429 --> 03:50:34.439 align:start position:0%
make a whole lot of sense for patients
 
03:50:36.750 --> 03:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to go into a medical uh
 
03:50:39.950 --> 03:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
dispensary and purchase 2 O
 
03:50:41.630 --> 03:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
of cannabis when they could go to a
 
03:50:43.870 --> 03:50:43.880 align:start position:0%
recreational facility and purchase
 
03:50:48.510 --> 03:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
four um so there are also another of a
 
03:50:50.990 --> 03:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
number of other reasons why uh we should
 
03:50:53.189 --> 03:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
allow patients to purchase 4 ounces uh
 
03:50:55.510 --> 03:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
because patients may be uh in need of
 
03:50:58.950 --> 03:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
different dosages uh so they could use
 
03:51:03.269 --> 03:51:03.279 align:start position:0%
more uh than uh and require them to go
 
03:51:05.830 --> 03:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
to The Dispensary more frequently we
 
03:51:07.429 --> 03:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
only have seven dispensaries across the
 
03:51:09.630 --> 03:51:09.640 align:start position:0%
entire State and people with mob
 
03:51:11.469 --> 03:51:11.479 align:start position:0%
problems or people who with limited
 
03:51:14.189 --> 03:51:14.199 align:start position:0%
Transportation have sometimes difficulty
 
03:51:16.630 --> 03:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
getting to their uh dispensary that they
 
03:51:19.590 --> 03:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
use uh to be able to purchase uh their
 
03:51:23.229 --> 03:51:23.239 align:start position:0%
medicinal cannabis so if you'd help me
 
03:51:25.910 --> 03:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh support this bill and kind of fix a
 
03:51:27.149 --> 03:51:27.159 align:start position:0%
potential upcoming problem that we're
 
03:51:28.510 --> 03:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
going to see in our legislation that'd
 
03:51:30.030 --> 03:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
be great thank
 
03:51:32.469 --> 03:51:32.479 align:start position:0%
you thank you any
 
03:51:34.990 --> 03:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative Leon um thank
 
03:51:36.110 --> 03:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:51:37.670 --> 03:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward I think that it's
 
03:51:39.389 --> 03:51:39.399 align:start position:0%
great to look perspectively about what's
 
03:51:41.630 --> 03:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
happening in the larger environment um
 
03:51:44.510 --> 03:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
my question is actually in section two
 
03:51:46.910 --> 03:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
um that's in sub paragraph uh seven
 
03:51:48.990 --> 03:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
there it talks it increases the amount
 
03:51:51.229 --> 03:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
of obtaining more than 2 ounces changing
 
03:51:53.189 --> 03:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
it to four of cannabis in any 10day
 
03:51:56.030 --> 03:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
period in violation of the rsas um my
 
03:51:59.790 --> 03:51:59.800 align:start position:0%
question would be if um I guess I also
 
03:52:00.830 --> 03:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to Doom this in the other
 
03:52:03.389 --> 03:52:03.399 align:start position:0%
body but um if it might make sense that
 
03:52:04.830 --> 03:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
if there is somebody who has a higher
 
03:52:06.870 --> 03:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
need that those that are writing that
 
03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
certification may want to um allow more
 
03:52:11.229 --> 03:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
within that time period perhaps it's
 
03:52:12.550 --> 03:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
better to defer that question to
 
03:52:13.910 --> 03:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
somebody else but I just wanted to make
 
03:52:16.030 --> 03:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not limiting people yeah
 
03:52:17.510 --> 03:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
I mean that that that would make a lot
 
03:52:19.309 --> 03:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
of sense uh and I I would definitely be
 
03:52:22.469 --> 03:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
open to uh some changes there thank
 
03:52:25.429 --> 03:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
you other
 
03:52:34.189 --> 03:52:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:36.630 --> 03:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy
 
03:52:38.040 --> 03:52:44.550 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy
Thomas

03:52:44.550 --> 03:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:47.510 --> 03:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
hi everyone um representative Wendy
 
03:52:50.910 --> 03:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
Thomas town of marac um I come before
 
03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
you in support of this bill there are
 
03:52:57.189 --> 03:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
several reasons to support it um besides
 
03:52:59.429 --> 03:52:59.439 align:start position:0%
the fact that it would match the legal
 
03:53:01.309 --> 03:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh recreational bills that are being
 
03:53:03.990 --> 03:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
proposed one is that cannabis Works
 
03:53:07.670 --> 03:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
differently for each person uh and so we
 
03:53:09.870 --> 03:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
use different strains use different
 
03:53:12.469 --> 03:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
amounts uh I recently went up to Maine
 
03:53:14.790 --> 03:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
to talk to a cannabis grower who grows
 
03:53:18.110 --> 03:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
for recreation as well as uh creates um
 
03:53:20.229 --> 03:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
therapeutic products and she was telling
 
03:53:22.670 --> 03:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
me of a cancer patient that uses 12200
 
03:53:25.469 --> 03:53:25.479 align:start position:0%
milligrams a day of cannabis and they're
 
03:53:27.750 --> 03:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
functioning that's that's a ton if I
 
03:53:31.030 --> 03:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
took 1,200 I would be out like a light
 
03:53:36.110 --> 03:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
um they but that that's for cancer um
 
03:53:38.429 --> 03:53:38.439 align:start position:0%
and it was actually for brain cancer um
 
03:53:39.990 --> 03:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
I've also talk to people that have
 
03:53:42.830 --> 03:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
worked in dispensaries that their
 
03:53:45.189 --> 03:53:45.199 align:start position:0%
average dose their daily dose is 100
 
03:53:48.349 --> 03:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
milligrams at a time and again if I took
 
03:53:51.149 --> 03:53:51.159 align:start position:0%
something like that I would be out as a
 
03:53:55.030 --> 03:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
patient my comfort dose is between five
 
03:53:57.030 --> 03:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
and 10 milligrams at a time that's what
 
03:54:00.710 --> 03:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
I take I don't I don't need a lot but
 
03:54:02.309 --> 03:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
thank thankfully I don't need a lot
 
03:54:03.510 --> 03:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people that just
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
metabolize it differently and they need
 
03:54:05.279 --> 03:54:06.710 align:start position:0%
metabolize it differently and they need
a

03:54:06.710 --> 03:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:54:09.710 --> 03:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
lot um I will tell you that uh one of
 
03:54:13.670 --> 03:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
the uh products that I use now is a very
 
03:54:16.590 --> 03:54:16.600 align:start position:0%
concentrated um product with cannabis
 
03:54:20.110 --> 03:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
and it is actually 50% THC in this
 
03:54:23.229 --> 03:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
product but when I use it it's an oil
 
03:54:25.550 --> 03:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
and I only use a tiny tiny amount and
 
03:54:28.349 --> 03:54:28.359 align:start position:0%
it's compared to a grain of rice it's
 
03:54:31.269 --> 03:54:31.279 align:start position:0%
about 10 milligrams for that dosage for
 
03:54:34.189 --> 03:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
me to take that that product I'm taking
 
03:54:37.309 --> 03:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
it for cancer I'm taking it for pain but
 
03:54:39.110 --> 03:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
to make if I wanted to make that that
 
03:54:40.910 --> 03:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
product on my own and there are ways to
 
03:54:44.710 --> 03:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
make it I would need a lot of cannabis
 
03:54:48.389 --> 03:54:48.399 align:start position:0%
um keeping patients to 2 ounces for me
 
03:54:50.510 --> 03:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's fine 2 ounces I don't think I've
 
03:54:53.469 --> 03:54:53.479 align:start position:0%
ever in my lifetime hit the the maximum
 
03:54:56.389 --> 03:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
level of 2 ounces however I know many
 
03:54:58.710 --> 03:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
many cancer patients many many patients
 
03:55:01.429 --> 03:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
with terminal illnesses that need a lot
 
03:55:04.710 --> 03:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
more they burn through the 2 O burn I
 
03:55:06.990 --> 03:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to say that they use the 2
 
03:55:10.469 --> 03:55:10.479 align:start position:0%
oz um that they're allowed to get and
 
03:55:13.149 --> 03:55:13.159 align:start position:0%
then they augment it by buying stuff on
 
03:55:15.070 --> 03:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
the street because they just don't have
 
03:55:17.950 --> 03:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
enough and lastly transportation is a
 
03:55:20.750 --> 03:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
big problem um as the previous speaker
 
03:55:23.510 --> 03:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
um mentioned we have 10 uh dispens we
 
03:55:25.349 --> 03:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
have seven dispensaries in the state of
 
03:55:27.229 --> 03:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that means that some
 
03:55:29.349 --> 03:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
people have to travel a long way to get
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
to these dispensaries if we increased
 
03:55:34.389 --> 03:55:34.399 align:start position:0%
the amount to match what we're talking
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
about recreationally these people may
 
03:55:40.990 --> 03:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
not have to do that travel every 10 days
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
I'm open for any questions if you'd like
 
03:55:45.070 --> 03:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
03:55:45.080 --> 03:55:47.070 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
representative

03:55:47.070 --> 03:55:47.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:55:55.950 --> 03:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:58.469 --> 03:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to skip out for lunch and
 
03:56:00.870 --> 03:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
turn the chair over to Vice chairman
 
03:56:05.670 --> 03:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
Leon for a while so representative Lon
 
03:56:08.269 --> 03:56:08.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh and next we'd like to
 
03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
call Matt Simon from Green Leaf cannabis
 
03:56:11.520 --> 03:56:19.070 align:start position:0%
call Matt Simon from Green Leaf cannabis
thank

03:56:19.070 --> 03:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:21.950 --> 03:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair again for the
 
03:56:23.990 --> 03:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
record it's Matt Simon I work for
 
03:56:27.349 --> 03:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
granite Leaf cannabis Sor um no problem
 
03:56:29.590 --> 03:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
at all uh if that name is unfamiliar to
 
03:56:31.030 --> 03:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
folks last time I was in this committee
 
03:56:32.710 --> 03:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
we had a different company name we
 
03:56:34.349 --> 03:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
changed our name in September so we're
 
03:56:37.389 --> 03:56:37.399 align:start position:0%
still the same New Hampshire focused
 
03:56:39.590 --> 03:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
nonprofit with the two dispensaries but
 
03:56:42.710 --> 03:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
we are Granite Leaf cannabis and uh the
 
03:56:44.510 --> 03:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
previous speakers have made most of the
 
03:56:46.990 --> 03:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
points I intended to make I think the
 
03:56:49.710 --> 03:56:49.720 align:start position:0%
main reason this bill came up is because
 
03:56:52.950 --> 03:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
the house uh both last year and the year
 
03:56:54.910 --> 03:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
before passed two totally different
 
03:56:56.710 --> 03:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
adult use legalization bills but they
 
03:56:58.630 --> 03:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
had one thing in common they both had a
 
03:57:00.990 --> 03:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
4 ounce possession limit and if either
 
03:57:03.189 --> 03:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
of them had passed into law we would
 
03:57:05.149 --> 03:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
have had a 4 ooun possession limit for
 
03:57:07.429 --> 03:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
adults 21 and older but a 2 ooun
 
03:57:09.269 --> 03:57:09.279 align:start position:0%
possession limit for register patients
 
03:57:11.710 --> 03:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
and that didn't make sense so this bill
 
03:57:15.030 --> 03:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
would put the therapeutic program on the
 
03:57:17.630 --> 03:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
same footing with with adults uh who
 
03:57:20.469 --> 03:57:20.479 align:start position:0%
would be become legal consumers if the
 
03:57:23.309 --> 03:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
other Bill were pass uh as others have
 
03:57:25.590 --> 03:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned we do have only seven
 
03:57:27.349 --> 03:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
dispensaries in the state so a lot of
 
03:57:29.229 --> 03:57:29.239 align:start position:0%
patients do have a drive of more than an
 
03:57:31.550 --> 03:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
hour and if they're purchasing cannabis
 
03:57:34.349 --> 03:57:34.359 align:start position:0%
every 10 days I'm not a math Wiz but
 
03:57:37.309 --> 03:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
that's like 36 and a half trips to the
 
03:57:39.550 --> 03:57:39.560 align:start position:0%
dispensary in a year and for a lot of
 
03:57:42.269 --> 03:57:42.279 align:start position:0%
people that's far from ideal so this
 
03:57:43.550 --> 03:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
would make it so that people could make
 
03:57:45.750 --> 03:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
fewer trips and stock up a little more
 
03:57:48.830 --> 03:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
when they do it so please support this
 
03:57:51.670 --> 03:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
bill be happy to take any questions are
 
03:57:52.750 --> 03:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
there any
 
03:57:55.750 --> 03:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
questions um I actually have one for you
 
03:57:57.510 --> 03:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
um would you advise people that are
 
03:57:59.469 --> 03:57:59.479 align:start position:0%
involved in those adult use bills to
 
03:58:02.269 --> 03:58:02.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps change the language so that the
 
03:58:05.229 --> 03:58:05.239 align:start position:0%
um so that the therapeutic cannabis is
 
03:58:07.469 --> 03:58:07.479 align:start position:0%
in addition to whatever the limit for
 
03:58:09.469 --> 03:58:09.479 align:start position:0%
other adult use would
 
03:58:11.229 --> 03:58:11.239 align:start position:0%
so that you're not so that you're not
 
03:58:14.349 --> 03:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
saying that I I guess my question is do
 
03:58:15.710 --> 03:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
you want to mean do you want to
 
03:58:17.110 --> 03:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
basically block somebody off from that
 
03:58:18.670 --> 03:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
other access or would it make more sense
 
03:58:20.269 --> 03:58:20.279 align:start position:0%
for the therapeutic cannabis to be on
 
03:58:22.510 --> 03:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
top of the adult use
 
03:58:24.950 --> 03:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
limits thank you for the question I
 
03:58:26.830 --> 03:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
don't think I have an answer on that I
 
03:58:28.950 --> 03:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
think that would be a policy choice for
 
03:58:30.910 --> 03:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
the general court my biggest concern is
 
03:58:33.870 --> 03:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
that we not create a standard uh for
 
03:58:36.269 --> 03:58:36.279 align:start position:0%
adult use that is twice as high as the
 
03:58:39.269 --> 03:58:39.279 align:start position:0%
standard for patients so
 
03:58:42.070 --> 03:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh that makes sense I recognize that and
 
03:58:43.429 --> 03:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for noticing the oversight in
 
03:58:46.189 --> 03:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
our legislation thank
 
03:58:48.110 --> 03:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
you with that I don't see any more
 
03:58:49.429 --> 03:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
03:58:53.309 --> 03:58:53.319 align:start position:0%
thank you supposed to back to you um and
 
03:58:55.469 --> 03:58:55.479 align:start position:0%
with that I will call Jim
 
03:58:58.030 --> 03:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
Riddle thank you and so we're trying to
 
03:58:59.790 --> 03:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
keep testimony to three minutes the
 
03:59:01.510 --> 03:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
spudger will go off and uh if you keep
 
03:59:03.349 --> 03:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
going beyond that we'll remind you so
 
03:59:04.990 --> 03:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
just to let everyone know this afternoon
 
03:59:06.870 --> 03:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you madam chair members of the
 
03:59:08.990 --> 03:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Jim Riddle
 
03:59:11.870 --> 03:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro I have a uh New Hampshire
 
03:59:15.550 --> 03:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis card I also uh hold a
 
03:59:19.030 --> 03:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
USDA hemp grower license um and I'm on
 
03:59:21.189 --> 03:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
The Advisory Board of the New Hampshire
 
03:59:23.229 --> 03:59:23.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis Association I'm here to speak
 
03:59:27.070 --> 03:59:27.080 align:start position:0%
on my own behalf and I'm here to support
 
03:59:28.750 --> 03:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
uh HB
 
03:59:31.550 --> 03:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
1350 and to increase that possession
 
03:59:34.269 --> 03:59:34.279 align:start position:0%
limit from 2 to 4 oun to be consistent
 
03:59:36.750 --> 03:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
with the adult use Market that's being
 
03:59:39.269 --> 03:59:39.279 align:start position:0%
proposed but I do want want to just
 
03:59:41.670 --> 03:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
challenge the whole notion of a
 
03:59:45.229 --> 03:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
possession limit I mean I can go to the
 
03:59:48.309 --> 03:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
state liquor store and fill my car with
 
03:59:50.990 --> 03:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
wine or whiskey I can throw in some
 
03:59:53.590 --> 03:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
bottles of Everclear even pure grain
 
03:59:56.349 --> 03:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
alcohol there's absolutely no possession
 
03:59:59.149 --> 03:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
limits on uh alcohol and We Know It
 
04:00:02.590 --> 04:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
Kills you you know it's bad uh for you
 
04:00:05.790 --> 04:00:05.800 align:start position:0%
but yet a person can buy transport
 
04:00:08.830 --> 04:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
consume have in storage as much alcohol
 
04:00:11.910 --> 04:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
as they possibly uh could want so it's
 
04:00:14.710 --> 04:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
like I think it's a transition but it
 
04:00:16.750 --> 04:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
does seem to me like a bit of a nanny
 
04:00:19.389 --> 04:00:19.399 align:start position:0%
state of looking over my shoulder to
 
04:00:22.149 --> 04:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
control to make sure that I don't have
 
04:00:25.269 --> 04:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
too much in my possession and um you
 
04:00:27.149 --> 04:00:27.159 align:start position:0%
know there just haven't been problems
 
04:00:30.229 --> 04:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
with medical card holders buying up and
 
04:00:32.349 --> 04:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
then reselling I mean it's just has not
 
04:00:34.030 --> 04:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
been a problem in all the years that the
 
04:00:37.149 --> 04:00:37.159 align:start position:0%
program has existed so I support the
 
04:00:39.670 --> 04:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
bill but I do just have a problem in
 
04:00:42.389 --> 04:00:42.399 align:start position:0%
general we don't limit other medications
 
04:00:44.269 --> 04:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
it's placing limits on people's Health
 
04:00:46.670 --> 04:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
Care choices and that their preferred
 
04:00:49.830 --> 04:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
treatments but thank you thank you are
 
04:00:51.630 --> 04:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the
 
04:00:53.630 --> 04:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
04:00:55.990 --> 04:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
much for the testimony sorry I'm doing a
 
04:00:58.830 --> 04:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
bad bad job handing these off uh next I
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
will call the honorable Jerry kerk to
 
04:01:07.030 --> 04:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:09.229 --> 04:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
microphone thank you very much Madam
 
04:01:11.830 --> 04:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
chair and my testimony I distributed
 
04:01:13.870 --> 04:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
everybody has it along with the bill
 
04:01:17.149 --> 04:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
couple Beyond this too um once again for
 
04:01:18.990 --> 04:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
the record Jerry kerk chair of the
 
04:01:20.630 --> 04:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
04:01:24.269 --> 04:01:24.279 align:start position:0%
board and um the board voted unanimously
 
04:01:26.110 --> 04:01:26.120 align:start position:0%
to support HB
 
04:01:29.790 --> 04:01:29.800 align:start position:0%
1350 the discussion uh some of this will
 
04:01:31.070 --> 04:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
be slightly redone but I want to tell
 
04:01:33.790 --> 04:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
you what we said at our meeting that
 
04:01:36.070 --> 04:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
specifically it will help our patients
 
04:01:38.229 --> 04:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
because Edibles that are sold at atcs
 
04:01:40.910 --> 04:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
are expensive so in order to save money
 
04:01:42.429 --> 04:01:42.439 align:start position:0%
many of our patients make their own
 
04:01:44.389 --> 04:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
batches of Edibles they'll get the plant
 
04:01:46.429 --> 04:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
they'll make an edible uh that they can
 
04:01:48.870 --> 04:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
then use over many months but most the
 
04:01:51.229 --> 04:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
recipes take a kind of large amount of
 
04:01:53.269 --> 04:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
cannabis to make the batches so the 2 O
 
04:01:55.429 --> 04:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
limit makes that difficult and that's
 
04:01:57.149 --> 04:01:57.159 align:start position:0%
particularly true for oncology patients
 
04:01:59.630 --> 04:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
who may be using higher Doses and you
 
04:02:00.950 --> 04:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
could say well you know they just go
 
04:02:02.670 --> 04:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
back to ATC and buy another couple
 
04:02:04.269 --> 04:02:04.279 align:start position:0%
ounces 10 days later well that puts them
 
04:02:05.710 --> 04:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
in violation of their possession limit
 
04:02:07.469 --> 04:02:07.479 align:start position:0%
that's why the how often you can buy
 
04:02:09.469 --> 04:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
would need to be changed in how much you
 
04:02:11.349 --> 04:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
can buy every 10 days I mean do we have
 
04:02:12.990 --> 04:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
to be changed in order to still make
 
04:02:15.790 --> 04:02:15.800 align:start position:0%
this work one of the main things though
 
04:02:18.670 --> 04:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
again is that distance if you live in a
 
04:02:20.990 --> 04:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
rural area trip to an ATC can be a very
 
04:02:23.950 --> 04:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
long issue and this is particularly
 
04:02:26.149 --> 04:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
difficult for older patients who don't
 
04:02:28.110 --> 04:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
like driving long distances particularly
 
04:02:29.710 --> 04:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
maybe at night or whatever patients in
 
04:02:32.950 --> 04:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
pain oncology patients and I always like
 
04:02:35.309 --> 04:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
to think through analogies I live about
 
04:02:36.950 --> 04:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
an hour and a half round trip from my
 
04:02:39.830 --> 04:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy when I go refill my uh
 
04:02:42.870 --> 04:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
prescription for L Center Pearl for my
 
04:02:46.469 --> 04:02:46.479 align:start position:0%
hypertension I get a 3month supply I
 
04:02:48.189 --> 04:02:48.199 align:start position:0%
don't have to go back every 10 days so I
 
04:02:49.670 --> 04:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
think the 10day part is already a little
 
04:02:51.590 --> 04:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
bit of a nuisance but allowing people to
 
04:02:53.910 --> 04:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
buy 4 ounces every 10 days might mean
 
04:02:55.990 --> 04:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
they only have to go once a month or
 
04:02:58.469 --> 04:02:58.479 align:start position:0%
something rather than having to go uh
 
04:02:59.950 --> 04:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
more frequently so it's really going to
 
04:03:02.269 --> 04:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
make a big difference and we also
 
04:03:03.389 --> 04:03:03.399 align:start position:0%
recognize the issue that the
 
04:03:05.429 --> 04:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
recreational Cannabis bills have talked
 
04:03:07.149 --> 04:03:07.159 align:start position:0%
about 4 ounces but we've also talked
 
04:03:09.550 --> 04:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
about recreational can abis for a decade
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
or more and it hasn't passed yet so even
 
04:03:13.830 --> 04:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
if that doesn't pass this still is a
 
04:03:16.429 --> 04:03:16.439 align:start position:0%
good thing to do so we urge you to pass
 
04:03:18.590 --> 04:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
this bill it'll save money for patients
 
04:03:20.070 --> 04:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
it'll also save a lot of time
 
04:03:21.469 --> 04:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
particularly those who live a long ways
 
04:03:23.550 --> 04:03:23.560 align:start position:0%
from an ATC and I'll be glad to take
 
04:03:25.510 --> 04:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there any
 
04:03:27.229 --> 04:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:03:27.239 --> 04:03:29.149 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

04:03:29.149 --> 04:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:03:31.149 --> 04:03:31.159 align:start position:0%
Palmer this may be a little bit of a
 
04:03:33.830 --> 04:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
silly question but um we're talking
 
04:03:35.910 --> 04:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
about 2 and 4 ounce limits but then most
 
04:03:38.429 --> 04:03:38.439 align:start position:0%
doses are in grams and how how many
 
04:03:42.269 --> 04:03:42.279 align:start position:0%
people translate all of that well and um
 
04:03:44.429 --> 04:03:44.439 align:start position:0%
how does that work I mean you go to the
 
04:03:47.590 --> 04:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
you go to the dispensary and you
 
04:03:50.429 --> 04:03:50.439 align:start position:0%
get 2 ounces or 4 ounces and then you
 
04:03:53.910 --> 04:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
make gram doses um I mean maybe people
 
04:03:55.950 --> 04:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
who do this all the time it's yeah I
 
04:03:59.149 --> 04:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
think I though I I I don't I don't have
 
04:04:01.189 --> 04:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
a card I don't use this stuff so I can't
 
04:04:02.990 --> 04:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
answer exactly all those details but I'm
 
04:04:04.870 --> 04:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that most people would have
 
04:04:08.269 --> 04:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
a recipe would say you know use 2 oz or
 
04:04:10.990 --> 04:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
whatever of something which contains
 
04:04:14.630 --> 04:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps 30% THC or 10% THC or something
 
04:04:16.070 --> 04:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
like that so you'd have an idea what
 
04:04:17.429 --> 04:04:17.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to do because you're right
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
if you make a batch with 1 ounce of
 
04:04:21.750 --> 04:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis and it's a 10% THC it's going
 
04:04:24.910 --> 04:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
to be a lot different than if it's a 50%
 
04:04:26.790 --> 04:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
THC because the strains do have
 
04:04:29.349 --> 04:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
different THC CBD or cannaboid
 
04:04:29.359 --> 04:04:31.950 align:start position:0%
different THC CBD or cannaboid
concentrations

04:04:31.950 --> 04:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
concentrations
 
04:04:36.149 --> 04:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
yeah um thank you are there um we'll we
 
04:04:38.030 --> 04:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
can call you back after we have the
 
04:04:40.630 --> 04:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
other people testify representative
 
04:04:43.510 --> 04:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
Thomas okay yeah she would know more
 
04:04:45.990 --> 04:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
than I probably about that um and then I
 
04:04:48.030 --> 04:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
guess my other question is that a lot of
 
04:04:50.590 --> 04:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
the stuff is dispensed in milligrams and
 
04:04:51.990 --> 04:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
there's no real consistency in
 
04:04:55.149 --> 04:04:55.159 align:start position:0%
Translation between that and gr and um
 
04:04:58.229 --> 04:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
and ounces of plant form cannabis if you
 
04:05:01.229 --> 04:05:01.239 align:start position:0%
were to have a low potency 10% THC
 
04:05:04.870 --> 04:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
content cannabis versus one of the uh I
 
04:05:06.790 --> 04:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
think they're trying to push 30% out in
 
04:05:08.429 --> 04:05:08.439 align:start position:0%
California and some places but I'm not
 
04:05:10.030 --> 04:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
sure if they've actually broken that
 
04:05:12.630 --> 04:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
that level um you know how how does that
 
04:05:14.670 --> 04:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
translate or are we just simply stuck in
 
04:05:17.670 --> 04:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
some of the echos of the drug war I
 
04:05:19.269 --> 04:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
think we're actually stuck in The Echoes
 
04:05:21.790 --> 04:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
because you're right it would it would
 
04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
it would be kind of weird to say hey you
 
04:05:25.910 --> 04:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
can have 4 ounces of a highly
 
04:05:28.189 --> 04:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
concentrated you only have two you know
 
04:05:30.269 --> 04:05:30.279 align:start position:0%
it it it doesn't make a lot of sense but
 
04:05:32.469 --> 04:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
this is just modifying what's currently
 
04:05:34.269 --> 04:05:34.279 align:start position:0%
in statute I think it might be a little
 
04:05:38.469 --> 04:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
more complicated to have a nomogram that
 
04:05:39.870 --> 04:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
would say how many ounces you can have
 
04:05:41.389 --> 04:05:41.399 align:start position:0%
of what percentage although that would
 
04:05:43.229 --> 04:05:43.239 align:start position:0%
certainly be another way to do it but to
 
04:05:44.710 --> 04:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
remember that there's such variability
 
04:05:46.910 --> 04:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
in What patients need is the main issue
 
04:05:50.309 --> 04:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
is that a oncology patient um as was
 
04:05:52.149 --> 04:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier may require a very
 
04:05:54.469 --> 04:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
large dose and a person using it for
 
04:05:56.830 --> 04:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
social anxiety or well it's not approved
 
04:06:00.030 --> 04:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
yet sorry are using it for yeah well for
 
04:06:01.990 --> 04:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
something else may use a tiny dose I
 
04:06:04.229 --> 04:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
mean I have a even though I could never
 
04:06:05.590 --> 04:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
prescribe this stuff because it didn't
 
04:06:07.830 --> 04:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
come into being excuse me I couldn't
 
04:06:09.189 --> 04:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
certify for this stuff because it didn't
 
04:06:10.429 --> 04:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
come into being until after I left
 
04:06:12.710 --> 04:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
practice I kept track of kept up with a
 
04:06:13.990 --> 04:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
couple of patients who live in the same
 
04:06:15.510 --> 04:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
town and the one gu you know he just
 
04:06:16.830 --> 04:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
uses a little bit of a brownie each
 
04:06:18.389 --> 04:06:18.399 align:start position:0%
night before he goes to bed and that's
 
04:06:20.030 --> 04:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
all he needs and he doesn't need any any
 
04:06:22.550 --> 04:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
opioids it's as simple as that um so
 
04:06:24.710 --> 04:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
some people use really very small
 
04:06:27.750 --> 04:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
amounts yeah it's hugely variable thank
 
04:06:29.229 --> 04:06:29.239 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
04:06:31.269 --> 04:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
04:06:34.269 --> 04:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
much sure thing thank
 
04:06:37.910 --> 04:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
you and uh next I'll call Dr Joe Hannan
 
04:06:39.510 --> 04:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
um this is the last card I have so if
 
04:06:41.429 --> 04:06:41.439 align:start position:0%
anybody else had anything to testify so
 
04:06:42.590 --> 04:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas will'll have you
 
04:06:47.910 --> 04:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:50.110 --> 04:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon Madam chairwoman my
 
04:06:51.110 --> 04:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
name is Joe
 
04:06:53.229 --> 04:06:53.239 align:start position:0%
Hannan I was limping up here my foot
 
04:06:56.070 --> 04:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
fell asleep so it kind of It kind of
 
04:06:57.389 --> 04:06:57.399 align:start position:0%
goes into what I was going to start with
 
04:07:00.229 --> 04:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
was mobility issues um not saying that
 
04:07:01.750 --> 04:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
this is an indication I'm not pushing
 
04:07:04.830 --> 04:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
for sleeping legs to be qualified under
 
04:07:08.510 --> 04:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
this but anyway um you know up until
 
04:07:11.030 --> 04:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
this past summer I'm in my 50s now and I
 
04:07:12.309 --> 04:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
didn't really give much consideration
 
04:07:14.550 --> 04:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
even though I was a practicing doctor
 
04:07:16.469 --> 04:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
for many years and I was in the
 
04:07:17.910 --> 04:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
legislature I had a lot of experience
 
04:07:19.710 --> 04:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
with people with health conditions and
 
04:07:22.030 --> 04:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
mobility issues it didn't really uh hit
 
04:07:23.750 --> 04:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
home to me until the summer when I had
 
04:07:25.229 --> 04:07:25.239 align:start position:0%
serious back problems and I really
 
04:07:27.109 --> 04:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't walk for for over well over a
 
04:07:29.630 --> 04:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
month almost six weeks um and I had to
 
04:07:31.510 --> 04:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
get medicine I was and since I'm in
 
04:07:33.070 --> 04:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
recovery I'm hesitant to take most
 
04:07:34.990 --> 04:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
things and my wife is like hey you need
 
04:07:37.229 --> 04:07:37.239 align:start position:0%
a muscle relaxer just to help you sleep
 
04:07:40.189 --> 04:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
or at least get some of the edge off and
 
04:07:42.750 --> 04:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
I was out of town in some State and I
 
04:07:45.229 --> 04:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
she I got a script called in for 5 days
 
04:07:48.070 --> 04:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
of muscle relaxer just a little bit and
 
04:07:50.070 --> 04:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
I had to walk from a hotel about Three
 
04:07:53.389 --> 04:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
City Blocks to get there and I could
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
barely brush my teeth so just the fact
 
04:07:58.830 --> 04:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
that I had to do that I I it it boggles
 
04:08:00.429 --> 04:08:00.439 align:start position:0%
my mind to think that we're forcing
 
04:08:03.149 --> 04:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
people that have a medical treatment
 
04:08:05.109 --> 04:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
that they have to go very frequently to
 
04:08:08.469 --> 04:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
get filled um you know uh most
 
04:08:10.269 --> 04:08:10.279 align:start position:0%
medications if doctors prescribe them
 
04:08:11.950 --> 04:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
they usually give if it's something that
 
04:08:12.990 --> 04:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
people aren't consistently they're
 
04:08:15.070 --> 04:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
usually 30-day supplies or sometimes 60
 
04:08:17.750 --> 04:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
or 90 days or more uh and they can give
 
04:08:20.030 --> 04:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
refills but you can't do that uh we
 
04:08:21.830 --> 04:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
can't prescribe Doses and stuff and I
 
04:08:23.030 --> 04:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
understand that's why they came out with
 
04:08:24.790 --> 04:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
these limits initially but they really
 
04:08:26.389 --> 04:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
don't make any sense whatsoever when
 
04:08:27.830 --> 04:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
they're we're surrounded by the
 
04:08:29.990 --> 04:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
recreational adult use Market if someone
 
04:08:32.229 --> 04:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
wants more they're going to get it if
 
04:08:33.990 --> 04:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
someone's going to the medical place to
 
04:08:37.309 --> 04:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
get their their medication there's no
 
04:08:39.030 --> 04:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
reason not to allow them to get whatever
 
04:08:40.870 --> 04:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
they want we've heard Alcohol and Other
 
04:08:43.630 --> 04:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
Things um you know 2 ounces he said what
 
04:08:45.349 --> 04:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
is does anyone know what that is it's 56
 
04:08:47.109 --> 04:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
Point some grams so yeah some people
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
know um and that's that's not I learned
 
04:08:54.389 --> 04:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
that from medicine not from my past but
 
04:08:57.109 --> 04:08:57.119 align:start position:0%
um anyway the other thing is it's we
 
04:08:58.590 --> 04:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
know about mobility issues weather there
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
can be power outages travel distances I
 
04:09:01.950 --> 04:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
travel 30 minutes to get my teeth
 
04:09:04.070 --> 04:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
cleaned and you know I'm not in the
 
04:09:05.269 --> 04:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
middle of nowhere I live in the sea
 
04:09:06.510 --> 04:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
Coast it shouldn't be that but that's
 
04:09:08.389 --> 04:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
what people travel New Hampshire for to
 
04:09:10.630 --> 04:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
get basic things I mean I it's the first
 
04:09:12.070 --> 04:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
I've lived many places I've been here
 
04:09:14.070 --> 04:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
over well over a decade I've never been
 
04:09:15.950 --> 04:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
able to not get Chinese food delivered
 
04:09:17.790 --> 04:09:17.800 align:start position:0%
to my house while I live somewhere I
 
04:09:19.189 --> 04:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
can't get Chinese food delivered I have
 
04:09:22.429 --> 04:09:22.439 align:start position:0%
to drive 20 minutes um imagine someone
 
04:09:24.189 --> 04:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
with disability or Mobility condition
 
04:09:26.790 --> 04:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
and they have to go back 36 whatever
 
04:09:29.309 --> 04:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
times a year um it's just uncalled for
 
04:09:31.149 --> 04:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
and also if there's a power outage or
 
04:09:32.630 --> 04:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
storm or something or there's a closure
 
04:09:34.910 --> 04:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
of a store a lot of pharmacies right now
 
04:09:37.630 --> 04:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
are having problems Staffing and and
 
04:09:39.550 --> 04:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
some are restricting their hours some
 
04:09:41.070 --> 04:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
are closed more frequently or if there
 
04:09:42.590 --> 04:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
isn't if they have to close because they
 
04:09:43.790 --> 04:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
can't even get a pharmacist to show up
 
04:09:45.910 --> 04:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
now I know this is Pharmacy and not
 
04:09:48.910 --> 04:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
other Pharmacy but um if a pharmacy is
 
04:09:50.670 --> 04:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
closed or they can't you know for some
 
04:09:52.269 --> 04:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
reason you can't get there or it's after
 
04:09:54.590 --> 04:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
hours there are 24-hour phes I may have
 
04:09:56.790 --> 04:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
to drive 40 minutes or you know 35
 
04:09:58.710 --> 04:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
minutes to get there but if you need to
 
04:10:00.590 --> 04:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
get a 24-hour pharmacy you'll be able to
 
04:10:02.309 --> 04:10:02.319 align:start position:0%
eventually get there there are no
 
04:10:06.389 --> 04:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
24-hour cannabis places anywhere yet
 
04:10:08.389 --> 04:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
sorry didn't mean to spill that anyway
 
04:10:10.670 --> 04:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
um so I think this is really important
 
04:10:12.750 --> 04:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to take any questions
 
04:10:15.389 --> 04:10:15.399 align:start position:0%
and please pass this Bill thank you are
 
04:10:17.149 --> 04:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
they any questions from the
 
04:10:19.229 --> 04:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
04:10:20.389 --> 04:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
much and I'll call back uh
 
04:10:20.399 --> 04:10:22.870 align:start position:0%
much and I'll call back uh
representative

04:10:22.870 --> 04:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:10:26.590 --> 04:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:29.469 --> 04:10:29.479 align:start position:0%
you yeah I just wanted to um explain a
 
04:10:31.149 --> 04:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
little bit more about Edibles the
 
04:10:34.469 --> 04:10:34.479 align:start position:0%
question about Edibles um most if not
 
04:10:38.790 --> 04:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
all dispensaries um have syringes of
 
04:10:41.670 --> 04:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
concentrate and each syringe syringe is
 
04:10:44.109 --> 04:10:44.119 align:start position:0%
about 100 milligrams so if you're if
 
04:10:45.550 --> 04:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
you're like me and I want to know
 
04:10:47.550 --> 04:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
exactly how much I'm taking because I'm
 
04:10:49.830 --> 04:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
very sensitive to cannabis and I don't I
 
04:10:51.550 --> 04:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
actually I don't want to be high I don't
 
04:10:55.630 --> 04:10:55.640 align:start position:0%
like that feeling um so what I can do is
 
04:10:59.070 --> 04:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
I can take that syringe make um a plate
 
04:11:01.030 --> 04:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
of brownies we all heard about that in
 
04:11:03.710 --> 04:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
college right and if you cut it into 20
 
04:11:06.590 --> 04:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
pieces then each piece is 5 milligrams
 
04:11:08.830 --> 04:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
more or less you know I mean depend on
 
04:11:11.870 --> 04:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
on how well you um you stir it um
 
04:11:15.429 --> 04:11:15.439 align:start position:0%
another way to to use um cannabis and
 
04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
Edibles is to decarbox it which means to
 
04:11:21.710 --> 04:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
heat the flour up because once you heat
 
04:11:24.269 --> 04:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
the flour that's what activates the THC
 
04:11:27.229 --> 04:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
that's why people smoke cannabis if you
 
04:11:30.109 --> 04:11:30.119 align:start position:0%
eat raw cannabis you're not going to get
 
04:11:32.389 --> 04:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
inebriated you might get you might get a
 
04:11:34.349 --> 04:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
little calm from the CBD but you're not
 
04:11:37.349 --> 04:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
going to get inebriated so you you decar
 
04:11:39.670 --> 04:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
carboxilate the flour and then you can
 
04:11:41.590 --> 04:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
use the flour in food some people
 
04:11:44.590 --> 04:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
sprinkle it on top again I don't do that
 
04:11:46.070 --> 04:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
because I want to know exactly how much
 
04:11:48.389 --> 04:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
I'm taking um and
 
04:11:52.030 --> 04:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
lastly when you are smoking the flour a
 
04:11:55.830 --> 04:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
healthy Bowl um and that's you know
 
04:11:58.070 --> 04:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
typically what you see in in you know on
 
04:12:00.109 --> 04:12:00.119 align:start position:0%
screen in movies and stuff a healthy
 
04:12:02.550 --> 04:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
bowl is about 20 milligrams of of
 
04:12:05.630 --> 04:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis in it way way way too much for
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
me so I use something called a one
 
04:12:10.590 --> 04:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
hitter that has a bowl that is about the
 
04:12:13.950 --> 04:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
size of the Eraser on a pencil that's
 
04:12:16.469 --> 04:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
how much I use I mean and and it does
 
04:12:21.269 --> 04:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
the job so um so so people use this in
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
different ways and you need the product
 
04:12:25.710 --> 04:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
to make
 
04:12:29.389 --> 04:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
edibles yes question from sort of the
 
04:12:32.269 --> 04:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
gist of my question was you you sort of
 
04:12:36.429 --> 04:12:36.439 align:start position:0%
the 100 milligram syringe is that's 100
 
04:12:38.189 --> 04:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
milligrams is close to 4 ounces would
 
04:12:39.670 --> 04:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
that be the kind of limit of what
 
04:12:44.269 --> 04:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
somebody could buy or no so the the the
 
04:12:48.229 --> 04:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
the four grams is the raw 100 milligrams
 
04:12:51.070 --> 04:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not 100 milligrams is not
 
04:12:53.790 --> 04:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
grams I'm never mind yeah milligrams no
 
04:12:55.710 --> 04:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
we're talking milligrams you could get a
 
04:12:57.510 --> 04:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
you could get a lot of syringes you
 
04:13:00.030 --> 04:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
could get right I'm I'm off by a factor
 
04:13:04.030 --> 04:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
of um 100
 
04:13:04.040 --> 04:13:05.670 align:start position:0%
of um 100
yeah

04:13:05.670 --> 04:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:13:07.670 --> 04:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
math I was just
 
04:13:10.429 --> 04:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
and I'm it was just sounding like very
 
04:13:15.030 --> 04:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
little in grams but now I got it no it's
 
04:13:17.429 --> 04:13:17.439 align:start position:0%
uh been a long day and getting getting
 
04:13:19.910 --> 04:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
those different orders of magnitude when
 
04:13:21.189 --> 04:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
you're when you're converting between
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
all of these it's hard to keep straight
 
04:13:25.590 --> 04:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
unless you're writing it down
 
04:13:28.469 --> 04:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
so well and if you're not a patient this
 
04:13:30.309 --> 04:13:30.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't this may not make sense to you
 
04:13:32.710 --> 04:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
because you don't have to do this but as
 
04:13:35.590 --> 04:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
patients this is what we do so that we
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
can go and we can go to work work we can
 
04:13:39.790 --> 04:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
raise our families we can go buy
 
04:13:41.870 --> 04:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
groceries and cook I mean this is what
 
04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
we have to do to be well enough to
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
participate thank you that was very
 
04:13:50.830 --> 04:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
helpful um if there are no other cards
 
04:13:52.590 --> 04:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
um I will close the public hearing on
 
04:13:54.070 --> 04:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:13:56.510 --> 04:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
1350 and uh since we've already moved
 
04:13:59.429 --> 04:13:59.439 align:start position:0%
into the time frame for House Bill
 
04:14:02.510 --> 04:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
12:31 um sorry no we're not there yet
 
04:14:04.309 --> 04:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
we've moved in the time frame for House
 
04:14:06.710 --> 04:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
Bill 1581 I'm not sure if we have any
 
04:14:08.429 --> 04:14:08.439 align:start position:0%
cards for that one yet but I'd love to
 
04:14:33.189 --> 04:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:35.750 --> 04:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
cards thank you and with that I will
 
04:14:38.910 --> 04:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on house Bill 1581 and
 
04:14:40.630 --> 04:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
call Prime sponsor representative
 
04:14:50.269 --> 04:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:53.189 --> 04:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
speak thank you madam chair and um thank
 
04:14:55.710 --> 04:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
you to the committee for spending this
 
04:14:57.910 --> 04:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
day listening to some of the bills that
 
04:15:00.349 --> 04:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
we've been working on and and really
 
04:15:02.550 --> 04:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
exploring the program um just as a
 
04:15:05.070 --> 04:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned that I sent out to you all of
 
04:15:08.030 --> 04:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
you um something that was shared with me
 
04:15:10.670 --> 04:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
which was um a
 
04:15:12.830 --> 04:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
presentation by and about the
 
04:15:15.710 --> 04:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabus program and that
 
04:15:19.870 --> 04:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
was presented to um the 611 Commission
 
04:15:19.880 --> 04:15:20.790 align:start position:0%
was presented to um the 611 Commission
on

04:15:20.790 --> 04:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:15:24.590 --> 04:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
legalizing um for adult recreational use
 
04:15:26.389 --> 04:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
so that information about the
 
04:15:28.590 --> 04:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
therapeutic canab program is really good
 
04:15:30.790 --> 04:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
backdrop to what we're working on today
 
04:15:32.950 --> 04:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
and just to urge your committee to
 
04:15:35.790 --> 04:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
continue to protect the therapeutic
 
04:15:37.990 --> 04:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis program for for the patients as
 
04:15:41.070 --> 04:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
we move ahead um with our state's ideas
 
04:15:44.349 --> 04:15:44.359 align:start position:0%
about what will be their therap their
 
04:15:46.389 --> 04:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
non- theraputic cannabis program so
 
04:15:48.469 --> 04:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for keeping us in the context
 
04:15:50.910 --> 04:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
and please understand that we really
 
04:15:54.030 --> 04:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
fiercely defend our program the bill
 
04:15:55.830 --> 04:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
that I have before you now which is
 
04:16:00.109 --> 04:16:00.119 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1581 is very simple um if you
 
04:16:02.510 --> 04:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
look at the analysis on the front page
 
04:16:06.109 --> 04:16:06.119 align:start position:0%
it says this bill allows a second uh
 
04:16:08.710 --> 04:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
cultivation to be considered for
 
04:16:10.429 --> 04:16:10.439 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment
 
04:16:12.950 --> 04:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
centers um that really should say this
 
04:16:12.960 --> 04:16:13.990 align:start position:0%
centers um that really should say this
bill

04:16:13.990 --> 04:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:16:17.389 --> 04:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
allows additional cultivation
 
04:16:19.990 --> 04:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
centers because if you flip the bill
 
04:16:22.269 --> 04:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
over and you look at the other side um
 
04:16:23.990 --> 04:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
the paper over and you look at the first
 
04:16:27.070 --> 04:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
page of the bill it it basically tells
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
you that the department May authorize an
 
04:16:32.590 --> 04:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment center to operate
 
04:16:35.750 --> 04:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
additional cultivation locations which
 
04:16:38.229 --> 04:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
may be a greenhouse house and which
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
shall be subject to the rules adopted by
 
04:16:42.830 --> 04:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
the department under RSA
 
04:16:45.070 --> 04:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
126x colon
 
04:16:49.510 --> 04:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
6 um section three and all applicable
 
04:16:51.670 --> 04:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
provisions of this chapter that are
 
04:16:55.510 --> 04:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
already in there apply to having the
 
04:16:58.389 --> 04:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
greenhouse so in terms of what we do now
 
04:17:00.429 --> 04:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
and what this would change what we do
 
04:17:02.269 --> 04:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
now is we have a grow house it is
 
04:17:05.429 --> 04:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
completely enclosed there is no sunlight
 
04:17:07.750 --> 04:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
interacting with the therap cannabis
 
04:17:10.189 --> 04:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
planting material that's being grown
 
04:17:13.590 --> 04:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
there um and in this
 
04:17:17.790 --> 04:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
facility there is High Press um lighting
 
04:17:21.309 --> 04:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
and um items that are used to raise the
 
04:17:23.750 --> 04:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis plants but in an in an
 
04:17:26.750 --> 04:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
unnatural situation with a greenhouse
 
04:17:29.830 --> 04:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
you would not only curtail the carbon
 
04:17:32.630 --> 04:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
footprint of the um alternative
 
04:17:34.550 --> 04:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
treatment centers but you would be using
 
04:17:37.870 --> 04:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
natural sunlight to grow the cannabis
 
04:17:39.830 --> 04:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
plants and
 
04:17:43.030 --> 04:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
um all of the things that go with doing
 
04:17:46.229 --> 04:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
this the natural way also come under the
 
04:17:49.309 --> 04:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
same exact applicable Provisions that
 
04:17:52.030 --> 04:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
the growhouse is under right now so in
 
04:17:55.349 --> 04:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
terms of security um interfacing with
 
04:17:58.590 --> 04:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
the town in which the cultivation Center
 
04:17:58.600 --> 04:17:59.389 align:start position:0%
the town in which the cultivation Center
is

04:17:59.389 --> 04:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:18:02.910 --> 04:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
located um the applicable the
 
04:18:05.590 --> 04:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
application of the rules by the
 
04:18:08.830 --> 04:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
department and by the
 
04:18:11.429 --> 04:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
program should not be imp this there
 
04:18:14.229 --> 04:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
should be no impact to this
 
04:18:18.030 --> 04:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
um the local governing town or body of
 
04:18:21.269 --> 04:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
the city or town where the additional
 
04:18:24.269 --> 04:18:24.279 align:start position:0%
cultivation location would be located we
 
04:18:26.149 --> 04:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
would be soliciting input from
 
04:18:28.469 --> 04:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
qualifying patients designated
 
04:18:30.790 --> 04:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
caregivers and residents of the town or
 
04:18:33.149 --> 04:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
city just as we would if we were opening
 
04:18:35.790 --> 04:18:35.800 align:start position:0%
up a new dispensary in the area but this
 
04:18:40.429 --> 04:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:43.109 --> 04:18:43.119 align:start position:0%
cultivation actually it's loosing it up
 
04:18:45.910 --> 04:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
by adding a greenhouse and allowing
 
04:18:49.349 --> 04:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
these the greenhouse would be just for
 
04:18:52.030 --> 04:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
cultivation so before I mumble on a
 
04:18:54.429 --> 04:18:54.439 align:start position:0%
little longer I just want to open it up
 
04:18:56.550 --> 04:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
to questions there's people that have
 
04:19:00.670 --> 04:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
more um Salient information about the
 
04:19:02.710 --> 04:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
amount of utilities that the way we do
 
04:19:05.670 --> 04:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
it now requires versus the way this
 
04:19:08.189 --> 04:19:08.199 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to them particularly
 
04:19:09.910 --> 04:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any
 
04:19:12.189 --> 04:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
questions representative Missour and
 
04:19:13.670 --> 04:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
then representative mle after Missour
 
04:19:16.630 --> 04:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um thank you for
 
04:19:18.309 --> 04:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question actually it's
 
04:19:20.750 --> 04:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
actually a point of clarity so you
 
04:19:23.670 --> 04:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the analysis should read
 
04:19:26.950 --> 04:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
this bill allows instead of that word
 
04:19:26.960 --> 04:19:28.550 align:start position:0%
this bill allows instead of that word
second

04:19:28.550 --> 04:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:19:31.389 --> 04:19:31.399 align:start position:0%
additional so to me those are two very
 
04:19:34.269 --> 04:19:34.279 align:start position:0%
different words so if we're allowing a
 
04:19:37.830 --> 04:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
second cultivation Center and if if
 
04:19:39.710 --> 04:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
you're and correct me if I'm wrong if
 
04:19:41.429 --> 04:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
you said that should say this bill
 
04:19:44.830 --> 04:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
allows additional cultivation centers
 
04:19:47.189 --> 04:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
those are different things so can you
 
04:19:50.030 --> 04:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
clarify what you meant by
 
04:19:52.750 --> 04:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
that yes I can and thanks that's a good
 
04:19:56.670 --> 04:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
question um I'm just noticing that when
 
04:19:59.030 --> 04:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're noticing this line
 
04:20:01.710 --> 04:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
in the analysis doesn't match the text
 
04:20:03.990 --> 04:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill and
 
04:20:07.710 --> 04:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
so I made reference to it as an error
 
04:20:10.590 --> 04:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
because I would hope that if we move
 
04:20:14.229 --> 04:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
ahead with this that that goes over to
 
04:20:19.349 --> 04:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:23.670 --> 04:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
error do you have a followup or no so
 
04:20:26.189 --> 04:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
what happens with that then what how do
 
04:20:29.590 --> 04:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
we fix that before it moves on may I ask
 
04:20:31.630 --> 04:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
you to send an email to OSS and let us
 
04:20:33.070 --> 04:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
know what you find out because I think
 
04:20:34.750 --> 04:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
it'd be a great idea for us to be able
 
04:20:37.349 --> 04:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
to correct these when necessary on that
 
04:20:40.790 --> 04:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
on that sorry is that me or is that
 
04:20:43.189 --> 04:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative maor okay not
 
04:20:45.510 --> 04:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
Representative no no not at all if you
 
04:20:47.309 --> 04:20:47.319 align:start position:0%
want me to comment I can but if you
 
04:20:49.630 --> 04:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
don't need me to that's fine I just um
 
04:20:51.790 --> 04:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
this is a mistake in the drafting that's
 
04:20:54.550 --> 04:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
the way I see that and and so yes
 
04:20:57.189 --> 04:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
clarifying that um my understanding is
 
04:20:58.469 --> 04:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
that the bill
 
04:21:01.269 --> 04:21:01.279 align:start position:0%
text takes all precedence over any
 
04:21:03.590 --> 04:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
analysis statement but that I could be
 
04:21:05.590 --> 04:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
wrong about that and it would be
 
04:21:07.349 --> 04:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
judicious to get
 
04:21:10.269 --> 04:21:10.279 align:start position:0%
the um information directly from Office
 
04:21:12.710 --> 04:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
of legislative Services y thank you
 
04:21:14.630 --> 04:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mlan and then
 
04:21:14.640 --> 04:21:15.990 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mlan and then
representative

04:21:15.990 --> 04:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:21:19.109 --> 04:21:19.119 align:start position:0%
Shapiro uh thank you Madame CH chair and
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
04:21:22.349 --> 04:21:22.359 align:start position:0%
I remember when we first brought in an
 
04:21:25.630 --> 04:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
ATC into Manchester we had the the
 
04:21:28.349 --> 04:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
public hearings and one of the things
 
04:21:30.630 --> 04:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
that everybody was reassured about at
 
04:21:33.429 --> 04:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
the time that that Center came in is in
 
04:21:35.630 --> 04:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
fact it was brought in with great
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
secrecy nobody nobody even we knew it
 
04:21:40.189 --> 04:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
was in the district but nobody knew
 
04:21:42.510 --> 04:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
where and they said it's it's it's going
 
04:21:44.950 --> 04:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
to be nondescript nobody's going to know
 
04:21:46.910 --> 04:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's there it's not going to you know
 
04:21:49.269 --> 04:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
present you know any interest to the
 
04:21:52.070 --> 04:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
community at all because it's boom um
 
04:21:53.550 --> 04:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
and this is going to be changing all
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be a greenhouse it's
 
04:21:58.030 --> 04:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
going to be much more visible um so is
 
04:22:01.189 --> 04:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
there any was any of that taken into
 
04:22:03.229 --> 04:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
account I mean I understand the argument
 
04:22:05.189 --> 04:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
that hey it's going to be more energy
 
04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
efficient and things of this nature but
 
04:22:09.309 --> 04:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
the other concerns that were kind of
 
04:22:11.349 --> 04:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
brought up when the atcs were first
 
04:22:14.870 --> 04:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
brought in um is there any reason that
 
04:22:16.510 --> 04:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
we're we're comfortable moving beyond
 
04:22:19.550 --> 04:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
that at this point do you
 
04:22:22.189 --> 04:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
know I think that's a really good
 
04:22:24.510 --> 04:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
question um I think that we can be
 
04:22:26.429 --> 04:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
comfortable moving beyond that at this
 
04:22:29.550 --> 04:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
point because we're giving the um
 
04:22:32.950 --> 04:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to the ATC to lower patient
 
04:22:37.109 --> 04:22:37.119 align:start position:0%
cost and to and find a better way to
 
04:22:39.590 --> 04:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
make the products and that helps the
 
04:22:42.429 --> 04:22:42.439 align:start position:0%
program all the way around but each and
 
04:22:44.309 --> 04:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
every step of the way there's been a
 
04:22:46.670 --> 04:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
public hearing before any kind of
 
04:22:49.830 --> 04:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
structure has been allowed to impact a
 
04:22:52.229 --> 04:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
community and
 
04:22:54.189 --> 04:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
I'm the
 
04:22:57.189 --> 04:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
nondescript type of location and the the
 
04:22:57.199 --> 04:22:58.670 align:start position:0%
nondescript type of location and the the
whole

04:22:58.670 --> 04:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
whole
 
04:23:02.149 --> 04:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
discret um and health protected
 
04:23:04.429 --> 04:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
information is certainly going to be
 
04:23:08.070 --> 04:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
taken and considered by the atcs and if
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's not the public is going to make
 
04:23:12.189 --> 04:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
them aware of any concerns and any kind
 
04:23:12.199 --> 04:23:13.229 align:start position:0%
them aware of any concerns and any kind
of

04:23:13.229 --> 04:23:13.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:23:13.239 --> 04:23:15.510 align:start position:0%
of
discretionary

04:23:15.510 --> 04:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
discretionary
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
um approaches they would
 
04:23:21.349 --> 04:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
take thank you so um and for any new
 
04:23:23.269 --> 04:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
installations it it's enabling it allows
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
you to put in and it will go through the
 
04:23:27.670 --> 04:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
whole public hearing process kind of
 
04:23:30.309 --> 04:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
thing it talks about that but for
 
04:23:30.319 --> 04:23:31.950 align:start position:0%
thing it talks about that but for
existing

04:23:31.950 --> 04:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
existing
 
04:23:36.030 --> 04:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
facilities um if you wanted to convert
 
04:23:36.040 --> 04:23:37.149 align:start position:0%
facilities um if you wanted to convert
them

04:23:37.149 --> 04:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:23:39.229 --> 04:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
um would that conversion go through the
 
04:23:40.710 --> 04:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
same process they would have to come
 
04:23:42.790 --> 04:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
back and go back to the community again
 
04:23:44.670 --> 04:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
and engage them we want to convert it
 
04:23:47.349 --> 04:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
from the state it's in now to like for
 
04:23:49.710 --> 04:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
example a greenhouse state with the
 
04:23:51.469 --> 04:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
existing facilities where they also have
 
04:23:53.750 --> 04:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
to go through that same process is that
 
04:23:53.760 --> 04:23:54.630 align:start position:0%
to go through that same process is that
the

04:23:54.630 --> 04:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:57.830 --> 04:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
intention if they wanted to change from
 
04:23:59.590 --> 04:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
having the grow house that they have
 
04:24:02.349 --> 04:24:02.359 align:start position:0%
right now which I didn't hear I heard
 
04:24:04.550 --> 04:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
that what what would be helpful is if
 
04:24:07.030 --> 04:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
they were to because they want to be
 
04:24:09.510 --> 04:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
able to increase their production and we
 
04:24:12.309 --> 04:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
want to make more access to the products
 
04:24:14.710 --> 04:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
for the public we want to them to be
 
04:24:16.710 --> 04:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
able to get the certification but we
 
04:24:18.550 --> 04:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
also want them to have the benefit of
 
04:24:22.349 --> 04:24:22.359 align:start position:0%
the price points and right now um so
 
04:24:24.309 --> 04:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
what we're asking you know would the
 
04:24:27.790 --> 04:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
atc's move away from having a grow house
 
04:24:30.349 --> 04:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
that's you know probably costing like
 
04:24:33.790 --> 04:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
$20,000 a month to put these
 
04:24:36.229 --> 04:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
high-intensity lights and build up theat
 
04:24:39.030 --> 04:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
heat and then try to take that heat and
 
04:24:42.149 --> 04:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
cool the place back down I so they have
 
04:24:43.990 --> 04:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
to think about what they I you know I
 
04:24:45.710 --> 04:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't under the understanding that
 
04:24:47.870 --> 04:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
people would convert what they have now
 
04:24:49.910 --> 04:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
but that this would be additional grow
 
04:24:54.670 --> 04:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
houses um cultivation centers really and
 
04:24:57.109 --> 04:24:57.119 align:start position:0%
if it were to be a greenhouse I I just
 
04:24:58.830 --> 04:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
don't see how that would be really
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
different in terms of like it can be
 
04:25:04.389 --> 04:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
discreet it can be as as secure in my
 
04:25:08.950 --> 04:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
mind thank you thank you representative
 
04:25:11.750 --> 04:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you madam
 
04:25:15.590 --> 04:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
chair what what is the main impetus for
 
04:25:18.030 --> 04:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill or making this change
 
04:25:23.389 --> 04:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
is it Financial is it ecological is it
 
04:25:26.710 --> 04:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
somehow the quality of the Cannabis that
 
04:25:27.790 --> 04:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
will be
 
04:25:32.950 --> 04:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
grown is it all the what is what is the
 
04:25:35.389 --> 04:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
motivating factor towards making this
 
04:25:35.399 --> 04:25:38.349 align:start position:0%
motivating factor towards making this
change

04:25:38.349 --> 04:25:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:42.429 --> 04:25:42.439 align:start position:0%
I can say as a legislator and a patient
 
04:25:44.950 --> 04:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
of the therapeutic cannabis program that
 
04:25:46.950 --> 04:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
I think this will be helpful for a lot
 
04:25:49.189 --> 04:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
of the things that where they just want
 
04:25:53.950 --> 04:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
to grow and perhaps bring some of
 
04:25:57.910 --> 04:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
the what their results are just from
 
04:26:00.070 --> 04:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
cultivation standpoint and not
 
04:26:02.670 --> 04:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily be working on the synthesis
 
04:26:06.070 --> 04:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
of products in any additional facilities
 
04:26:07.630 --> 04:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
so they would still need to have a
 
04:26:11.469 --> 04:26:11.479 align:start position:0%
facility where they use energy and they
 
04:26:14.990 --> 04:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
convert the products from raw plant into
 
04:26:17.389 --> 04:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
the different products that they have on
 
04:26:21.389 --> 04:26:21.399 align:start position:0%
their menu um but at the same
 
04:26:25.309 --> 04:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
time they would be able to grow more
 
04:26:27.269 --> 04:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
economically they would be able to have
 
04:26:30.389 --> 04:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
an additional location I think when you
 
04:26:32.229 --> 04:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
think about the carbon
 
04:26:34.870 --> 04:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
footprint that's another argument in
 
04:26:36.790 --> 04:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
favor of this because is really the way
 
04:26:38.790 --> 04:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
what we do right now is we we don't have
 
04:26:41.670 --> 04:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
any natural sunlight coming in we just
 
04:26:46.710 --> 04:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
have grow lights and we have the the air
 
04:26:48.910 --> 04:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
circulation system and that's what we're
 
04:26:52.030 --> 04:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
working with so
 
04:26:55.269 --> 04:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
um I think the impetus is to help the
 
04:26:57.830 --> 04:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
dispensaries to grow more product at a
 
04:27:00.349 --> 04:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
better price but the other things are
 
04:27:03.030 --> 04:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
very hard to tease out because there
 
04:27:03.040 --> 04:27:04.910 align:start position:0%
very hard to tease out because there
benefits

04:27:04.910 --> 04:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
04:27:08.710 --> 04:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely you know to the environment
 
04:27:11.790 --> 04:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
and followup
 
04:27:14.229 --> 04:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
followup you know I don't really know
 
04:27:17.189 --> 04:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
about this but so this is just what I've
 
04:27:22.750 --> 04:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:26.990 --> 04:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
about the odor that comes from um the
 
04:27:30.349 --> 04:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
growing of cannabis and I mostly read
 
04:27:32.670 --> 04:27:32.680 align:start position:0%
articles in like about California where
 
04:27:34.550 --> 04:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
there were some you know those were
 
04:27:37.189 --> 04:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
illegal um
 
04:27:39.990 --> 04:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
growing but that in some neighborhoods
 
04:27:43.910 --> 04:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
where a lot of marijuana was grown that
 
04:27:46.710 --> 04:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
the neighborhoods were so affected by
 
04:27:46.720 --> 04:27:47.469 align:start position:0%
the neighborhoods were so affected by
the

04:27:47.469 --> 04:27:47.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:27:51.990 --> 04:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
smell in a negative way um and
 
04:27:54.590 --> 04:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
so so I've never heard that brought up
 
04:27:57.030 --> 04:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
in in terms of New Hampshire and the
 
04:27:59.910 --> 04:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
growing the grow houses that exist here
 
04:28:02.309 --> 04:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
is that an issue and if it is an issue
 
04:28:04.309 --> 04:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
would it be more of an issue if it was
 
04:28:07.790 --> 04:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
done in a more um you know in a
 
04:28:10.229 --> 04:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
greenhouse rather than a self-contained
 
04:28:12.149 --> 04:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
building and you maybe you don't know
 
04:28:16.149 --> 04:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
about this or or maybe I'm off the Mark
 
04:28:18.269 --> 04:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
I don't know not at all um no
 
04:28:20.030 --> 04:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you for the
 
04:28:23.070 --> 04:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
question and no I think that's that's a
 
04:28:26.349 --> 04:28:26.359 align:start position:0%
really good question I'm at this point
 
04:28:27.870 --> 04:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:28:31.630 --> 04:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
not um on the property of the grow house
 
04:28:33.469 --> 04:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
that they have right now but there are
 
04:28:37.269 --> 04:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
people in the room who are and who can
 
04:28:39.750 --> 04:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps help all of us like have more
 
04:28:41.189 --> 04:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
firsthand knowledge about the
 
04:28:43.830 --> 04:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program including
 
04:28:45.830 --> 04:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
like myself being able to go to the grow
 
04:28:48.429 --> 04:28:48.439 align:start position:0%
house and find out but following my
 
04:28:50.229 --> 04:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
testimony there are a couple people here
 
04:28:52.870 --> 04:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
that can probably take that question and
 
04:28:55.309 --> 04:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
swiftly deal with
 
04:28:57.710 --> 04:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
it better than me and I'll actually
 
04:28:59.429 --> 04:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
interject here as chair um in
 
04:29:01.750 --> 04:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the adult use um Bill
 
04:29:04.070 --> 04:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
there have been some um cultivators who
 
04:29:05.990 --> 04:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
have offered to provide tours for people
 
04:29:07.990 --> 04:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
who want to understand this more um I
 
04:29:09.389 --> 04:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
don't know if those who are growing with
 
04:29:11.349 --> 04:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
the atcs will be able to make a similar
 
04:29:13.630 --> 04:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
offer um but that's something where so
 
04:29:15.349 --> 04:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
that we could be more knowledgeable
 
04:29:18.469 --> 04:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
about what we are increasing access to
 
04:29:19.790 --> 04:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
anybody on this committee who's
 
04:29:21.229 --> 04:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
interested in learning more about the
 
04:29:23.149 --> 04:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
actual process I could help coordinate
 
04:29:25.670 --> 04:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
that either through um those in Maine
 
04:29:27.389 --> 04:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
who have offered up the opportunity or
 
04:29:29.429 --> 04:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
if the atcs are interested in doing that
 
04:29:31.149 --> 04:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
here so I think I think that would
 
04:29:32.469 --> 04:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
answer a lot of the questions that you
 
04:29:34.429 --> 04:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
have because I did take a tour of one
 
04:29:36.189 --> 04:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
and it's not what I read on to read on
 
04:29:40.269 --> 04:29:40.279 align:start position:0%
in the newspapers and see on TV so and I
 
04:29:42.429 --> 04:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
can just if you don't mind Madam chair I
 
04:29:45.790 --> 04:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
can just um reiterate that with that we
 
04:29:47.830 --> 04:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of interest in finding out
 
04:29:51.269 --> 04:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
more about about what we're doing and
 
04:29:53.550 --> 04:29:53.560 align:start position:0%
there are more opportunities for the
 
04:29:55.670 --> 04:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
house and house members and the Health
 
04:29:58.429 --> 04:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
and Human Services committee to engage
 
04:30:00.510 --> 04:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
and find out what exactly we're doing so
 
04:30:03.070 --> 04:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
that you know where we're going with the
 
04:30:05.830 --> 04:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
program and what our vision is because
 
04:30:08.790 --> 04:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
come in and as representative Thomas
 
04:30:10.510 --> 04:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
said we come in and we we're looking at
 
04:30:12.910 --> 04:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
things peace meal a little bit at a time
 
04:30:14.910 --> 04:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
and it's a big
 
04:30:16.910 --> 04:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
picture thank you for that are there
 
04:30:18.630 --> 04:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
other questions from the
 
04:30:20.790 --> 04:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
committee okay seeing none thank you
 
04:30:31.710 --> 04:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:35.229 --> 04:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
Thomas hi again uh representative Wendy
 
04:30:37.389 --> 04:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
Thomas town of marac um a few things I
 
04:30:39.910 --> 04:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify from the previous
 
04:30:41.870 --> 04:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
statement um I think there's some
 
04:30:44.990 --> 04:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
confusion because they do not grow at
 
04:30:48.750 --> 04:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
the atc's at the at the ATC proper it is
 
04:30:51.389 --> 04:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
a storefront where they sell the the the
 
04:30:54.870 --> 04:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
flower the the products they grow in a
 
04:30:57.630 --> 04:30:57.640 align:start position:0%
cultivation facility that is
 
04:31:00.670 --> 04:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
offsite so they don't so in your
 
04:31:03.790 --> 04:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
hypothetical situation the ATC to the
 
04:31:05.870 --> 04:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
best of my knowledge anyway would not be
 
04:31:08.070 --> 04:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
setting up a greenhouse like Outback or
 
04:31:09.590 --> 04:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
anything like
 
04:31:12.750 --> 04:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
that right right so this is this
 
04:31:14.830 --> 04:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
has I was going to say it has nothing to
 
04:31:16.950 --> 04:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
do with the atcs but the ATC is a
 
04:31:20.990 --> 04:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
storefront the growing happens off off
 
04:31:23.550 --> 04:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
property correct they work in
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
conjunction um and to answer the
 
04:31:27.990 --> 04:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
question of why we would need a bill
 
04:31:31.590 --> 04:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
like this um we've just spent the whole
 
04:31:35.349 --> 04:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
day talking about adding different
 
04:31:38.550 --> 04:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
different different symptoms anxiety
 
04:31:41.389 --> 04:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
Eating Disorders um a bill that you just
 
04:31:44.750 --> 04:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
passed 20 Z thank you very much um that
 
04:31:47.149 --> 04:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
would allow Physicians to p uh to
 
04:31:50.429 --> 04:31:50.439 align:start position:0%
recommend for any condition so what
 
04:31:52.990 --> 04:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is opening up this
 
04:31:55.109 --> 04:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
program making it bigger if we're going
 
04:31:57.790 --> 04:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
to do that we need more
 
04:32:01.990 --> 04:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
product allowing the the atcs to have a
 
04:32:03.910 --> 04:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
greenhouse means they don't have to set
 
04:32:05.790 --> 04:32:05.800 align:start position:0%
up a whole building it's a it's sort of
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
a a faster way to get this done it's not
 
04:32:12.389 --> 04:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
so I mean it's just it increases the
 
04:32:14.870 --> 04:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
floor space for for creating more
 
04:32:17.710 --> 04:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
product for for planting
 
04:32:20.710 --> 04:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is that I will tell
 
04:32:23.870 --> 04:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
you that with the release of this HHS uh
 
04:32:26.990 --> 04:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
report descheduling uh or rescheduling I
 
04:32:29.630 --> 04:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
should say cannabis from 1 to three or
 
04:32:31.670 --> 04:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
three to one
 
04:32:34.710 --> 04:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
um so many people have already contacted
 
04:32:37.910 --> 04:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
me um because they know that this isn't
 
04:32:39.510 --> 04:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
my wheelhouse they know that I'm a real
 
04:32:41.870 --> 04:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
Advocate there's going to be tremendous
 
04:32:44.389 --> 04:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
increase in interest and people trying
 
04:32:46.349 --> 04:32:46.359 align:start position:0%
this program because now our federal
 
04:32:48.910 --> 04:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
government is saying hey you know what
 
04:32:50.510 --> 04:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
it's been medicine all along and it's
 
04:32:52.870 --> 04:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
helped a lot of people so I've had so
 
04:32:54.710 --> 04:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
many people contact me and ask me
 
04:32:56.590 --> 04:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
questions how do I get started what do I
 
04:32:58.750 --> 04:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
use what strain you know how do you do
 
04:33:02.429 --> 04:33:02.439 align:start position:0%
this so the atcs as long as we don't
 
04:33:05.070 --> 04:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
have Recreation the atcs are going to
 
04:33:06.269 --> 04:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
have to
 
04:33:08.551 --> 04:33:08.561 align:start position:0%
bump up their production to accommodate
 
04:33:08.561 --> 04:33:10.109 align:start position:0%
bump up their production to accommodate
these

04:33:10.109 --> 04:33:10.119 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
needs oh and the other thing about the
 
04:33:16.310 --> 04:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
smell there was a question about smell
 
04:33:19.230 --> 04:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
so here's the thing you harvest cannabis
 
04:33:20.390 --> 04:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
before it
 
04:33:23.150 --> 04:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
flowers so you're not going to get any
 
04:33:25.470 --> 04:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
kind of a flower smell you're going well
 
04:33:27.189 --> 04:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
we use the word flower you're going to
 
04:33:30.470 --> 04:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
get an organic smell a very sort
 
04:33:33.750 --> 04:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
of like like cut grass smell or
 
04:33:35.869 --> 04:33:35.879 align:start position:0%
something to some of us it it is a
 
04:33:38.470 --> 04:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
lovely lovely smell I I mean I just
 
04:33:42.109 --> 04:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
adore the smell of cannabis I I know I
 
04:33:44.789 --> 04:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
know it's it's a little weird but um it
 
04:33:48.029 --> 04:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not you know a a I mean
 
04:33:49.551 --> 04:33:49.561 align:start position:0%
sometimes when you smoke and especially
 
04:33:52.470 --> 04:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
if you're um smoking the skunky um the
 
04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
skunky strains it can be a little um
 
04:33:59.429 --> 04:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
overpowering but the plant itself is no
 
04:33:59.439 --> 04:34:01.230 align:start position:0%
overpowering but the plant itself is no
no

04:34:01.230 --> 04:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:34:03.990 --> 04:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
more it smells no more worse than tomato
 
04:34:07.590 --> 04:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:09.230 --> 04:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions from
 
04:34:09.240 --> 04:34:10.150 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions from
the

04:34:10.150 --> 04:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:34:12.470 --> 04:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
04:34:15.789 --> 04:34:15.799 align:start position:0%
much uh next I'll call Matt Simon from
 
04:34:24.869 --> 04:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:28.310 --> 04:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you again Madame chair again
 
04:34:30.869 --> 04:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
for the record Matt Simon Granite Leaf
 
04:34:34.750 --> 04:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis um we support this bill I'll
 
04:34:36.269 --> 04:34:36.279 align:start position:0%
begin by answering representative
 
04:34:39.029 --> 04:34:39.039 align:start position:0%
Shapiro's question I the main driving
 
04:34:43.230 --> 04:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
force behind this bill is cost
 
04:34:45.869 --> 04:34:45.879 align:start position:0%
affordability for patients when this law
 
04:34:48.869 --> 04:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
first passed in 2013 it was at the end
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
of a 4year ordeal we had bills passed
 
04:34:55.551 --> 04:34:55.561 align:start position:0%
the House and Senate and vetoed in 2009
 
04:34:55.561 --> 04:34:56.470 align:start position:0%
the House and Senate and vetoed in 2009
and

04:34:56.470 --> 04:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:58.949 --> 04:34:58.959 align:start position:0%
2012 there was strong opposition from
 
04:35:00.990 --> 04:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
the police Chiefs Association and many
 
04:35:03.869 --> 04:35:03.879 align:start position:0%
others there was a climate of fear
 
04:35:07.789 --> 04:35:07.799 align:start position:0%
around this issue so as the law was
 
04:35:09.470 --> 04:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
being implemented there were a number of
 
04:35:11.990 --> 04:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
policy decisions that had to be made
 
04:35:13.789 --> 04:35:13.799 align:start position:0%
that could roughly be described on a
 
04:35:17.629 --> 04:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
spectrum from prioritizing patient care
 
04:35:20.510 --> 04:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
the patient experience low costs high
 
04:35:22.429 --> 04:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
quality and over here there was a
 
04:35:25.310 --> 04:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
concern about security diversion some
 
04:35:26.789 --> 04:35:26.799 align:start position:0%
people were very afraid that the
 
04:35:29.269 --> 04:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
licensed businesses would simply be
 
04:35:31.551 --> 04:35:31.561 align:start position:0%
selling cannabis at the high school and
 
04:35:33.070 --> 04:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
shoving it out the side door and
 
04:35:35.910 --> 04:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
everything so during that implementation
 
04:35:37.949 --> 04:35:37.959 align:start position:0%
period I would describe it charitably as
 
04:35:40.349 --> 04:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
an abundance of caution that led the
 
04:35:43.429 --> 04:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
general court uh to adopt a law and
 
04:35:46.269 --> 04:35:46.279 align:start position:0%
rules that were very restrictive and not
 
04:35:49.230 --> 04:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of patients so patients
 
04:35:51.269 --> 04:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
are aware that prices are lower in
 
04:35:53.949 --> 04:35:53.959 align:start position:0%
neighboring states they wonder why that
 
04:35:56.470 --> 04:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
that is and the number one complaint
 
04:35:57.910 --> 04:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire's therapeutic
 
04:36:01.029 --> 04:36:01.039 align:start position:0%
cannabis program Far and Away has been
 
04:36:03.470 --> 04:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
cost from the very beginning why is it
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
cheaper in Maine than in New Hampshire
 
04:36:07.750 --> 04:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
and there are a number of reasons for
 
04:36:10.709 --> 04:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
that but one of the basic reasons is
 
04:36:13.269 --> 04:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
that neighboring states allow Greenhouse
 
04:36:15.230 --> 04:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
cultivation neighboring states also
 
04:36:17.869 --> 04:36:17.879 align:start position:0%
allow outdoor cultivation that doesn't
 
04:36:20.429 --> 04:36:20.439 align:start position:0%
have to be in a greenhouse they do they
 
04:36:22.109 --> 04:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
have regulations they have security
 
04:36:24.990 --> 04:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
requirements but they have options for
 
04:36:26.789 --> 04:36:26.799 align:start position:0%
cultivators so this is something that's
 
04:36:29.429 --> 04:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
contributed to the high cost of cannabis
 
04:36:32.070 --> 04:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
all along and this would be a way that
 
04:36:34.349 --> 04:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
we could make cannabis somewhat more
 
04:36:35.869 --> 04:36:35.879 align:start position:0%
affordable for p patients in New
 
04:36:38.070 --> 04:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire while reducing our carbon
 
04:36:41.429 --> 04:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
footprint which our production facility
 
04:36:43.029 --> 04:36:43.039 align:start position:0%
is made up of people who grow in
 
04:36:45.310 --> 04:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
processed plants they tend to love the
 
04:36:48.230 --> 04:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
environment and nature and would prefer
 
04:36:50.990 --> 04:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
to be operating uh as environmentally
 
04:36:54.750 --> 04:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
friendly as we can so representative
 
04:36:56.629 --> 04:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
veil's description is correct there are
 
04:37:00.310 --> 04:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
no windows in our production facility um
 
04:37:02.070 --> 04:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
one clarification it's it's a little
 
04:37:05.590 --> 04:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
funny the way the law is written but the
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
companies are
 
04:37:10.590 --> 04:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
atcs as an ATC we have a licensed
 
04:37:13.070 --> 04:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
production facility ours happens to be
 
04:37:15.070 --> 04:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
in Peterboro you could spend hours
 
04:37:16.551 --> 04:37:16.561 align:start position:0%
driving around Peterboro and you would
 
04:37:19.189 --> 04:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
never find it but it is there in a very
 
04:37:19.199 --> 04:37:20.670 align:start position:0%
never find it but it is there in a very
non-descript

04:37:20.670 --> 04:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
non-descript
 
04:37:24.150 --> 04:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
location I will admit that there is a
 
04:37:27.390 --> 04:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
slight uh cannabis smell as you approach
 
04:37:30.189 --> 04:37:30.199 align:start position:0%
that facility uh it is not a strong
 
04:37:32.949 --> 04:37:32.959 align:start position:0%
smell and the key is that nobody gets
 
04:37:34.590 --> 04:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
near our facility except for the people
 
04:37:36.470 --> 04:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
that work there and and contractors who
 
04:37:40.709 --> 04:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
come in we would love to host a tour uh
 
04:37:45.429 --> 04:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
and we've very open to that um uh
 
04:37:50.310 --> 04:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
touring any ATC location uh does require
 
04:37:51.709 --> 04:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
approval in writing from the
 
04:37:52.990 --> 04:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of Health
 
04:37:56.150 --> 04:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
and Human Services so if this committee
 
04:37:57.470 --> 04:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
for example would like to tour our
 
04:37:59.429 --> 04:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
production facility we would be happy to
 
04:38:01.269 --> 04:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
have you we would just have to formally
 
04:38:02.750 --> 04:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
request that through the appropriate
 
04:38:04.990 --> 04:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
channels and we could pick a date and
 
04:38:06.629 --> 04:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
walk you through it I'm sure that would
 
04:38:08.629 --> 04:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
be very educational and happy to have
 
04:38:08.639 --> 04:38:10.390 align:start position:0%
be very educational and happy to have
you

04:38:10.390 --> 04:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:38:13.990 --> 04:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
um so in discussing this bill how to
 
04:38:15.670 --> 04:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
bring it in we actually considered
 
04:38:18.390 --> 04:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
whether to put outdoor in there I assume
 
04:38:20.189 --> 04:38:20.199 align:start position:0%
that the adult use bill will allow
 
04:38:22.510 --> 04:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
outdoor cultivation we don't have a long
 
04:38:24.109 --> 04:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
growing season in New Hampshire but you
 
04:38:26.029 --> 04:38:26.039 align:start position:0%
can get one good season out of a New
 
04:38:28.709 --> 04:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire summer and uh that will be the
 
04:38:31.029 --> 04:38:31.039 align:start position:0%
most cost-effective and Environ
 
04:38:33.590 --> 04:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
environmentally friendly uh product that
 
04:38:35.629 --> 04:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
you can have so
 
04:38:37.230 --> 04:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
uh the committee could choose to add
 
04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
outdoor to to this sentence but I we
 
04:38:43.390 --> 04:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to get it passed and and speaking
 
04:38:45.029 --> 04:38:45.039 align:start position:0%
for granite Leaf we would really like to
 
04:38:47.590 --> 04:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
have a greenhouse that's what we would
 
04:38:49.349 --> 04:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
very much like to pursue for the above
 
04:38:52.709 --> 04:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned reasons and so just adding a
 
04:38:53.990 --> 04:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
greenhouse would be great adding
 
04:38:55.750 --> 04:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
Greenhouse or outdoor that would be
 
04:38:58.789 --> 04:38:58.799 align:start position:0%
great too I'll leave that all to you
 
04:39:02.390 --> 04:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
but more than happy to answer any
 
04:39:04.189 --> 04:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
questions thank you questions from the
 
04:39:05.709 --> 04:39:05.719 align:start position:0%
committee repres restive Nel and then
 
04:39:08.709 --> 04:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
representative Missour thank you Miss
 
04:39:12.109 --> 04:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
chairman Madam chairman I'm
 
04:39:14.750 --> 04:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you for taking my question
 
04:39:18.429 --> 04:39:18.439 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just curious so I actually did I
 
04:39:20.230 --> 04:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
used to be on one of the dispensary
 
04:39:22.150 --> 04:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
boards and I and I actually did tour the
 
04:39:25.109 --> 04:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
facility and what they they what I was
 
04:39:28.029 --> 04:39:28.039 align:start position:0%
struck with was just the sophistication
 
04:39:31.390 --> 04:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
of the growth process and and every
 
04:39:33.949 --> 04:39:33.959 align:start position:0%
variable was controlled the humidity the
 
04:39:35.990 --> 04:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
temperature and into a square foot I
 
04:39:38.590 --> 04:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
mean that that amazed me and they said
 
04:39:40.430 --> 04:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
to me very specifically that that was
 
04:39:42.830 --> 04:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
necessary to create a reproducible
 
04:39:44.788 --> 04:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
product which a pharmaceutical product
 
04:39:47.590 --> 04:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
should be I'm confused when you start
 
04:39:49.910 --> 04:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
going outdoors and into green houses how
 
04:39:52.430 --> 04:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
do you accomplish that and and create a
 
04:39:54.270 --> 04:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
reproducible product so that we make
 
04:39:56.150 --> 04:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
sure people are getting something that
 
04:39:58.750 --> 04:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
they think they're getting yeah so thank
 
04:40:00.110 --> 04:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
you for that question it's a good
 
04:40:02.550 --> 04:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
question uh there are advantages and
 
04:40:04.788 --> 04:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
disadvantages to indoor cultivation
 
04:40:07.350 --> 04:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
versus outdoor cultivation indoors you
 
04:40:09.910 --> 04:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
can control every aspect of the
 
04:40:11.670 --> 04:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
environment you can you're basically
 
04:40:14.788 --> 04:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
recreating nature indoors and tricking a
 
04:40:16.550 --> 04:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
plant into thinking it's summer and then
 
04:40:19.708 --> 04:40:19.718 align:start position:0%
fall and you can control every variable
 
04:40:21.350 --> 04:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
assuming you don't have power outages
 
04:40:23.070 --> 04:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
which we've had some issues over the
 
04:40:27.350 --> 04:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
years uh some complications um I I would
 
04:40:27.360 --> 04:40:28.310 align:start position:0%
years uh some complications um I I would
say

04:40:28.310 --> 04:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:40:30.990 --> 04:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
that some cannabis will always be grown
 
04:40:32.948 --> 04:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
indoors we're not proposing to move all
 
04:40:35.430 --> 04:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
of our cultivation Outdoors
 
04:40:35.440 --> 04:40:37.390 align:start position:0%
of our cultivation Outdoors
uh

04:40:37.390 --> 04:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:40:42.708 --> 04:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
the highest and most high quality flour
 
04:40:45.750 --> 04:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
will always be produced indoors under
 
04:40:49.270 --> 04:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
lights uh this would
 
04:40:53.550 --> 04:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
enable more cultivation of products that
 
04:40:55.470 --> 04:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
most of which will be made into other
 
04:40:57.510 --> 04:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
products so there there's this is where
 
04:41:00.350 --> 04:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
the independent lab testing comes in
 
04:41:03.310 --> 04:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
every batch of cannabis that we grow has
 
04:41:06.510 --> 04:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
to be tested by an independent lab for
 
04:41:09.070 --> 04:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
the canabo we also test for the tarpine
 
04:41:11.230 --> 04:41:11.240 align:start position:0%
content and for a wide range of
 
04:41:13.868 --> 04:41:13.878 align:start position:0%
contaminants as required by state law so
 
04:41:15.430 --> 04:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
there's actually more risk of
 
04:41:17.708 --> 04:41:17.718 align:start position:0%
contamination with outdoor cultivation
 
04:41:19.788 --> 04:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons I'm personally
 
04:41:22.070 --> 04:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
so concerned about Main's medical
 
04:41:23.868 --> 04:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
cannabis program where there are
 
04:41:26.948 --> 04:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
hundreds of caregivers growing outdoor
 
04:41:30.310 --> 04:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis and selling it in caregiver
 
04:41:33.230 --> 04:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
storefronts uh with no lab testing
 
04:41:36.310 --> 04:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
requirement and the price is very
 
04:41:38.628 --> 04:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
appealing to patients and patients
 
04:41:40.310 --> 04:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
particularly New Hampshire patients may
 
04:41:41.948 --> 04:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
not have any idea that those products
 
04:41:45.070 --> 04:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
are not lab tested so in our case we'd
 
04:41:46.510 --> 04:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
be testing the flour that we grew
 
04:41:48.590 --> 04:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
outdoors and then we'd be making
 
04:41:51.310 --> 04:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
products out of that flour and then we
 
04:41:53.628 --> 04:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
would have to have those products tested
 
04:41:55.510 --> 04:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
as well so it would be a controlled
 
04:41:57.230 --> 04:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
product it would have to be controlled
 
04:42:00.628 --> 04:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:04.070 --> 04:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
testing so building on that is that one
 
04:42:05.788 --> 04:42:05.798 align:start position:0%
of the reason reasons why there's I I
 
04:42:07.430 --> 04:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of reasons for cost
 
04:42:10.830 --> 04:42:10.840 align:start position:0%
difference but is that one of them that
 
04:42:13.190 --> 04:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
the level of um oversight that we have
 
04:42:14.750 --> 04:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
here in terms of the final product
 
04:42:16.190 --> 04:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
versus there does that dramatically
 
04:42:19.708 --> 04:42:19.718 align:start position:0%
increase cost it significantly increased
 
04:42:22.750 --> 04:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
costs that is one area of cost increase
 
04:42:25.150 --> 04:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
that I have never complained about
 
04:42:28.708 --> 04:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
because obvious reasons uh patients or
 
04:42:31.350 --> 04:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
even adult consumers uh you know we've
 
04:42:33.430 --> 04:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
heard a lot recently about cannabis
 
04:42:36.350 --> 04:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
being uh adulterated with fentanyl for
 
04:42:39.430 --> 04:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
example I'm I I think there have been
 
04:42:41.628 --> 04:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
very few confirmed cases of that
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
actually happening uh but what I've been
 
04:42:47.270 --> 04:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
saying for 17 years as an advocate for
 
04:42:49.470 --> 04:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
responsible regulation of cannabis is
 
04:42:51.070 --> 04:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
that there's a tremendous amount of
 
04:42:53.510 --> 04:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis on the illicit Market that is
 
04:42:57.310 --> 04:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
Tainted with mold and pesticides and
 
04:43:01.470 --> 04:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
fungicides and heavy metals uh the
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
Cannabis that we produce within the
 
04:43:05.350 --> 04:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program does not
 
04:43:09.110 --> 04:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
have those contaminants and that would
 
04:43:10.670 --> 04:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
be the only concern introduced by
 
04:43:13.150 --> 04:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
outdoor or Greenhouse cultivation but we
 
04:43:15.070 --> 04:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
have a testing system that would prevent
 
04:43:17.270 --> 04:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
that from negatively impacting
 
04:43:19.190 --> 04:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
patients um thank you and before I
 
04:43:22.030 --> 04:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Missour um I
 
04:43:23.830 --> 04:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
did want to recognize that having any
 
04:43:25.750 --> 04:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
sort of field trip of the committee is
 
04:43:27.110 --> 04:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
going to run into all sorts of
 
04:43:29.190 --> 04:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
challenges so anybody who wants to learn
 
04:43:31.990 --> 04:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
about it I suggest reach out to Mr Simon
 
04:43:34.510 --> 04:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
um but this won't be any sort of uh
 
04:43:36.990 --> 04:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
mileage approved sort of official
 
04:43:39.550 --> 04:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
tours so representative
 
04:43:42.030 --> 04:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
Missour thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:43:45.190 --> 04:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you um mentioned
 
04:43:45.200 --> 04:43:46.150 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you um mentioned
law

04:43:46.150 --> 04:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:43:48.310 --> 04:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement have they come out in
 
04:43:50.510 --> 04:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
support or opposition of this has there
 
04:43:53.510 --> 04:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
been any discussions maybe there here is
 
04:43:55.310 --> 04:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
someone here to testify today I don't
 
04:43:58.788 --> 04:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
know um but I'd be curious to see what
 
04:44:00.310 --> 04:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
their stance would be on it yeah thank
 
04:44:01.910 --> 04:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
you for the question I have not spoken
 
04:44:03.788 --> 04:44:03.798 align:start position:0%
to the chiefs of Police Association I
 
04:44:07.070 --> 04:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
don't see them here today
 
04:44:09.310 --> 04:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
so thank you any other questions from
 
04:44:12.390 --> 04:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
the committee um and I will ask one I I
 
04:44:13.788 --> 04:44:13.798 align:start position:0%
do know that the largest complaint has
 
04:44:15.590 --> 04:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
been the cost and that some oncologists
 
04:44:17.070 --> 04:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
in the state in the past have just
 
04:44:19.030 --> 04:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
suggested that their patients seek out
 
04:44:21.230 --> 04:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
their grandchildren to reached that
 
04:44:23.628 --> 04:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
market but I think that was in the early
 
04:44:26.510 --> 04:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
days um but the cost is is still
 
04:44:28.868 --> 04:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
significant um will this allow an
 
04:44:30.868 --> 04:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
increased scale that then will allow you
 
04:44:32.708 --> 04:44:32.718 align:start position:0%
to bring down prices to a point where
 
04:44:34.628 --> 04:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
more patients do access it and and sort
 
04:44:38.230 --> 04:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
of have a have a more Market stabilizing
 
04:44:41.708 --> 04:44:41.718 align:start position:0%
function by allowing more canopy
 
04:44:44.190 --> 04:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
space I believe so I there are a number
 
04:44:47.190 --> 04:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
of factors that that impact cost uh but
 
04:44:49.150 --> 04:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
this is certainly one of them it would
 
04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
enable us to cultivate more cheaply and
 
04:44:53.150 --> 04:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
to pass that savings
 
04:44:56.830 --> 04:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
along thank you um and with that I will
 
04:44:58.990 --> 04:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
call oh sorry I representative Merchant
 
04:45:02.310 --> 04:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you madam chair and
 
04:45:04.830 --> 04:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the quick question
 
04:45:07.070 --> 04:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the bill at this point in
 
04:45:11.070 --> 04:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
time on line seven about compliance with
 
04:45:13.628 --> 04:45:13.638 align:start position:0%
local zoning laws then it goes on and
 
04:45:15.390 --> 04:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
says they Department shall in
 
04:45:16.788 --> 04:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
conjunction with local governing body
 
04:45:19.510 --> 04:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
and so forth consult with
 
04:45:23.310 --> 04:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
them are we saying that the local zoning
 
04:45:26.830 --> 04:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
law if they decide not to allow for This
 
04:45:30.110 --> 04:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
Will trump the department or is it just
 
04:45:31.590 --> 04:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
one of those things where it's a
 
04:45:33.628 --> 04:45:33.638 align:start position:0%
courtesy from the Department to talk to
 
04:45:35.990 --> 04:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
local people But ultimately they can do
 
04:45:38.390 --> 04:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:41.070 --> 04:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
wish okay thank you for the question I
 
04:45:44.430 --> 04:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
think it it may be two questions uh we
 
04:45:46.350 --> 04:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
would have to comply with local zoning
 
04:45:48.830 --> 04:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
laws I don't think there's any ambiguity
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
there uh and the department separately
 
04:45:56.708 --> 04:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
shall uh solicit input from patients
 
04:45:58.590 --> 04:45:58.600 align:start position:0%
caregivers and residents of the town and
 
04:45:59.830 --> 04:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
that goes back to what representative
 
04:46:02.310 --> 04:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
mlan was saying when each of the uh
 
04:46:04.470 --> 04:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
dispensaries and production facilities
 
04:46:06.750 --> 04:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
open there had to be a public meeting in
 
04:46:09.708 --> 04:46:09.718 align:start position:0%
that town to discuss concerns it was not
 
04:46:13.270 --> 04:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
an approval process uh but they did have
 
04:46:15.030 --> 04:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
to be consistent with zoning they we
 
04:46:17.990 --> 04:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:21.750 --> 04:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
laws thank you in regards to the zoning
 
04:46:24.190 --> 04:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
laws help with with the
 
04:46:26.310 --> 04:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
clarification what happens if the town
 
04:46:30.110 --> 04:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
laws I don't
 
04:46:33.200 --> 04:46:37.310 align:start position:0%
laws I don't
know

04:46:37.310 --> 04:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:38.830 --> 04:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
04:46:41.110 --> 04:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
04:46:49.510 --> 04:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:51.708 --> 04:46:51.718 align:start position:0%
Riddle I've been a little LAX on this
 
04:46:53.270 --> 04:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make sure that I do in fact
 
04:46:54.788 --> 04:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
make it Ding and let you know if you've
 
04:46:57.590 --> 04:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
gone too far past so just for everybody
 
04:46:59.910 --> 04:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
in general not for you specifically okay
 
04:47:01.548 --> 04:47:01.558 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am I was worried that you
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
were singling me out do I have a reput
 
04:47:06.868 --> 04:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
not at all I just want to make sure that
 
04:47:08.470 --> 04:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not letting things sort of extend
 
04:47:11.070 --> 04:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
for everybody before I start how long
 
04:47:12.750 --> 04:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
are you setting up for three minutes oh
 
04:47:13.910 --> 04:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay so less than you've actually
 
04:47:15.868 --> 04:47:15.878 align:start position:0%
requested which is a good reason to ask
 
04:47:18.030 --> 04:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
to remind you okay thank you madam chair
 
04:47:20.150 --> 04:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Jim

Riddle and Hillsboro I mentioned before
 
04:47:25.190 --> 04:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
some of you weren't in the room yet I do
 
04:47:28.750 --> 04:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
have a uh New Hampshire medical card as
 
04:47:32.830 --> 04:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
well as a USDA hemp grower license I
 
04:47:35.070 --> 04:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
grew up on a farm and been involved in
 
04:47:37.830 --> 04:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
agriculture my whole life and uh
 
04:47:41.150 --> 04:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
specifically in organic production and
 
04:47:45.670 --> 04:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know the way that the um current
 
04:47:48.470 --> 04:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh cannabis medical cannabis is produced
 
04:47:52.310 --> 04:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
as was described by Mr Simon as indoors
 
04:47:55.190 --> 04:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
total artificial environment you know
 
04:47:57.868 --> 04:47:57.878 align:start position:0%
dependent on electricity High inputs of
 
04:48:02.470 --> 04:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
light and uh ventilation Etc and yeah
 
04:48:04.830 --> 04:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
that's producing uh good predictable
 
04:48:07.270 --> 04:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
products but I'm very excited to see
 
04:48:11.030 --> 04:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
this bill before you uh to get some of
 
04:48:13.110 --> 04:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
that production in at least into a
 
04:48:15.628 --> 04:48:15.638 align:start position:0%
greenhouse and I I I would certainly
 
04:48:18.350 --> 04:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
encourage amending uh to add the words
 
04:48:20.510 --> 04:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
or Outdoors to the sentence where the
 
04:48:23.948 --> 04:48:23.958 align:start position:0%
greenhouse is is uh mentioned in in line
 
04:48:28.750 --> 04:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
five um because I think um that provides
 
04:48:31.948 --> 04:48:31.958 align:start position:0%
a totally different product um if you
 
04:48:33.750 --> 04:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
think about the tomatoes you grow in
 
04:48:37.510 --> 04:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
your Garden in the summer the flavor
 
04:48:38.948 --> 04:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
versus the ones you're buying right now
 
04:48:41.670 --> 04:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
in the grocery store they look nice they
 
04:48:43.628 --> 04:48:43.638 align:start position:0%
look like tomatoes but they just don't
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
have flavor but things that are grown in
 
04:48:48.470 --> 04:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
Healthy Living soils I we've had a
 
04:48:50.708 --> 04:48:50.718 align:start position:0%
saying in the organic world forever that
 
04:48:53.910 --> 04:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
healthy soil leads to healthy plants
 
04:48:55.590 --> 04:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
healthy animals healthy people and a
 
04:48:58.230 --> 04:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
healthy Planet it's all about soil
 
04:49:00.830 --> 04:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
health and you can extract the chemicals
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
and give that plant what it needs to
 
04:49:06.070 --> 04:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
produce the cannaboids and good flour
 
04:49:09.070 --> 04:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
Etc but there's nothing like that the
 
04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
Ecology of soil the organisms that
 
04:49:15.390 --> 04:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
release nutrients to the plants lead to
 
04:49:18.868 --> 04:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
much more complex phytochemicals in that
 
04:49:22.070 --> 04:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
plant and with cannabis medicine it's
 
04:49:25.470 --> 04:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
not just the cannaboids it's not just
 
04:49:27.590 --> 04:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
the THC level that everybody's focusing
 
04:49:30.708 --> 04:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
on potency it's also the Turpin these
 
04:49:34.670 --> 04:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
secondary plant uh phytochemicals that
 
04:49:37.548 --> 04:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
when you you know really uh can be
 
04:49:39.110 --> 04:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
produced under those artificial
 
04:49:42.110 --> 04:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
conditions definitely um but they also
 
04:49:44.990 --> 04:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
can be produced uh with Healthy Living
 
04:49:48.868 --> 04:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
soil and plants that are uh exposed to
 
04:49:51.910 --> 04:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
the sunlight but also to the wind to
 
04:49:55.628 --> 04:49:55.638 align:start position:0%
pests they develop different chemicals
 
04:49:57.868 --> 04:49:57.878 align:start position:0%
depending on the stresses that a plant
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
experiences during its life um so I just
 
04:50:06.070 --> 04:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to endanger the bill by
 
04:50:08.470 --> 04:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
adding or Outdoors if if that would you
 
04:50:10.750 --> 04:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
know make too many red flags go up but
 
04:50:14.470 --> 04:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
in reality that would allow three types
 
04:50:16.548 --> 04:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
of production really the total
 
04:50:19.270 --> 04:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
artificial indoors that we have now the
 
04:50:21.670 --> 04:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
greenhouse which is intermediary and
 
04:50:25.230 --> 04:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
then the outdoors and that will uh um be
 
04:50:29.350 --> 04:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
the most environmentally sound but also
 
04:50:31.430 --> 04:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
produce the broadest range of products
 
04:50:34.708 --> 04:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
to serve the needs of patients thank you
 
04:50:36.390 --> 04:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
04:50:39.070 --> 04:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
the committee representative McAn thank
 
04:50:40.948 --> 04:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
you madam chair so just for
 
04:50:42.470 --> 04:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
informational purposes because I don't
 
04:50:45.030 --> 04:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
know um when you go to buy a nice juicy
 
04:50:47.830 --> 04:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
tomato and you get it from you know the
 
04:50:49.830 --> 04:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
outside it's nice and it's juicy and
 
04:50:51.788 --> 04:50:51.798 align:start position:0%
it's delicious but there's also a lot of
 
04:50:54.110 --> 04:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
variety um one of the things when I go
 
04:50:57.190 --> 04:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
and I buy like a a Tylenol pill I want
 
04:50:58.948 --> 04:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
the Tylenol to be consistent pill to
 
04:51:02.470 --> 04:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
pill to pill so um so there was some
 
04:51:05.510 --> 04:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier that may be questioned
 
04:51:07.310 --> 04:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
that maybe we would be giving up some of
 
04:51:10.030 --> 04:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
that repeatability though if we went to
 
04:51:12.230 --> 04:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
um outdoor growing so how significant
 
04:51:14.670 --> 04:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
would that be yeah well I come back to
 
04:51:17.350 --> 04:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh Matt Simon's response which you know
 
04:51:19.110 --> 04:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's really the business model the
 
04:51:23.470 --> 04:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
choice of the ATC here but uh and yes
 
04:51:25.350 --> 04:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
they want that predictability it has to
 
04:51:27.230 --> 04:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
be on the label they need to meet their
 
04:51:31.350 --> 04:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
quality standards um so what I heard him
 
04:51:33.788 --> 04:51:33.798 align:start position:0%
say is if they could do greenhouse or
 
04:51:36.990 --> 04:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
outdoor that would be to produce plants
 
04:51:39.110 --> 04:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
that then would be used for processed
 
04:51:42.430 --> 04:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
products not so much for the raw flower
 
04:51:45.070 --> 04:51:45.080 align:start position:0%
but if it could meet the quality
 
04:51:47.590 --> 04:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
standards and the predictability in
 
04:51:50.350 --> 04:51:50.360 align:start position:0%
either outdoor or Greenhouse production
 
04:51:52.070 --> 04:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
um there's no reason why they should be
 
04:51:54.150 --> 04:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
prohibited from doing that but if
 
04:51:56.190 --> 04:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
there's any uncertainty about either the
 
04:51:58.750 --> 04:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
cannaboid levels or the turpine levels
 
04:52:01.430 --> 04:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
then that can be formulated by um
 
04:52:03.310 --> 04:52:03.320 align:start position:0%
breaking down that product and and
 
04:52:05.030 --> 04:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
putting it into an edible where it's
 
04:52:07.430 --> 04:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
gone through a lab testing and it's the
 
04:52:11.190 --> 04:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
controlled um representative
 
04:52:16.110 --> 04:52:16.120 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you madam
 
04:52:18.270 --> 04:52:18.280 align:start position:0%
chair and also I want to follow up on
 
04:52:19.708 --> 04:52:19.718 align:start position:0%
the comment about
 
04:52:22.190 --> 04:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
consistency if the final product
 
04:52:23.910 --> 04:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of where it starts but where
 
04:52:26.788 --> 04:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
it ends up we're going through the
 
04:52:30.310 --> 04:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
analysis to show and demonstrate through
 
04:52:32.750 --> 04:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
the lab analysis that the product is
 
04:52:34.708 --> 04:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
basically the same regardless of its
 
04:52:36.430 --> 04:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
source is that not kind of the
 
04:52:38.910 --> 04:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
gatekeeper is that it's the stamp of
 
04:52:41.670 --> 04:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
approval saying this product is the same
 
04:52:43.150 --> 04:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
as that product because we gone through
 
04:52:44.708 --> 04:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
the lab
 
04:52:46.548 --> 04:52:46.558 align:start position:0%
analysis yeah thank you for your
 
04:52:49.030 --> 04:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
question I I I think any product that's
 
04:52:52.270 --> 04:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
put on the uh Market needs to meet all
 
04:52:55.190 --> 04:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
the basic minimums for you know safety
 
04:52:57.310 --> 04:52:57.320 align:start position:0%
as well as predictability that if it
 
04:53:00.070 --> 04:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
says it has a certain cannaboid content
 
04:53:02.230 --> 04:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
it needs to have that but there are
 
04:53:05.230 --> 04:53:05.240 align:start position:0%
people uh in the marketplace uh looking
 
04:53:09.190 --> 04:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
for outdoor Gran and uh I mentioned that
 
04:53:11.708 --> 04:53:11.718 align:start position:0%
I've been involved in the organic I was
 
04:53:13.788 --> 04:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
an organic inspector for 20 years and
 
04:53:15.150 --> 04:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
and served on the national organic
 
04:53:17.750 --> 04:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
Standards Board and the
 
04:53:23.190 --> 04:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
regulatory because cannabis is federally
 
04:53:25.910 --> 04:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
prohibited and because the word organic
 
04:53:29.628 --> 04:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
is federally regulated there cannot be
 
04:53:32.470 --> 04:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
certified organic cannabis there can be
 
04:53:34.110 --> 04:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
hemp which
 
04:53:37.310 --> 04:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
is the cousin you know same same species
 
04:53:40.910 --> 04:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
but uh um but yet you see that word
 
04:53:43.788 --> 04:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
organic used all over the place in the
 
04:53:46.548 --> 04:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
Cannabis trade but it's an unregulated
 
04:53:49.910 --> 04:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
claim that's being made I I want to see
 
04:53:52.470 --> 04:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
regulated claims that have meaning but
 
04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
there is a market
 
04:53:57.590 --> 04:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
for and now we're talking more in the
 
04:54:00.150 --> 04:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
adult youth recreational side but people
 
04:54:02.030 --> 04:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
are looking for outdoor grown they're
 
04:54:04.590 --> 04:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
looking for specific strain specific
 
04:54:09.990 --> 04:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:12.470 --> 04:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
label um question representative
 
04:54:15.510 --> 04:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you madam chair thanks for
 
04:54:17.750 --> 04:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
taking oh sorry thanks for taking my
 
04:54:20.510 --> 04:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
question um we're about to hear another
 
04:54:22.548 --> 04:54:22.558 align:start position:0%
bill that has to do with homegrown
 
04:54:22.558 --> 04:54:24.548 align:start position:0%
bill that has to do with homegrown
functionally

04:54:24.548 --> 04:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
functionally
 
04:54:28.590 --> 04:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
um I mean this is cost and access are
 
04:54:31.628 --> 04:54:31.638 align:start position:0%
huge issues we've already talked about
 
04:54:34.788 --> 04:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
today um what I'm looking at is you're
 
04:54:37.350 --> 04:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
going to be um Limited in terms of
 
04:54:39.310 --> 04:54:39.320 align:start position:0%
dispensaries in terms of having to grow
 
04:54:41.150 --> 04:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
indoors where they can grow It Outdoors
 
04:54:43.390 --> 04:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem to be fair is some of
 
04:54:46.868 --> 04:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
this creating some sense of fairness um
 
04:54:49.750 --> 04:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
any quality of product
 
04:54:52.030 --> 04:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
because yeah thank you for your question
 
04:54:53.750 --> 04:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
and yeah I have to agree with where
 
04:54:58.948 --> 04:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
you're going with that is uh if uh uh
 
04:55:02.830 --> 04:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
there is the uh outdoor grow option uh
 
04:55:06.590 --> 04:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
for patients to grow a few plants uh
 
04:55:10.110 --> 04:55:10.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully that will be allowed to be up
 
04:55:12.708 --> 04:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
to their choice not be micromanaged by
 
04:55:15.150 --> 04:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
the state of whether it has to be in a
 
04:55:18.750 --> 04:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
closet in a grow tent or it could be uh
 
04:55:21.070 --> 04:55:21.080 align:start position:0%
Outdoors so long as it's secure and
 
04:55:24.350 --> 04:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
meets whatever rules accompany it um but
 
04:55:27.628 --> 04:55:27.638 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the atc's who have invested
 
04:55:29.948 --> 04:55:29.958 align:start position:0%
who've carried this Market made it what
 
04:55:32.948 --> 04:55:32.958 align:start position:0%
it is um should be able to play on the
 
04:55:35.390 --> 04:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
same level playing field that the uh
 
04:55:38.110 --> 04:55:38.120 align:start position:0%
patients hopefully will be able to when
 
04:55:40.070 --> 04:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
the next bill is
 
04:55:43.350 --> 04:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
passed thank you any other questions um
 
04:55:44.830 --> 04:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much for your
 
04:55:47.110 --> 04:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
testimony um next I'd like to call Dr
 
04:55:47.120 --> 04:55:56.430 align:start position:0%
testimony um next I'd like to call Dr
Riley

04:55:56.430 --> 04:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:58.708 --> 04:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
Kirk thank you madam chair and the rest
 
04:56:01.110 --> 04:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh my name is Dr Riley
 
04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
Kirk I have a PhD in Pharmaceutical
 
04:56:05.310 --> 04:56:05.320 align:start position:0%
Sciences specializing in the chemistry
 
04:56:08.110 --> 04:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
and pharmacology of the cannabis plant I
 
04:56:09.868 --> 04:56:09.878 align:start position:0%
want to highlight a fact that Jim Riddle
 
04:56:12.150 --> 04:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
just made earlier about greenhouse and
 
04:56:15.230 --> 04:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
outdoor cultivation practices enhancing
 
04:56:18.030 --> 04:56:18.040 align:start position:0%
the flavor of the flow flavor is a
 
04:56:19.910 --> 04:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
result of tpin and other smelly
 
04:56:22.150 --> 04:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
molecules present in this plant in
 
04:56:24.190 --> 04:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
indoor cultivation the plant has less of
 
04:56:26.230 --> 04:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
a need to produce these smelly molecules
 
04:56:28.190 --> 04:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
because the purpose of producing these
 
04:56:30.510 --> 04:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
molecules for the plant is to protect
 
04:56:33.510 --> 04:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
itself from sunlight microbes and other
 
04:56:35.590 --> 04:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
environmental stressors without these
 
04:56:37.590 --> 04:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
stressors there's no need for the plant
 
04:56:40.110 --> 04:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
to produce them so it produces less we
 
04:56:41.868 --> 04:56:41.878 align:start position:0%
have peer-reviewed scientific studies
 
04:56:43.430 --> 04:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
that greenhouse and outdoor grown
 
04:56:45.868 --> 04:56:45.878 align:start position:0%
cannabis produce unique therapeutically
 
04:56:47.948 --> 04:56:47.958 align:start position:0%
relevant compounds compared to strictly
 
04:56:50.350 --> 04:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
indoor cultivation including a
 
04:56:52.150 --> 04:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
significant increase in tpin and
 
04:56:55.270 --> 04:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
cannaboids and actually less degraded
 
04:56:58.548 --> 04:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
molecules compared to indoor grow indoor
 
04:57:00.830 --> 04:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
cultivation Greenhouse cultivation and
 
04:57:03.590 --> 04:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
outdoor cultivation can all be used as
 
04:57:06.070 --> 04:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
tools to provide the greatest divers
 
04:57:08.190 --> 04:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
diversity and medically relevant
 
04:57:11.470 --> 04:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
compounds from this bioactive plant I
 
04:57:13.390 --> 04:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
understand the need for consistency in
 
04:57:15.910 --> 04:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis products but the efficacy of
 
04:57:17.830 --> 04:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
outdoor and Greenhouse grown cannabis is
 
04:57:20.590 --> 04:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
an undeniable um effect especially for
 
04:57:21.750 --> 04:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
our medical
 
04:57:24.390 --> 04:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
patients Greenhouse cultivation also
 
04:57:26.750 --> 04:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
makes the growing process of greenhouse
 
04:57:28.990 --> 04:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
more oh sorry cultivation makes the
 
04:57:30.948 --> 04:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
growing process of cannabis more green
 
04:57:32.910 --> 04:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
AKA more eco-friendly as mentioned
 
04:57:34.830 --> 04:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
earlier earlier meaning it limits the
 
04:57:36.430 --> 04:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
amount of artificial lighting and the
 
04:57:38.470 --> 04:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
associated light bills and heat costs of
 
04:57:41.628 --> 04:57:41.638 align:start position:0%
those cultivation practices it is also
 
04:57:43.390 --> 04:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
going to allow for faster and more
 
04:57:46.270 --> 04:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
robust cultivation to AC accommodate our
 
04:57:48.590 --> 04:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
potentially upcoming adult use industry
 
04:57:50.390 --> 04:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
in the state which will hopefully allow
 
04:57:52.990 --> 04:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
us to meet the demand and keep the cost
 
04:57:55.830 --> 04:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
of the products as low as possible as
 
04:57:57.910 --> 04:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
far as the smell of cannabis I will
 
04:58:00.510 --> 04:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
remind everyone that manure from farms
 
04:58:02.750 --> 04:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
smells pretty strongly and some old
 
04:58:05.470 --> 04:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
paper smells also smells pretty strongly
 
04:58:07.350 --> 04:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
but we did not stop these industries
 
04:58:10.150 --> 04:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
because of smell
 
04:58:12.390 --> 04:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
alone there are also some smell
 
04:58:14.430 --> 04:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
remediation technologies that could be
 
04:58:16.110 --> 04:58:16.120 align:start position:0%
implemented to reduce the smell of
 
04:58:18.990 --> 04:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
greenh houses as Matt and as Matt Simon
 
04:58:21.270 --> 04:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier um these green houses
 
04:58:22.788 --> 04:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
are not going to be put in the middle of
 
04:58:24.948 --> 04:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
dog parks or next to the mall they're
 
04:58:27.590 --> 04:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
often very far off the beaten path and
 
04:58:28.990 --> 04:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
hard to find if you don't know what
 
04:58:31.590 --> 04:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
you're looking for I also understand the
 
04:58:33.110 --> 04:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
argument that some people don't want to
 
04:58:34.948 --> 04:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
see a greenhouse but alternatively I
 
04:58:36.628 --> 04:58:36.638 align:start position:0%
would say that myself and many other
 
04:58:38.030 --> 04:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
people in the state would love to see
 
04:58:40.110 --> 04:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
more Greenhouse uh cultivation
 
04:58:42.230 --> 04:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
cultivating cannabis we should not feel
 
04:58:43.590 --> 04:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
the need to hide in secretive
 
04:58:45.628 --> 04:58:45.638 align:start position:0%
non-descript buildings as this portrays
 
04:58:47.628 --> 04:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
our industry in the wrong light and this
 
04:58:49.150 --> 04:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
is exactly what our industry has been
 
04:58:51.470 --> 04:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
forced to do for decades one of the
 
04:58:53.270 --> 04:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
benefits of an expanding legal industry
 
04:58:55.030 --> 04:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is we can be proud of
 
04:58:57.230 --> 04:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
it and showcase the amazing cultivators
 
04:58:58.830 --> 04:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
in our state and the flowers that they
 
04:59:01.310 --> 04:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
cultivate to heal our citizens thank you
 
04:59:04.030 --> 04:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions
 
04:59:06.548 --> 04:59:06.558 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Nagel thank you
 
04:59:08.110 --> 04:59:08.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair thanks for taking my
 
04:59:10.270 --> 04:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
question you said something that really
 
04:59:12.510 --> 04:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
struck me you said the undeniable
 
04:59:14.990 --> 04:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
efficacy of homegrown do you have any
 
04:59:16.670 --> 04:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
data to support that because I've never
 
04:59:18.788 --> 04:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
heard that of outdoor gr of outdoor
 
04:59:20.708 --> 04:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
grown of outdoor I would refer back to
 
04:59:22.670 --> 04:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
the paper that I'm happy to send you
 
04:59:24.868 --> 04:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
from the University of Colorado that was
 
04:59:26.670 --> 04:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
comparing indoor vers outdoor versus
 
04:59:28.788 --> 04:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
Greenhouse showing that there is
 
04:59:30.470 --> 04:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
substantially higher amounts of these
 
04:59:32.708 --> 04:59:32.718 align:start position:0%
bioactive compounds produced in outdoor
 
04:59:34.590 --> 04:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
in Greenhouse cultivation compared to
 
04:59:37.708 --> 04:59:37.718 align:start position:0%
indoor and to me that's synonymous with
 
04:59:39.470 --> 04:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
efficacy because you have more of the
 
04:59:41.430 --> 04:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
medicinal compounds present in those
 
04:59:43.708 --> 04:59:43.718 align:start position:0%
flowers and unique compounds as
 
04:59:46.190 --> 04:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
04:59:48.750 --> 04:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
one other questions or did you have a
 
04:59:50.510 --> 04:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
follow up to that well isn't a followup
 
04:59:52.270 --> 04:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
as a separate question yes another
 
04:59:54.430 --> 04:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
question so one of the things I was
 
04:59:57.708 --> 04:59:57.718 align:start position:0%
struck on my tour is that the um the
 
04:59:59.948 --> 04:59:59.958 align:start position:0%
place smelled like grapefruit which is
 
05:00:03.590 --> 05:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
what the tpin smell like um that's not
 
05:00:05.948 --> 05:00:05.958 align:start position:0%
an obnoxious smell it's not till you
 
05:00:08.830 --> 05:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
burn the actual product that you get the
 
05:00:11.270 --> 05:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
obnoxious smell and that can be
 
05:00:14.110 --> 05:00:14.120 align:start position:0%
controlled am I correct absolutely yeah
 
05:00:15.628 --> 05:00:15.638 align:start position:0%
and I agree I think that grapefruit
 
05:00:18.110 --> 05:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
smell is amazing and people I mean these
 
05:00:19.868 --> 05:00:19.878 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities aren't you know
 
05:00:21.990 --> 05:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
burning a bunch of cannabis and that's
 
05:00:24.270 --> 05:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
you know causing the whole area to smell
 
05:00:25.788 --> 05:00:25.798 align:start position:0%
it's they're just cultivating plants
 
05:00:27.990 --> 05:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
that are producing relatively low levels
 
05:00:30.590 --> 05:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
of these organic compounds called tpin
 
05:00:33.070 --> 05:00:33.080 align:start position:0%
which are also present in every single
 
05:00:36.030 --> 05:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
other plant that exists in the
 
05:00:38.190 --> 05:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
world representative
 
05:00:40.868 --> 05:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you madam chair thank you
 
05:00:43.190 --> 05:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
for thanking my question when we're
 
05:00:45.910 --> 05:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
talking about the clinical efficacy of
 
05:00:45.920 --> 05:00:46.948 align:start position:0%
talking about the clinical efficacy of
the

05:00:46.948 --> 05:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:00:49.910 --> 05:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
product out grown Outdoors versus grown
 
05:00:51.310 --> 05:00:51.320 align:start position:0%
in Greenhouse so we talking about a
 
05:00:54.310 --> 05:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
product that's consumed orally um in a
 
05:00:56.430 --> 05:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
sense it's edible and it's going through
 
05:00:58.150 --> 05:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
GI track we talking about a product
 
05:01:00.470 --> 05:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's going through the lungs through
 
05:01:02.030 --> 05:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
something that's inhaled because they're
 
05:01:03.830 --> 05:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
fundamentally do different ways to get
 
05:01:05.868 --> 05:01:05.878 align:start position:0%
the drug into the body that's a very
 
05:01:08.030 --> 05:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
good question I'm just really referring
 
05:01:10.590 --> 05:01:10.600 align:start position:0%
to what the plant is producing for those
 
05:01:12.628 --> 05:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
molecules and then I think it would be
 
05:01:15.510 --> 05:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
up to that uh business to decide what to
 
05:01:17.430 --> 05:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
do with it after but it exists in that
 
05:01:20.390 --> 05:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
plant when oftentimes it does not exist
 
05:01:22.150 --> 05:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
in indoor cultivation because those
 
05:01:24.190 --> 05:01:24.200 align:start position:0%
genes are never activated to actually
 
05:01:26.868 --> 05:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
transcribe and produce those molecules
 
05:01:29.708 --> 05:01:29.718 align:start position:0%
so thank you followup question to
 
05:01:31.548 --> 05:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel as
 
05:01:35.310 --> 05:01:35.320 align:start position:0%
well is it's nice to talk about
 
05:01:38.270 --> 05:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
the plant itself and what we find from
 
05:01:40.590 --> 05:01:40.600 align:start position:0%
analyzing the plant can we somehow tie
 
05:01:44.230 --> 05:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
that to some sort of studies evidence
 
05:01:47.990 --> 05:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
that that change in the plant per
 
05:01:50.708 --> 05:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
se causes a change in the efficacy of
 
05:01:53.788 --> 05:01:53.798 align:start position:0%
the product in the body I will bring up
 
05:01:55.270 --> 05:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
an example of the study that I'm
 
05:01:56.948 --> 05:01:56.958 align:start position:0%
referencing that there was an increase
 
05:01:58.868 --> 05:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
in the amount of beta caropine which is
 
05:02:01.190 --> 05:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
a turpine produced by the cannabis plant
 
05:02:03.948 --> 05:02:03.958 align:start position:0%
beta caropine directly to the canab
 
05:02:06.310 --> 05:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
cannaboid 2 receptor in the gut and it
 
05:02:08.070 --> 05:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
has been shown to be efficacious for
 
05:02:09.788 --> 05:02:09.798 align:start position:0%
people with crohn's disease ulcerative
 
05:02:12.510 --> 05:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
colitis and many other gut conditions so
 
05:02:14.708 --> 05:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
in this instance the plants that produce
 
05:02:16.868 --> 05:02:16.878 align:start position:0%
more of this medicinal compound would be
 
05:02:18.670 --> 05:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
more medicinally relevant and often
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
efficacious for this population compared
 
05:02:22.830 --> 05:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
to a plant that was grown indoors that
 
05:02:26.990 --> 05:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:28.948 --> 05:02:28.958 align:start position:0%
molecule thank you uh representative
 
05:02:31.030 --> 05:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
Nagel sorry thank you madam chair I just
 
05:02:32.990 --> 05:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
have a quick if you could send me the
 
05:02:34.548 --> 05:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
the paper from University of Colorado
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
and do you by any chance know who the
 
05:02:38.270 --> 05:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
authors were of that paper not off the
 
05:02:40.270 --> 05:02:40.280 align:start position:0%
top of my you get it for us I'm happy to
 
05:02:42.910 --> 05:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
send it though thank you um thank you
 
05:02:44.350 --> 05:02:44.360 align:start position:0%
actually if you send it to the chair
 
05:02:45.910 --> 05:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
chairman we probably all want to have it
 
05:02:47.270 --> 05:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
so if you send it to the chairman he can
 
05:02:49.190 --> 05:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
distribute it to the committee thank you
 
05:02:50.948 --> 05:02:50.958 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony and your
 
05:02:52.548 --> 05:02:52.558 align:start position:0%
study of this uh
 
05:02:55.430 --> 05:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
subject um next I'll call Dr joannon and
 
05:02:57.270 --> 05:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
he's the last card I have for this um
 
05:02:57.280 --> 05:02:58.390 align:start position:0%
he's the last card I have for this um
this

05:02:58.390 --> 05:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:04.110 --> 05:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you all you start the timer
 
05:03:05.430 --> 05:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
anytime I'm
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
ready um thank you my name is Joe Hannah
 
05:03:10.830 --> 05:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh I've talked to you already several
 
05:03:13.470 --> 05:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
times so I won't be too wordy like I
 
05:03:16.150 --> 05:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
usually am but um you know I was also on
 
05:03:17.910 --> 05:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
the the uh study commission not the
 
05:03:19.788 --> 05:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
recent one but the one that had a quarum
 
05:03:23.270 --> 05:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
and a report years ago um and we we took
 
05:03:25.590 --> 05:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
tours I also took tours uh with people
 
05:03:28.510 --> 05:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
on this committee at a grow facility um
 
05:03:30.230 --> 05:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
I drove past it three times before I
 
05:03:31.590 --> 05:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
could find it I kept turning I'm like
 
05:03:32.830 --> 05:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
where is it where is it I couldn't find
 
05:03:35.230 --> 05:03:35.240 align:start position:0%
the place uh it was very and it was a
 
05:03:37.070 --> 05:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
huge building but it was very easy to
 
05:03:38.910 --> 05:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
miss I didn't even really smell it as I
 
05:03:40.910 --> 05:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
was approaching it in fact the the place
 
05:03:43.150 --> 05:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
that I uh I could say it's safe it's
 
05:03:45.310 --> 05:03:45.320 align:start position:0%
safe to say that I smelled a stronger I
 
05:03:47.470 --> 05:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say overwhelming I was welmed
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh by the smell of cannabis in the back
 
05:03:52.868 --> 05:03:52.878 align:start position:0%
of the the house anti room more than I
 
05:03:54.948 --> 05:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
was walking past any of these grow
 
05:03:56.868 --> 05:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
facilities for some that know history
 
05:03:59.830 --> 05:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
you might know what I'm talking about um
 
05:04:03.628 --> 05:04:03.638 align:start position:0%
but it was in the paper look it up um so
 
05:04:05.070 --> 05:04:05.080 align:start position:0%
anyway the we we've already heard
 
05:04:06.830 --> 05:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
building costs the higher energy costs
 
05:04:08.590 --> 05:04:08.600 align:start position:0%
that we have in New Hampshire that's one
 
05:04:09.868 --> 05:04:09.878 align:start position:0%
reason why things are more anything
 
05:04:11.548 --> 05:04:11.558 align:start position:0%
indoors is more expensive building costs
 
05:04:13.230 --> 05:04:13.240 align:start position:0%
limitations of materials I tried to put
 
05:04:14.990 --> 05:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
in a little renovation in my house I
 
05:04:17.190 --> 05:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't get plywood for two years you
 
05:04:18.788 --> 05:04:18.798 align:start position:0%
know what do you have if you can't you
 
05:04:20.030 --> 05:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
know there's cars in the market that
 
05:04:22.310 --> 05:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
were there without transistors there are
 
05:04:23.750 --> 05:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
I heard Governor sen last night talking
 
05:04:25.750 --> 05:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
about a housing crisis they have uh a
 
05:04:27.830 --> 05:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
building several building projects have
 
05:04:29.150 --> 05:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
been held up because of like a
 
05:04:31.150 --> 05:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
Transformer of some kind they can't get
 
05:04:32.590 --> 05:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
there are very large projects that can't
 
05:04:34.350 --> 05:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
be done because of things in the market
 
05:04:37.868 --> 05:04:37.878 align:start position:0%
it also from my my my uh learning
 
05:04:39.430 --> 05:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
experiences with the different uh
 
05:04:41.708 --> 05:04:41.718 align:start position:0%
Growers and stuff it takes many months
 
05:04:44.670 --> 05:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
maybe up to 9 11 months or more once the
 
05:04:46.670 --> 05:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
once you have a building to actually get
 
05:04:49.708 --> 05:04:49.718 align:start position:0%
a crop and a a ready for market so they
 
05:04:50.910 --> 05:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
don't just say oh we're going to grow
 
05:04:52.110 --> 05:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
have a grow facility and then like you
 
05:04:54.750 --> 05:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
know one sun cycle later they're they're
 
05:04:56.548 --> 05:04:56.558 align:start position:0%
ready you know they can't really do it
 
05:04:58.070 --> 05:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
that fast it takes many months and
 
05:04:59.430 --> 05:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to get these places
 
05:05:01.230 --> 05:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
up and running so if we're going to have
 
05:05:03.470 --> 05:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
an expanded patient population which
 
05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for pushing that um you're
 
05:05:08.750 --> 05:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
going to need expanded supply for the
 
05:05:10.948 --> 05:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
for the patients and this is absolutely
 
05:05:13.070 --> 05:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
necessary uh utility costs we talked
 
05:05:14.190 --> 05:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
about meeting the needs of the patients
 
05:05:16.310 --> 05:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
having by decreased costs but it was
 
05:05:17.548 --> 05:05:17.558 align:start position:0%
also mentioned by someone I'd like to
 
05:05:19.430 --> 05:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
reiterate it's important for the
 
05:05:22.788 --> 05:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
purposes of diversity of product uh you
 
05:05:24.270 --> 05:05:24.280 align:start position:0%
know you're going to see if you only can
 
05:05:26.750 --> 05:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
have so much and you can only grow one
 
05:05:29.230 --> 05:05:29.240 align:start position:0%
you know one area or one crop you're not
 
05:05:30.788 --> 05:05:30.798 align:start position:0%
going to have as much diversity and
 
05:05:32.470 --> 05:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
people really have different needs for
 
05:05:34.030 --> 05:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
for for medical products not just in
 
05:05:37.670 --> 05:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis but anything um you know I I I
 
05:05:38.830 --> 05:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
guess we if we pulled everyone here
 
05:05:39.948 --> 05:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
what's your favorite soft drink there
 
05:05:43.270 --> 05:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
would be many different you know options
 
05:05:44.390 --> 05:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh it's the same with cannabis people
 
05:05:45.868 --> 05:05:45.878 align:start position:0%
have different flavors different choices
 
05:05:47.030 --> 05:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
and there's different things we heard
 
05:05:48.430 --> 05:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
about uh medicinal properties that
 
05:05:49.750 --> 05:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to have increased benefits
 
05:05:51.030 --> 05:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
from from growing
 
05:05:54.590 --> 05:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
Outdoors um you know and lastly i' I'd
 
05:05:57.190 --> 05:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
like to say that um you know having one
 
05:05:58.948 --> 05:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
grow facility is really having a
 
05:06:00.868 --> 05:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
business with all of their eggs in one
 
05:06:02.070 --> 05:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
basket if something happens to that
 
05:06:03.910 --> 05:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
place if a roof collapse from snow if
 
05:06:06.350 --> 05:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
there's a power outage or a Transformer
 
05:06:08.190 --> 05:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
gets hit that place is out of commission
 
05:06:11.030 --> 05:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
it could ruin AC Copic or delay it um
 
05:06:12.590 --> 05:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
that can drastically affect the
 
05:06:14.910 --> 05:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
patients's um you know ability to get
 
05:06:16.590 --> 05:06:16.600 align:start position:0%
their what they need it can affect costs
 
05:06:19.030 --> 05:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
and all kinds of things so please pass
 
05:06:21.548 --> 05:06:21.558 align:start position:0%
this this is this one just makes sense
 
05:06:23.830 --> 05:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
um and i' I'd really appreciate if you
 
05:06:25.590 --> 05:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
could also support this to be in line
 
05:06:27.910 --> 05:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
with supporting expanding the uh medical
 
05:06:30.628 --> 05:06:30.638 align:start position:0%
patient population thank you thank you
 
05:06:33.788 --> 05:06:33.798 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
05:06:35.708 --> 05:06:35.718 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh thank you very much and
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
since I don't have any other cards I
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
will close the hearing on House Bill
 
05:06:42.628 --> 05:06:42.638 align:start position:0%
1581 and hand uh the the role of chair
 
05:06:45.628 --> 05:06:45.638 align:start position:0%
back to the chairman of the
 
05:06:49.750 --> 05:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:51.910 --> 05:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
Lon okay I'm going to open the public
 
05:06:54.868 --> 05:06:54.878 align:start position:0%
hearing on host Bill 1231 at this time
 
05:06:56.510 --> 05:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
and recognize the prime sponsor
 
05:06:58.548 --> 05:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas
 
05:06:59.868 --> 05:06:59.878 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas we need to give
 
05:07:02.150 --> 05:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
you a seat at this table I think or at
 
05:07:03.750 --> 05:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
least in this
 
05:07:07.150 --> 05:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
committee it's me again um
 
05:07:08.990 --> 05:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas town of
 
05:07:14.430 --> 05:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
marac I am pleased to present this bill
 
05:07:17.628 --> 05:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
once again to this committee it is the
 
05:07:21.030 --> 05:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
exact same bill as amended that you
 
05:07:24.030 --> 05:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
passed last year 19 to1 from this
 
05:07:26.868 --> 05:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
committee and it passed on the consent
 
05:07:30.990 --> 05:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
calendar it was put on the table in the
 
05:07:33.470 --> 05:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
Senate so I'm here to introduce House
 
05:07:36.350 --> 05:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 2170 which is permitting qualifying
 
05:07:38.788 --> 05:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
patients and designated caregivers to
 
05:07:41.628 --> 05:07:41.638 align:start position:0%
cultivate cannabis for therapetic use
 
05:07:44.470 --> 05:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
most people call this the hom grow bill
 
05:07:46.430 --> 05:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to walk you through this
 
05:07:48.830 --> 05:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
this this argument so why do we need
 
05:07:52.510 --> 05:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
this bill first reason is cost cannabis
 
05:07:55.470 --> 05:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
is not covered by insurance if you are a
 
05:07:57.390 --> 05:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
patient who uses a lot to keep your
 
05:07:59.830 --> 05:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
symptoms under control it can be
 
05:08:01.830 --> 05:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
expensive and remember this is a
 
05:08:04.070 --> 05:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
vulnerable able population many of us
 
05:08:05.830 --> 05:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
are unable to hold
 
05:08:10.030 --> 05:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
jobs this bill helps lowincome immobile
 
05:08:12.670 --> 05:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
or H homebound patients who need
 
05:08:14.990 --> 05:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
medicinal cannabis to able to grow their
 
05:08:18.070 --> 05:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
own medicine and get help help doing
 
05:08:21.390 --> 05:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
so dispensary location there are seven

differently to cannabis strains what may

work right for one person might not be

as effective for another person

sometimes the strain that works best for
 
05:08:49.390 --> 05:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
you might be discontinued growing it
 
05:08:50.788 --> 05:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
would be a good

option the New Hampshire therapeutic
 
05:08:56.150 --> 05:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis program began in 2013 it's 10
 
05:08:59.548 --> 05:08:59.558 align:start position:0%
years old since we began we have learned
 
05:09:01.628 --> 05:09:01.638 align:start position:0%
about the program and patients needs
 
05:09:04.830 --> 05:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
dispens have been added along with more

qualif qualifications to get into the
 
05:09:08.708 --> 05:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
program and the program has been
 
05:09:11.868 --> 05:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
modified to better suit patients needs
 
05:09:14.670 --> 05:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
since 2009 the New Hampshire house has
 
05:09:16.910 --> 05:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
consistently supported bills allowing
 
05:09:18.830 --> 05:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
patients with qualifying medical
 
05:09:20.430 --> 05:09:20.440 align:start position:0%

05:09:31.310 --> 05:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
agreed advancing homegrown legislation
 
05:09:34.230 --> 05:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
went to the governor 's desk both bills
 
05:09:36.190 --> 05:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
were vetoed and the override efforts
 
05:09:39.390 --> 05:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
fell short in the senate in 2020 the
 
05:09:41.070 --> 05:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
Senate passed a homeg grow bill in a

05:09:45.628 --> 05:09:45.638 align:start position:0%
prevented it from being considered in

the
 
05:09:50.788 --> 05:09:50.798 align:start position:0%
house what this bill does this bill
 
05:09:52.310 --> 05:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
allows New Hampshire therapeutic
 
05:09:55.590 --> 05:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis patients or caregivers to grow
 
05:09:57.868 --> 05:09:57.878 align:start position:0%

05:10:04.628 --> 05:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
patients are still Bound by the

guidelines of the program as identified
 
05:10:08.750 --> 05:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
when you submit or renew your

application if grown outside the plants
 
05:10:14.270 --> 05:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
cannot be viewed from another private
 
05:10:16.470 --> 05:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
property it would allow New Hampshire
 
05:10:18.270 --> 05:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients to have
 
05:10:20.948 --> 05:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
and grow Three Mature which are
 
05:10:24.548 --> 05:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
flowering plants three immature or
 
05:10:27.708 --> 05:10:27.718 align:start position:0%
non-flowering plants and 12 seedlings
 
05:10:30.310 --> 05:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
which are identified at 6 in or
 
05:10:33.030 --> 05:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
less patients can grow the plants from
 
05:10:35.070 --> 05:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
seeds and some of the dispensaries have
 
05:10:37.190 --> 05:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
said that they will be able to provide
 
05:10:39.990 --> 05:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
seedlings the plants must be kept in a
 
05:10:41.670 --> 05:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
locked and secured location that is
 
05:10:44.590 --> 05:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
reported to the state the patient must
 
05:10:47.110 --> 05:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
ensure that the plants are secured from
 
05:10:50.750 --> 05:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
unauthorized access patients would have
 
05:10:52.910 --> 05:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
access to State Labs for testing of
 
05:10:55.670 --> 05:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids and possible contamination
 
05:10:57.708 --> 05:10:57.718 align:start position:0%
which is usually mold or
 
05:11:02.470 --> 05:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
mites what this bill does not do this
 
05:11:04.310 --> 05:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
bill does not mean that every
 
05:11:06.788 --> 05:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patient will start
 
05:11:09.590 --> 05:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
growing plants some patients will try
 
05:11:11.548 --> 05:11:11.558 align:start position:0%
and then realize it's too much work and
 
05:11:13.868 --> 05:11:13.878 align:start position:0%
they'll stop some patients will be
 
05:11:15.628 --> 05:11:15.638 align:start position:0%
interested and will simply gather
 
05:11:17.628 --> 05:11:17.638 align:start position:0%
information on how to grow cannabis
 
05:11:20.948 --> 05:11:20.958 align:start position:0%
plants and some patients will simply say
 
05:11:22.390 --> 05:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
I'd rather buy the
 
05:11:26.190 --> 05:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
flower it does not create dealers or
 
05:11:28.470 --> 05:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
suppliers the therapeutic cannabis
 
05:11:29.590 --> 05:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
program is
 
05:11:31.510 --> 05:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
self-regulating to be in this program
 
05:11:33.628 --> 05:11:33.638 align:start position:0%
you must sign a contract that stipulates
 
05:11:35.868 --> 05:11:35.878 align:start position:0%
limitations on how much cannabis we can
 
05:11:38.910 --> 05:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
have where we can keep it and how and
 
05:11:41.510 --> 05:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
where we can use it we know that if we
 
05:11:43.670 --> 05:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
disregard these conditions we can be
 
05:11:45.708 --> 05:11:45.718 align:start position:0%
kicked out of the program or we can be
 
05:11:48.548 --> 05:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
penalized at a higher rate than
 
05:11:52.150 --> 05:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
others no patient is going to risk that
 
05:11:54.350 --> 05:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
again this is not Recreation this is a
 
05:11:58.270 --> 05:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
medical program for very sick patients
 
05:12:01.910 --> 05:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
it does not create hidden stash stat St

state reasons for allowing home
 
05:12:13.070 --> 05:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
cultivation secure home cultivation is
 
05:12:17.030 --> 05:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
not causing any problems 14 of the 18
 
05:12:19.190 --> 05:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
states that have legalized adult use
 
05:12:21.310 --> 05:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis and about half of the medical
 
05:12:23.510 --> 05:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
commun uh cannabis states allow for

reasonable safeguards home cultivation
 
05:12:32.788 --> 05:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
has not been a problem no no state has
 
05:12:34.868 --> 05:12:34.878 align:start position:0%
repealed home
 
05:12:36.910 --> 05:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
cultivation home cultivation is
 
05:12:39.390 --> 05:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
important for patients about 6% of
 
05:12:41.628 --> 05:12:41.638 align:start position:0%
Americans use cannabis for therapeutic
 
05:12:44.590 --> 05:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
reason uh reasons insurance does not
 
05:12:46.948 --> 05:12:46.958 align:start position:0%
cover cannabis for many people with
 
05:12:48.990 --> 05:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
serious medical conditions medical
 
05:12:51.190 --> 05:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
expenses and a reduced ability to work
 
05:12:54.750 --> 05:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
make getting cannabis cannabis Difficult
 
05:12:56.670 --> 05:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
by allowing home cultivation you are
 
05:12:58.190 --> 05:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
giving the therapeutic patients
 
05:13:00.510 --> 05:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
Financial relief for their non-insurance
 
05:13:02.628 --> 05:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
covered medicine
 
05:13:04.990 --> 05:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
home cultivation helps to displace the
 
05:13:08.270 --> 05:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
illicit Market some patients need more
 
05:13:10.150 --> 05:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
some patients don't have the financial
 
05:13:12.510 --> 05:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
means to purchase tested and measured
 
05:13:15.310 --> 05:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis from the dispensaries home
 
05:13:17.548 --> 05:13:17.558 align:start position:0%
cultivation would allow those patients
 
05:13:19.830 --> 05:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
access to cannabis without having to use
 
05:13:22.948 --> 05:13:22.958 align:start position:0%
the illicit Market home cultivation is
 
05:13:24.750 --> 05:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
consistent with our commitment to
 
05:13:27.868 --> 05:13:27.878 align:start position:0%
freedom and equality in a free Society
 
05:13:29.990 --> 05:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
in a state with the motto of Live Free
 
05:13:32.628 --> 05:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
or Die adults should be allowed to grow
 
05:13:34.430 --> 05:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis plants in their homes for
 
05:13:37.390 --> 05:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use what's happening in the
 
05:13:40.350 --> 05:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
other states Connecticut allows up to
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
Three Mature plants and three immature
 
05:13:45.590 --> 05:13:45.600 align:start position:0%

patient so who who supports this bill
 
05:14:12.788 --> 05:14:12.798 align:start position:0%
this is a bipartisan bill that
 
05:14:14.510 --> 05:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
originally came out of the committee
 
05:14:17.350 --> 05:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
with a vote of 19 to1 and it passed in
 
05:14:20.310 --> 05:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
the house in 2023 on the consent
 
05:14:23.708 --> 05:14:23.718 align:start position:0%
calendar the dispensaries support H grow
 
05:14:25.708 --> 05:14:25.718 align:start position:0%
and are ready to roll out classes on how
 
05:14:28.030 --> 05:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
to grow and may even offer some
 
05:14:31.670 --> 05:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
equipment that could be used to grow the
 
05:14:33.868 --> 05:14:33.878 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis board voted
 
05:14:36.510 --> 05:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
unanimously to support this bill it is
 
05:14:38.990 --> 05:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
seen as an economical way to support
 
05:14:42.190 --> 05:14:42.200 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients in summary
 
05:14:44.150 --> 05:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire therapeutic program
 
05:14:46.990 --> 05:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
has been alive and well since 2016 and
 
05:14:49.350 --> 05:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
it is only getting stronger as we listen
 
05:14:53.350 --> 05:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
to patients needs House Bill 2170 is a
 
05:14:55.830 --> 05:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
compassionate Humane bill that also
 
05:14:58.628 --> 05:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
encourages business growth it's time to
 
05:15:00.510 --> 05:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
let patients take more control of their
 
05:15:03.030 --> 05:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
health and wallet by allowing for home
 
05:15:05.390 --> 05:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
growth in the therapeutic
 
05:15:07.788 --> 05:15:07.798 align:start position:0%
program and I'd like to point out that
 
05:15:12.190 --> 05:15:12.200 align:start position:0%
there's two edits to this uh to this
 
05:15:18.708 --> 05:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:22.868 --> 05:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
7 uh page two line seven I'm sorry uh
 
05:15:26.590 --> 05:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
the word with should be within and it's
 
05:15:28.708 --> 05:15:28.718 align:start position:0%
really just a
 
05:15:35.830 --> 05:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:35.840 --> 05:15:37.948 align:start position:0%
 
27

05:15:37.948 --> 05:15:37.958 align:start position:0%
27
 
05:15:42.270 --> 05:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
uh it uh the the OS didn't catch that
 
05:15:44.070 --> 05:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
there was a date change so the date
 
05:15:48.310 --> 05:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
should be change from the year 2023 to
 
05:15:51.030 --> 05:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
2024 so I don't know if that requires an
 
05:15:53.390 --> 05:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
amendment these are really two typos so
 
05:15:56.910 --> 05:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to leave that in in your hands
 
05:15:58.750 --> 05:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to take any questions
 
05:16:00.750 --> 05:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
05:16:02.270 --> 05:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for bringing this
 
05:16:05.070 --> 05:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
bill um I I actually see that it's not
 
05:16:07.030 --> 05:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
bipartisan I had wanted to be a sponsor
 
05:16:09.110 --> 05:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
but I'd be happy to bring forward the
 
05:16:13.190 --> 05:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
amendment um to change those issues um
 
05:16:14.750 --> 05:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
when I said it was bipartisan it passed
 
05:16:16.750 --> 05:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
on the floor oh and it passed in this
 
05:16:19.510 --> 05:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
committee so but I'd be very happy very
 
05:16:21.548 --> 05:16:21.558 align:start position:0%
happy to have you on a an amendment for
 
05:16:23.430 --> 05:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
this okay thank you and then the other
 
05:16:24.830 --> 05:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
part is you had said that the seedlings
 
05:16:27.030 --> 05:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
were up to six inches um but the
 
05:16:30.910 --> 05:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
definition says up to 12 inches oh okay
 
05:16:32.628 --> 05:16:32.638 align:start position:0%
just thank you this was last year's
 
05:16:34.830 --> 05:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
testimony I yeah okay thank you no I I
 
05:16:36.470 --> 05:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the improvements and I I was
 
05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
going to ask the question before I
 
05:16:39.510 --> 05:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
looked it up so I figured I'd inform
 
05:16:40.990 --> 05:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
everybody else so thank you for doing
 
05:16:44.548 --> 05:16:44.558 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative McLean
 
05:16:45.750 --> 05:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:16:47.708 --> 05:16:47.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I remember this
 
05:16:50.510 --> 05:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
bill because it was 19 to1 last year but
 
05:16:53.230 --> 05:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
you said it it died in the Senate do do
 
05:16:55.788 --> 05:16:55.798 align:start position:0%
you know what their objections were and
 
05:16:58.190 --> 05:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
and have you spoken to them and are they
 
05:17:00.430 --> 05:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
okay with it just go around or what's
 
05:17:03.270 --> 05:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
the status I guess is the question I am
 
05:17:04.948 --> 05:17:04.958 align:start position:0%
never going to um take the
 
05:17:07.390 --> 05:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility of speaking for the
 
05:17:07.400 --> 05:17:09.190 align:start position:0%
responsibility of speaking for the
Senate

05:17:09.190 --> 05:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
05:17:13.230 --> 05:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
however um this bill passed this bill
 
05:17:15.628 --> 05:17:15.638 align:start position:0%
was seen as having Merit coming out of
 
05:17:21.670 --> 05:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
committee um and it it was during a time
 
05:17:24.030 --> 05:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
when the governor was indicating that he
 
05:17:26.670 --> 05:17:26.680 align:start position:0%
would not sign any any uh cannabis bills
 
05:17:30.110 --> 05:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
at all um while this bill was being
 
05:17:32.948 --> 05:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
heard and put on the floor the governor
 
05:17:35.110 --> 05:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
said that if you put a cannabis bill on
 
05:17:38.548 --> 05:17:38.558 align:start position:0%
my desk I will sign it but it was too
 
05:17:42.070 --> 05:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
late for this but because they in my
 
05:17:43.830 --> 05:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
estimation because they found there was
 
05:17:45.670 --> 05:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
Merit to this they didn't kill it in the
 
05:17:47.868 --> 05:17:47.878 align:start position:0%
Senate they tabled it which is why you
 
05:17:50.910 --> 05:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
are seeing the exact same wording as you
 
05:17:53.868 --> 05:17:53.878 align:start position:0%
saw last year thank
 
05:17:56.990 --> 05:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
you other uh representative Nagel thank
 
05:17:59.548 --> 05:17:59.558 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
05:18:02.070 --> 05:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
question in full disclosure I was the
 
05:18:07.430 --> 05:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:09.910 --> 05:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
um sometimes it's a good thing to be the
 
05:18:13.350 --> 05:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
19 to1 but anyways I I I've been on I
 
05:18:14.788 --> 05:18:14.798 align:start position:0%
was on the board of one of the
 
05:18:17.670 --> 05:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
dispensaries for I think six years um
 
05:18:19.670 --> 05:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I know way more than I should know
 
05:18:21.590 --> 05:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
about the business aspects of the
 
05:18:24.110 --> 05:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
nonprofit thing I also sent two kids to
 
05:18:26.830 --> 05:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
college in Colorado so I know how bad A
 
05:18:30.670 --> 05:18:30.680 align:start position:0%
system can be my concern is this um and
 
05:18:32.470 --> 05:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
I didn't really ask it very well of the
 
05:18:35.868 --> 05:18:35.878 align:start position:0%
last um um witness from the previous
 
05:18:35.878 --> 05:18:36.830 align:start position:0%
last um um witness from the previous
bill

05:18:36.830 --> 05:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:18:39.030 --> 05:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
but what I'm concerned about is this
 
05:18:42.708 --> 05:18:42.718 align:start position:0%
when we created this law in this state
 
05:18:44.750 --> 05:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
we went to Great Lengths to not make the
 
05:18:47.390 --> 05:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
same mistakes that other states made I'm
 
05:18:49.150 --> 05:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
sorry can you clarify which bill you
 
05:18:50.830 --> 05:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
said when we created when we created the
 
05:18:53.070 --> 05:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
statute that created the the alternative
 
05:18:55.868 --> 05:18:55.878 align:start position:0%
program yeah the program exactly and I
 
05:18:57.750 --> 05:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
was very proud the way that our state
 
05:19:01.830 --> 05:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
did that um my concern is is this these
 
05:19:04.470 --> 05:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
dispensaries as was noted have really
 
05:19:06.070 --> 05:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
you know borne The Lion Share of
 
05:19:09.110 --> 05:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
creating a really responsible program
 
05:19:11.830 --> 05:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
but they they their their profit margins
 
05:19:14.510 --> 05:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
aren't that great and little things can
 
05:19:16.788 --> 05:19:16.798 align:start position:0%
make huge negative differences for them
 
05:19:18.390 --> 05:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
and what I'm concerned about is you're
 
05:19:21.270 --> 05:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
creating competition here that could
 
05:19:23.868 --> 05:19:23.878 align:start position:0%
undermine them financially and I'm just
 
05:19:25.948 --> 05:19:25.958 align:start position:0%
curious what your thoughts are about
 
05:19:29.070 --> 05:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
that that's a great question um the the
 
05:19:32.190 --> 05:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
atcs are behind this um
 
05:19:35.110 --> 05:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
because yes it will people will grow
 
05:19:36.590 --> 05:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
product at home so they're not going to
 
05:19:39.390 --> 05:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
be buying it from the atc's but the atcs
 
05:19:41.350 --> 05:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
will be providing some of them will be
 
05:19:43.548 --> 05:19:43.558 align:start position:0%
providing seedlings they sell those they
 
05:19:45.548 --> 05:19:45.558 align:start position:0%
don't just give those away they're going
 
05:19:48.670 --> 05:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
to U perhaps be providing seeds again
 
05:19:51.270 --> 05:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
you that's something you buy if you're
 
05:19:54.230 --> 05:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
serious about growing at home you need
 
05:19:57.510 --> 05:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
equipment and I talked to um a fellow
 
05:20:02.350 --> 05:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
from Maine who is growing in in his home
 
05:20:04.390 --> 05:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
and we went through the equipment and
 
05:20:08.270 --> 05:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
for him to do a startup uh a 4 foot tent
 
05:20:11.948 --> 05:20:11.958 align:start position:0%
is about ,000 worth of equipment to buy
 
05:20:14.788 --> 05:20:14.798 align:start position:0%
so you know the dispensaries could could
 
05:20:16.548 --> 05:20:16.558 align:start position:0%
sell the equipment I mean that's another
 
05:20:19.230 --> 05:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
whole Avenue this this doesn't shut down
 
05:20:21.070 --> 05:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
business this opens up another whole
 
05:20:23.070 --> 05:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
Avenue of potential business for the
 
05:20:26.470 --> 05:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
atcs plus there's education and we're
 
05:20:28.910 --> 05:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
going to need we're going to need
 
05:20:30.390 --> 05:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
private Consultants that are going to
 
05:20:32.110 --> 05:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
work with people to show them how to
 
05:20:33.788 --> 05:20:33.798 align:start position:0%
grow so that's going to that's going to
 
05:20:35.350 --> 05:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
open up businesses for private
 
05:20:40.270 --> 05:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
Consultants so so I I don't I don't see
 
05:20:44.670 --> 05:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:47.788 --> 05:20:47.798 align:start position:0%
enhancing you going to vote for it now I
 
05:20:49.670 --> 05:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
said you're gonna vote for it
 
05:20:52.750 --> 05:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
now no don't
 
05:20:57.030 --> 05:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:00.030 --> 05:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr
 
05:21:02.470 --> 05:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
chairman thank
 
05:21:05.070 --> 05:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
you what is the thinking behind the
 
05:21:07.750 --> 05:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
Three Mature plants the three immature
 
05:21:10.548 --> 05:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
plants and 12 seedlings what happens to
 
05:21:12.910 --> 05:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
the other nine seedlings when they're
 
05:21:16.110 --> 05:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
ready to be immature plants uh not all
 
05:21:18.510 --> 05:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
seedlings make it to adulthood just that
 
05:21:21.070 --> 05:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
they're not they won't all be viable
 
05:21:22.628 --> 05:21:22.638 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it's kind of sad but not all
 
05:21:25.310 --> 05:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
of them not all of them make it you know
 
05:21:27.948 --> 05:21:27.958 align:start position:0%
be snuffed out or given to somebody else
 
05:21:29.708 --> 05:21:29.718 align:start position:0%
they would have to be snuffed out or you
 
05:21:35.390 --> 05:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:38.150 --> 05:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
humanly other
 
05:21:40.910 --> 05:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
05:21:43.350 --> 05:21:43.360 align:start position:0%

pleasure also signed up to speak is
 
05:21:51.150 --> 05:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
Michael Holt from the Department of
 
05:21:59.948 --> 05:21:59.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:59.958 --> 05:22:04.990 align:start position:0%
 
Services

05:22:04.990 --> 05:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:06.110 --> 05:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:22:07.750 --> 05:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
committee thanks for the opportunity to
 
05:22:09.990 --> 05:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
testify in this bill uh my name is
 
05:22:11.390 --> 05:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
Michael Holt I'm the administrator of
 
05:22:13.030 --> 05:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program within
 
05:22:14.628 --> 05:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
05:22:17.190 --> 05:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
Services um the department doesn't have
 
05:22:18.910 --> 05:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
a position doesn't take a pos position
 
05:22:21.708 --> 05:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
on this bill but it unquestionably will
 
05:22:24.470 --> 05:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
benefit patients uh due to increased
 
05:22:27.910 --> 05:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
access increased strain availability and
 
05:22:31.830 --> 05:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
lower costs the um the express concern
 
05:22:34.350 --> 05:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
about home cultivation generally is
 
05:22:36.590 --> 05:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
about the increased potential for
 
05:22:40.548 --> 05:22:40.558 align:start position:0%
diversion um however this bill has been
 
05:22:42.350 --> 05:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
circulating for years it has been
 
05:22:45.670 --> 05:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
improved every year uh to try to
 
05:22:48.230 --> 05:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
accommodate those concerns this is a
 
05:22:50.150 --> 05:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
modest proposal especially in the terms
 
05:22:52.510 --> 05:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
of the number of plants um and has many
 
05:22:56.070 --> 05:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
many safeguards and guard rails um uh
 
05:22:57.470 --> 05:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas mentioned many of
 
05:22:58.750 --> 05:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
them i' just like to highlight them
 
05:23:00.670 --> 05:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
again in a in a short list so that we
 
05:23:03.350 --> 05:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
can here the um altogether the the the
 
05:23:05.868 --> 05:23:05.878 align:start position:0%
guard rails in place with regard to this
 
05:23:09.150 --> 05:23:09.160 align:start position:0%
legislation it allows a small number of
 
05:23:12.270 --> 05:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
plants either the patient or their
 
05:23:15.990 --> 05:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
caregiver can cultivate but not both if
 
05:23:18.190 --> 05:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
the caregiver cultivates then that
 
05:23:21.110 --> 05:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
caregiver can have only one patient
 
05:23:23.310 --> 05:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
instead of the typical five that they
 
05:23:25.830 --> 05:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
are allowed so there's no business model
 
05:23:28.270 --> 05:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
here the location must be at the
 
05:23:30.270 --> 05:23:30.280 align:start position:0%
person's residence it can't be in a
 
05:23:31.430 --> 05:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
separate location
 
05:23:33.670 --> 05:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
in a warehouse or an industrial space it
 
05:23:36.548 --> 05:23:36.558 align:start position:0%
has to be at their residents the
 
05:23:38.510 --> 05:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
location must be reported to and
 
05:23:40.270 --> 05:23:40.280 align:start position:0%
registered with the
 
05:23:43.070 --> 05:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
Department the location must be out of
 
05:23:45.190 --> 05:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
public view in a locked and enclosed
 
05:23:49.230 --> 05:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
space with a size limitation a landlord
 
05:23:52.390 --> 05:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
can prohibit cultivation on lease
 
05:23:54.990 --> 05:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
property the department is authorized to
 
05:23:57.350 --> 05:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
share the registered location with local
 
05:23:59.990 --> 05:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
and state law enforcement upon receipt
 
05:24:03.990 --> 05:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
of a sworn affid it the atcs are allowed
 
05:24:06.750 --> 05:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
in this uh Bill to provide seeds and
 
05:24:08.470 --> 05:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
seedlings to patients so there is an
 
05:24:12.030 --> 05:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
easy accessible source for
 
05:24:14.548 --> 05:24:14.558 align:start position:0%
this independent testing labs are
 
05:24:16.350 --> 05:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
allowed under this Bill to accept
 
05:24:18.670 --> 05:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
samples from patients and caregivers uh
 
05:24:22.390 --> 05:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
for testing for cannabinoid profile
 
05:24:24.430 --> 05:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
contaminants and the department has the
 
05:24:26.830 --> 05:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
authority under this bill to revoke the
 
05:24:29.868 --> 05:24:29.878 align:start position:0%
cultivation privilege for any person for
 
05:24:33.470 --> 05:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
violation of the law or the rules in
 
05:24:35.670 --> 05:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
addition to all those safeguards in this
 
05:24:38.830 --> 05:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
bill the current law establishes strict
 
05:24:42.910 --> 05:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
severe penalties for any diversion by
 
05:24:45.030 --> 05:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
patients or caregivers to any
 
05:24:45.040 --> 05:24:47.470 align:start position:0%
patients or caregivers to any
unauthorized

05:24:47.470 --> 05:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
unauthorized
 
05:24:50.350 --> 05:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
persons up to seven years in
 
05:24:53.150 --> 05:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
prison and up to
 
05:24:55.590 --> 05:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
$300,000 in
 
05:24:58.628 --> 05:24:58.638 align:start position:0%
fines as representative Thomas said
 
05:24:58.638 --> 05:24:59.670 align:start position:0%
fines as representative Thomas said
there's

05:24:59.670 --> 05:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:25:03.510 --> 05:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
no incentive for a patient in this
 
05:25:07.150 --> 05:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
program to divert their
 
05:25:09.270 --> 05:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis lastly I would say that the
 
05:25:10.628 --> 05:25:10.638 align:start position:0%
department has no problems
 
05:25:13.590 --> 05:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
operationalizing this bill I'm happy to
 
05:25:14.868 --> 05:25:14.878 align:start position:0%
take any
 
05:25:17.788 --> 05:25:17.798 align:start position:0%
questions representative kushman thank
 
05:25:19.990 --> 05:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you uh Mr Hol
 
05:25:24.110 --> 05:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
for being being here um I just wanted to
 
05:25:29.310 --> 05:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
kind of um understand the um ability to
 
05:25:32.030 --> 05:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh disclose the location to law
 
05:25:35.470 --> 05:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement upon a presentation of a
 
05:25:39.030 --> 05:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
sworn affidavit do you can you delve
 
05:25:41.310 --> 05:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
into that a little bit more for me yes
 
05:25:43.590 --> 05:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
this program is a medical program uh the
 
05:25:45.590 --> 05:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
information that the department has with
 
05:25:47.830 --> 05:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
regard to patients and atcs is protected
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
by Hippa um we're not allowed to share
 
05:25:52.750 --> 05:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
any information from our confidential
 
05:25:56.070 --> 05:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
registry uh with external parties um
 
05:25:57.990 --> 05:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
outside of a court order however there's
 
05:26:00.910 --> 05:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
one provision uh that does allow the the
 
05:26:02.190 --> 05:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
the state the therapeutic cannabis
 
05:26:04.750 --> 05:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
program to release limited information
 
05:26:06.910 --> 05:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
to local and state law enforcement not
 
05:26:08.548 --> 05:26:08.558 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement but local and
 
05:26:10.150 --> 05:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
state law enforcement under certain
 
05:26:13.628 --> 05:26:13.638 align:start position:0%
conditions one of those conditions is so
 
05:26:15.990 --> 05:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
that local and state law enforcement can
 
05:26:18.910 --> 05:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
verify that a patient is in fact a
 
05:26:21.708 --> 05:26:21.718 align:start position:0%
patient um if there's a law enforcement
 
05:26:25.070 --> 05:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
encounter um and the patient uh is a the
 
05:26:27.350 --> 05:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
person is claims therapeutic use of
 
05:26:29.990 --> 05:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis local and state law enforcement
 
05:26:31.910 --> 05:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
officers are allowed to contact the
 
05:26:33.670 --> 05:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
program and under those a certain
 
05:26:36.030 --> 05:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances and an intake sheet we are
 
05:26:38.350 --> 05:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to Prov to verify whether or not
 
05:26:41.390 --> 05:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
that patient is in fact a patient or uh
 
05:26:43.150 --> 05:26:43.160 align:start position:0%
whether they're on the registry or
 
05:26:45.670 --> 05:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
not there's the second provision with
 
05:26:47.868 --> 05:26:47.878 align:start position:0%
regard to our release of information is
 
05:26:51.190 --> 05:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
that upon receipt of a sworn affidavit
 
05:26:53.910 --> 05:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh affirming probable cause that
 
05:26:55.788 --> 05:26:55.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis is possessed by a certain
 
05:26:59.070 --> 05:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
person or a certain at a certain
 
05:27:02.030 --> 05:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
location again the department is allowed
 
05:27:05.070 --> 05:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
to confirm whether or not that personal
 
05:27:08.230 --> 05:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
location is a registered patient and the
 
05:27:11.030 --> 05:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
additions in this bill would extend that
 
05:27:13.590 --> 05:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
allowance for us to provide information
 
05:27:15.910 --> 05:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
to local and state law enforcement if
 
05:27:19.190 --> 05:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
that registered location for cultivation
 
05:27:21.628 --> 05:27:21.638 align:start position:0%
is in fact a registered location for
 
05:27:24.390 --> 05:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
cultivation reported to the department
 
05:27:27.150 --> 05:27:27.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions
 
05:27:29.270 --> 05:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
05:27:31.110 --> 05:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
05:27:33.750 --> 05:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
just to be clear my concern always has
 
05:27:37.030 --> 05:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
been reliability of product so if I
 
05:27:38.990 --> 05:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
understand correctly from testimony
 
05:27:41.788 --> 05:27:41.798 align:start position:0%
that's we've heard for the previous bill
 
05:27:44.990 --> 05:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
that if I own um or I have a dispensary
 
05:27:48.430 --> 05:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
I have to submit my product um for
 
05:27:51.350 --> 05:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
reliability of product but if I have my
 
05:27:54.590 --> 05:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
own homegrown thing I can but I don't
 
05:27:57.070 --> 05:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
have to is that correct uh that is
 
05:28:00.470 --> 05:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
correct Uh current currently patients
 
05:28:03.788 --> 05:28:03.798 align:start position:0%
are not allowed under state law to go to
 
05:28:06.948 --> 05:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
the single independent Testing Lab in
 
05:28:10.190 --> 05:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
the state to have product tested uh
 
05:28:12.350 --> 05:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
state law does not allow that lab to
 
05:28:15.708 --> 05:28:15.718 align:start position:0%
accept those samples from any entity
 
05:28:18.070 --> 05:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
except the three licensed atcs in the
 
05:28:20.750 --> 05:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
state under this bill uh that provision
 
05:28:22.788 --> 05:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
would be expanded so that the Testing
 
05:28:25.628 --> 05:28:25.638 align:start position:0%
Laboratories can accept those samples
 
05:28:27.190 --> 05:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
from patients who are interested to know
 
05:28:29.590 --> 05:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
the cannabinoid profile how strong how
 
05:28:31.948 --> 05:28:31.958 align:start position:0%
potent they're uh their products are um
 
05:28:33.830 --> 05:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
and whether or not they have been grown
 
05:28:35.670 --> 05:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh with uh you know with any
 
05:28:37.910 --> 05:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
contaminants in them but you're you're
 
05:28:39.390 --> 05:28:39.400 align:start position:0%
correct to say that there's not a
 
05:28:42.590 --> 05:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
requirement for them to do so um and
 
05:28:44.430 --> 05:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
that would be a I think that would be a
 
05:28:46.110 --> 05:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
difficult provision
 
05:28:46.120 --> 05:28:47.868 align:start position:0%
difficult provision
to

05:28:47.868 --> 05:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:28:51.270 --> 05:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
enforce follow up I I I totally
 
05:28:53.510 --> 05:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
understand that but you
 
05:28:55.830 --> 05:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
know we're talking about a medicinal
 
05:28:58.230 --> 05:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
product not a recreational product and
 
05:29:01.548 --> 05:29:01.558 align:start position:0%
in medicinal products we expect some
 
05:29:03.670 --> 05:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
amount of reproducibility of what the
 
05:29:05.670 --> 05:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
substance is and we are expecting that
 
05:29:07.310 --> 05:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
of the dispensaries but we're not
 
05:29:08.708 --> 05:29:08.718 align:start position:0%
expecting that of the people that are
 
05:29:12.230 --> 05:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
going to grow it at home is that
 
05:29:14.270 --> 05:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
correct so in other words they don't
 
05:29:17.628 --> 05:29:17.638 align:start position:0%
have to test it if they don't want to uh
 
05:29:19.990 --> 05:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's correct so so we don't have the
 
05:29:22.190 --> 05:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
same level of expectations for them that
 
05:29:24.390 --> 05:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
we do of every other pharmaceutical
 
05:29:28.350 --> 05:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:30.510 --> 05:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
country is is that a is that a a
 
05:29:32.470 --> 05:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
question I mean it it I I think you're
 
05:29:34.390 --> 05:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
right functionally it is so I'm I'm just
 
05:29:37.110 --> 05:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
asking my wrong when I say that uh I
 
05:29:38.510 --> 05:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think I don't think you're
 
05:29:41.310 --> 05:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
wrong no okay uh the issue the issue is
 
05:29:43.390 --> 05:29:43.400 align:start position:0%
is related to strain availability the
 
05:29:45.990 --> 05:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
atcs can you know are only dra growing
 
05:29:48.510 --> 05:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
so many strains um the cost certainly
 
05:29:50.830 --> 05:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
which is a you know a huge barrier we as
 
05:29:53.670 --> 05:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
we've heard all day um and the the
 
05:29:57.390 --> 05:29:57.400 align:start position:0%
relative merits of those issues compared
 
05:30:00.310 --> 05:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
to the reproducibility of a uh of a
 
05:30:02.788 --> 05:30:02.798 align:start position:0%
specific strain you know Time After Time
 
05:30:05.430 --> 05:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
After Time is one that that that is a
 
05:30:08.548 --> 05:30:08.558 align:start position:0%
consideration before this committee um
 
05:30:13.270 --> 05:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:16.590 --> 05:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
you I like you too okay uh
 
05:30:17.868 --> 05:30:17.878 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and then
 
05:30:20.030 --> 05:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
05:30:21.430 --> 05:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and also thank you for taking
 
05:30:24.190 --> 05:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
my question Mr we've talked a couple of
 
05:30:26.350 --> 05:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
times about the atcs and the profit
 
05:30:28.830 --> 05:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
margins they have are relatively
 
05:30:31.910 --> 05:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
thin can you speak or give me some
 
05:30:34.788 --> 05:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
guidance here how this may impact the
 
05:30:39.230 --> 05:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
atcs themselves are we in one way saying
 
05:30:41.868 --> 05:30:41.878 align:start position:0%
that we're allowing people to homow
 
05:30:44.750 --> 05:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
because it's a cost effective which I
 
05:30:48.110 --> 05:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
understand can you speak to at least the
 
05:30:49.868 --> 05:30:49.878 align:start position:0%
possible impact it's going to have on
 
05:30:51.990 --> 05:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
the atcs themselves for the people who
 
05:30:54.590 --> 05:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
decide not to Homegrown or if they don't
 
05:30:56.270 --> 05:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
have atcs does that Force everybody to
 
05:30:57.830 --> 05:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
become a hom
 
05:31:00.670 --> 05:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
grower well that question should would
 
05:31:03.470 --> 05:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
be better directed to representatives of
 
05:31:06.948 --> 05:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
the atcs themselves however I will share
 
05:31:09.910 --> 05:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
that historically starting last year all
 
05:31:10.948 --> 05:31:10.958 align:start position:0%
three of the
 
05:31:14.310 --> 05:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
atc's uh were publicly in support of
 
05:31:14.320 --> 05:31:15.030 align:start position:0%
atc's uh were publicly in support of
this

05:31:15.030 --> 05:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:31:20.070 --> 05:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
legislation um secondly it is assumed
 
05:31:23.830 --> 05:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
that most patients don't have extraction
 
05:31:26.510 --> 05:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
Laboratories in their homes and so
 
05:31:28.788 --> 05:31:28.798 align:start position:0%
there's a wide variety of products that
 
05:31:33.430 --> 05:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
the atc's sell cannabis infused products
 
05:31:36.750 --> 05:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
uh that would not be re reproducible um
 
05:31:40.110 --> 05:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
at a home at a home level and so while
 
05:31:44.628 --> 05:31:44.638 align:start position:0%
it may impact the atc's somewhat um it
 
05:31:47.190 --> 05:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
is not expected that every one will grow
 
05:31:49.990 --> 05:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
their own it is not expected that those
 
05:31:53.548 --> 05:31:53.558 align:start position:0%
who do grow their own don't go to the
 
05:31:56.190 --> 05:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
atcs to purchase products that they
 
05:31:57.590 --> 05:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
can't make
 
05:32:01.510 --> 05:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
themselves thank you representative
 
05:32:04.430 --> 05:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:32:06.390 --> 05:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking this
 
05:32:10.390 --> 05:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
question in terms of um individuals who
 
05:32:12.430 --> 05:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
are growing their own plants then having
 
05:32:16.510 --> 05:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
it tested um not knowing anything about
 
05:32:20.310 --> 05:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
this modern agriculture of um cannabis
 
05:32:22.150 --> 05:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
and not knowing anything about
 
05:32:22.160 --> 05:32:24.310 align:start position:0%
and not knowing anything about
testing

05:32:24.310 --> 05:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
testing
 
05:32:26.910 --> 05:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
um given that these are a limited number
 
05:32:29.510 --> 05:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
of plants which I assume would be
 
05:32:33.548 --> 05:32:33.558 align:start position:0%
somewhat limited amount of cannabis or
 
05:32:35.310 --> 05:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
product as it's called I don't really
 
05:32:37.750 --> 05:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
like using that sort of product but um
 
05:32:40.548 --> 05:32:40.558 align:start position:0%
that it would be a a limited amount of
 
05:32:43.390 --> 05:32:43.400 align:start position:0%
product um is the amount needed for
 
05:32:45.510 --> 05:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
testing would that de incentivize
 
05:32:48.110 --> 05:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
testing would it be a significant amount
 
05:32:50.670 --> 05:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
that you had to give to a
 
05:32:53.310 --> 05:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
lab no okay it's a very small amount
 
05:32:55.708 --> 05:32:55.718 align:start position:0%
that the lab requires to uh attach the
 
05:32:58.510 --> 05:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
potency so that you know there' probably
 
05:33:00.830 --> 05:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
be some cost but it wouldn't the amount
 
05:33:03.788 --> 05:33:03.798 align:start position:0%
that you were having to not use but give
 
05:33:07.390 --> 05:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
to a lab wouldn't be a a the the sample
 
05:33:10.190 --> 05:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
size required by a laboratory to test
 
05:33:12.750 --> 05:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
for potency and contaminants would not
 
05:33:17.270 --> 05:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
serve should not serve as a a barrier if
 
05:33:19.910 --> 05:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
someone was interested in um in having
 
05:33:22.868 --> 05:33:22.878 align:start position:0%
their product tested thank you I say a
 
05:33:24.230 --> 05:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
hand up here representative McLean did
 
05:33:26.868 --> 05:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up earlier no okay
 
05:33:26.878 --> 05:33:28.350 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up earlier no okay
anyone

05:33:28.350 --> 05:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
05:33:36.230 --> 05:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:39.150 --> 05:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is former
 
05:33:48.910 --> 05:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:52.030 --> 05:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
kerk okay sorry and you do have my
 
05:33:53.910 --> 05:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
testimony I distributed it before we
 
05:33:55.670 --> 05:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
started this session so once again for
 
05:33:57.230 --> 05:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
the record Jerry kerk chair of the theer
 
05:33:59.948 --> 05:33:59.958 align:start position:0%
Cannabis medical oversight board um and
 
05:34:02.270 --> 05:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
I'm here to report what TCM o feels
 
05:34:05.270 --> 05:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
about this particular Bill uh TCM does
 
05:34:07.030 --> 05:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
support hb1
 
05:34:09.510 --> 05:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
1231 um we do that because we think it
 
05:34:11.150 --> 05:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
will help our patients and caregivers
 
05:34:13.030 --> 05:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
with affordability accessibility and
 
05:34:14.830 --> 05:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
availability of specific
 
05:34:17.390 --> 05:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
strains excuse me I would actually
 
05:34:18.990 --> 05:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
expect that only a few patients will
 
05:34:20.510 --> 05:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
actually do home cultivation because it
 
05:34:23.390 --> 05:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
is somewhat complicated and takes space
 
05:34:25.230 --> 05:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
going back two years ago TCM would be
 
05:34:27.070 --> 05:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
held a listening session for feedback
 
05:34:28.670 --> 05:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
from patients about the program and the
 
05:34:31.070 --> 05:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
P the primary concerns were afford
 
05:34:33.590 --> 05:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
affordability of product accessibility
 
05:34:36.070 --> 05:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
of atcs and availability of specific
 
05:34:37.830 --> 05:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
strains needed by a patient to treat
 
05:34:39.708 --> 05:34:39.718 align:start position:0%
their symptoms the reason the strain
 
05:34:41.110 --> 05:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
matters is because different cannabis
 
05:34:42.670 --> 05:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
strains have different cannabinoid and
 
05:34:45.350 --> 05:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
turpine profiles and that they therefore
 
05:34:47.110 --> 05:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
have different effects upon the person's
 
05:34:49.310 --> 05:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
symptoms several patients felt that
 
05:34:51.150 --> 05:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
allowing home cultivation would at least
 
05:34:54.150 --> 05:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
partly address these concerns at his
 
05:34:57.750 --> 05:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
January 2023 meeting TCM reviewed the
 
05:35:00.470 --> 05:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
prior Bill HP 431 and voted unanimously
 
05:35:02.390 --> 05:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
that it agrees with the concept of Home
 
05:35:05.430 --> 05:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
cultivation of of cannabis both by
 
05:35:07.750 --> 05:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients and by
 
05:35:10.190 --> 05:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
caregivers then we Revisited it in
 
05:35:12.590 --> 05:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
October of 2023 to review the bill for
 
05:35:14.628 --> 05:35:14.638 align:start position:0%
this year and we agreed to continue our
 
05:35:17.470 --> 05:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
support for the bill uh we did note that
 
05:35:18.948 --> 05:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
there were some concerns voiced last
 
05:35:20.788 --> 05:35:20.798 align:start position:0%
year that home cultivation would
 
05:35:22.310 --> 05:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
somewhat diminish the knowledge of the
 
05:35:24.910 --> 05:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
cannaboid content as we've just been
 
05:35:27.510 --> 05:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
discussing uh compared to the products
 
05:35:30.350 --> 05:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
that are available in atcs we agree that
 
05:35:32.990 --> 05:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
this this is likely to some degree but
 
05:35:34.990 --> 05:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
we note that the bill does allow again a
 
05:35:36.830 --> 05:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
home cultivator to submit their cannabis
 
05:35:38.270 --> 05:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
to a lab for
 
05:35:40.990 --> 05:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
testing and uh this again is important
 
05:35:42.590 --> 05:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
to know the canono profile and to make
 
05:35:45.310 --> 05:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
sure there's no contaminants but again a
 
05:35:46.910 --> 05:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
person growing their own can also be
 
05:35:48.990 --> 05:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
very careful about contaminants by using
 
05:35:51.510 --> 05:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
proper soil and so on and so forth the
 
05:35:53.788 --> 05:35:53.798 align:start position:0%
bill also allows atcs to provide
 
05:35:57.030 --> 05:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
seedlings with know and relative canabo
 
05:35:58.948 --> 05:35:58.958 align:start position:0%
content to assist patients in growing
 
05:36:00.670 --> 05:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
their specific they need for their
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
condition and seeds with no un Target
 
05:36:05.590 --> 05:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
canono content are available and
 
05:36:09.750 --> 05:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
federally legal now the the other thing
 
05:36:11.830 --> 05:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
I think is that if in terms of safety if
 
05:36:13.070 --> 05:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
somebody is growing their own and
 
05:36:14.310 --> 05:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to start using from their
 
05:36:16.788 --> 05:36:16.798 align:start position:0%
first their first part of a batch
 
05:36:18.470 --> 05:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
they'll probably you know drop their
 
05:36:20.510 --> 05:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
dose just a little bit just to kind of
 
05:36:22.830 --> 05:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
see how they how it affects them to make
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
sure in case it perhaps has a little
 
05:36:27.510 --> 05:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
higher THC than they expect but it's
 
05:36:29.750 --> 05:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
also important to realize uh uh
 
05:36:31.310 --> 05:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant did talk about
 
05:36:34.390 --> 05:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
um testing and and I think the other one
 
05:36:37.390 --> 05:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
about um Pharmaceuticals very true but
 
05:36:38.868 --> 05:36:38.878 align:start position:0%
if we think about it generics have a
 
05:36:41.270 --> 05:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
plusus 20% window of
 
05:36:43.350 --> 05:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
acceptability uh and you know we some
 
05:36:45.830 --> 05:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
people is that not
 
05:36:48.868 --> 05:36:48.878 align:start position:0%
correct that was that was a few years
 
05:36:51.470 --> 05:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
ago they've changed it down to plus 10%
 
05:36:53.708 --> 05:36:53.718 align:start position:0%
okay but even then that means you could
 
05:36:56.230 --> 05:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
get one batch here and and the next time
 
05:36:58.708 --> 05:36:58.718 align:start position:0%
you refill it might be 20% more because
 
05:37:02.310 --> 05:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
one was 10% % down there 10% up and I
 
05:37:03.510 --> 05:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
think some of us may have noticed
 
05:37:04.628 --> 05:37:04.638 align:start position:0%
occasionally a little bit of difference
 
05:37:07.030 --> 05:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
in the response uh to a medication
 
05:37:09.230 --> 05:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
anyway um I do have a couple of specific
 
05:37:11.350 --> 05:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
points I want to express at this point
 
05:37:13.310 --> 05:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
I'm now speaking for myself not for CCM
 
05:37:17.030 --> 05:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
o because we voted on the uh uh concept
 
05:37:18.628 --> 05:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
of Home cultivation but we did not
 
05:37:20.110 --> 05:37:20.120 align:start position:0%
really go into the weeds to look at the
 
05:37:22.868 --> 05:37:22.878 align:start position:0%
specific Lage of the bill this bill
 
05:37:24.830 --> 05:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
really has robust protections with
 
05:37:26.670 --> 05:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
respect to limitations in the number of
 
05:37:28.910 --> 05:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis plants and the registration of
 
05:37:30.430 --> 05:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
cultivation sites that have to be
 
05:37:32.390 --> 05:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
enclosed and locked and these
 
05:37:34.390 --> 05:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
protections should make home cultivation
 
05:37:37.070 --> 05:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
safe controlled and should satisfy the
 
05:37:38.590 --> 05:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
concerns of law
 
05:37:41.628 --> 05:37:41.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement I disagree with one issue on
 
05:37:44.070 --> 05:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
page five lines 13 to 18 it allows home
 
05:37:47.350 --> 05:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
cultivation for potential qualifying
 
05:37:49.990 --> 05:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
patients who have not yet been granted a
 
05:37:52.110 --> 05:37:52.120 align:start position:0%
card this could be an enforcement
 
05:37:53.670 --> 05:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
Nightmare and I really feel a patient
 
05:37:55.390 --> 05:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
can wait for the very short time until
 
05:37:56.910 --> 05:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
they have their card good start wrapping
 
05:37:59.230 --> 05:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
up yep I'm I'm just about at the end in
 
05:38:01.190 --> 05:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
fact only one thing Now to respond to
 
05:38:02.390 --> 05:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
something earlier and that was the fate
 
05:38:03.830 --> 05:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
of HB
 
05:38:06.670 --> 05:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
431 uh I must say that it went to a
 
05:38:08.270 --> 05:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
senate committee which has historically
 
05:38:10.910 --> 05:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
been hostile to therapeutic cannabis and
 
05:38:13.310 --> 05:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
I think that's why it was moved uh to D
 
05:38:15.830 --> 05:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
in the table so we urge you to pass
 
05:38:18.910 --> 05:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
12:31 and allow home cultivation the
 
05:38:20.868 --> 05:38:20.878 align:start position:0%
reason being again to help patients with
 
05:38:22.868 --> 05:38:22.878 align:start position:0%
affordability accessibility and
 
05:38:25.150 --> 05:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
availability of specific strains thank
 
05:38:27.628 --> 05:38:27.638 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
05:38:30.350 --> 05:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
questions representative chap
 
05:38:32.470 --> 05:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
yes I know there's been thank you Mr
 
05:38:34.430 --> 05:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
chairman I know there's been a lot of
 
05:38:38.628 --> 05:38:38.638 align:start position:0%
talk about testing and
 
05:38:43.990 --> 05:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
um and um analyzing whether
 
05:38:47.390 --> 05:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
um the amount of therapeutic chemicals
 
05:38:49.548 --> 05:38:49.558 align:start position:0%
and there's also talk about contaminants
 
05:38:51.628 --> 05:38:51.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if there's something
 
05:38:54.708 --> 05:38:54.718 align:start position:0%
specific about cannabis that makes the
 
05:38:58.628 --> 05:38:58.638 align:start position:0%
issue of contaminants extra important
 
05:39:00.030 --> 05:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
because I know
 
05:39:02.750 --> 05:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
you're a serious home Gardener as Ami
 
05:39:05.628 --> 05:39:05.638 align:start position:0%
and you know we might do soil testing
 
05:39:08.070 --> 05:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
once in a while but we don't test every
 
05:39:11.830 --> 05:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
um vegetable we um grow before we eat
 
05:39:15.070 --> 05:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
some of it yeah well so is there
 
05:39:17.628 --> 05:39:17.638 align:start position:0%
something specific about the way we
 
05:39:19.948 --> 05:39:19.958 align:start position:0%
would ingest cannabis that would make
 
05:39:22.628 --> 05:39:22.638 align:start position:0%
the contaminants a more significant
 
05:39:24.948 --> 05:39:24.958 align:start position:0%
issue well first of all there's the
 
05:39:26.590 --> 05:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
issue of heavy metals and so for example
 
05:39:28.788 --> 05:39:28.798 align:start position:0%
when we do a soil test we usually they
 
05:39:30.788 --> 05:39:30.798 align:start position:0%
they EX they automatically do a lead
 
05:39:32.468 --> 05:39:32.478 align:start position:0%
test and you can also do a heavy metal
 
05:39:34.150 --> 05:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
panel for cadmium and other things as
 
05:39:36.868 --> 05:39:36.878 align:start position:0%
well so if somebody is using just soil
 
05:39:38.468 --> 05:39:38.478 align:start position:0%
from their garden and they happen to be
 
05:39:40.030 --> 05:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
in a place where there's a bunch of lead
 
05:39:42.030 --> 05:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
that could be a problem but again if
 
05:39:43.910 --> 05:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
you're if you use your brain a little
 
05:39:45.070 --> 05:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
bit and you're a gardener you know not
 
05:39:49.788 --> 05:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
to to do that um the other thing is mold
 
05:39:51.510 --> 05:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
mold can be a problem because this is a
 
05:39:52.868 --> 05:39:52.878 align:start position:0%
plant and that's actually something that
 
05:39:55.070 --> 05:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
can occur even more if in terms of how
 
05:39:57.030 --> 05:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
you well it can occur how you how you
 
05:39:59.190 --> 05:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
grow it um I don't know about any of you
 
05:40:00.830 --> 05:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
but have a greenhouse and I do sometimes
 
05:40:02.310 --> 05:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
have problems with mold because of
 
05:40:04.230 --> 05:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
humidity and so on and so forth so one
 
05:40:06.310 --> 05:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
has to be cautious about that you can
 
05:40:08.510 --> 05:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
often see it but sometimes that may be a
 
05:40:11.110 --> 05:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
little bit difficult to see um if a
 
05:40:12.390 --> 05:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
storage of course you could still get
 
05:40:14.350 --> 05:40:14.360 align:start position:0%
mold if you're storing it in a moist
 
05:40:17.430 --> 05:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
fashion but uh their basic issues about
 
05:40:19.390 --> 05:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
primarily heavy metals and mold are the
 
05:40:21.310 --> 05:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
other major things that we look at as
 
05:40:23.350 --> 05:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
far as contaminants so those are nothing
 
05:40:25.750 --> 05:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
unusual and as far as yeah we don't grow
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
we don't test every plant we sort of do
 
05:40:30.788 --> 05:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
we take a bite of that tomato and go
 
05:40:32.910 --> 05:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
that didn't turn out so well and with
 
05:40:34.788 --> 05:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
this one because you are either inhaling
 
05:40:37.110 --> 05:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
it or or taking it we do want it is
 
05:40:39.030 --> 05:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
important that you have a rough idea but
 
05:40:41.390 --> 05:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
again you can get a Seedling with no un
 
05:40:44.430 --> 05:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
cannaboid contents or you can get seeds
 
05:40:46.750 --> 05:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
which have at least a range that'll tell
 
05:40:49.310 --> 05:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
you what what it's going to
 
05:40:52.390 --> 05:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
grow other
 
05:40:54.990 --> 05:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative Nagel thank you
 
05:40:58.510 --> 05:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you honorable Dr kerk
 
05:41:00.510 --> 05:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
um I I just have a quick question that I
 
05:41:02.030 --> 05:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if you know the answer maybe
 
05:41:04.830 --> 05:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
a dispensary person does but I mean to
 
05:41:07.510 --> 05:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
visit one of these dispensaries is eye
 
05:41:09.948 --> 05:41:09.958 align:start position:0%
opening I mean it was pretty amazing and
 
05:41:12.070 --> 05:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious it would be
 
05:41:14.350 --> 05:41:14.360 align:start position:0%
totally difficult for everybody here to
 
05:41:16.270 --> 05:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
go visit one but I would assume somebody
 
05:41:18.310 --> 05:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
must have a video or something about
 
05:41:21.150 --> 05:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
cultivation the process what did they go
 
05:41:23.190 --> 05:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
through in in the dispensary setting do
 
05:41:25.990 --> 05:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know if that exists I'm sure there
 
05:41:27.510 --> 05:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
probably are a lot of videos I know when
 
05:41:30.190 --> 05:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
I've looked up specific issues about
 
05:41:32.670 --> 05:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
uh lighting for for uh growing
 
05:41:34.310 --> 05:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
Greenhouse or whatever you get lots of
 
05:41:36.468 --> 05:41:36.478 align:start position:0%
hits that have to do with uh cannabis
 
05:41:39.430 --> 05:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
growing for some reason but
 
05:41:41.750 --> 05:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean I think people would be
 
05:41:44.468 --> 05:41:44.478 align:start position:0%
able to find issues and and again if
 
05:41:45.788 --> 05:41:45.798 align:start position:0%
remember these plants are kind of big
 
05:41:47.190 --> 05:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
too so it's going to be a little bit
 
05:41:49.868 --> 05:41:49.878 align:start position:0%
tricky for a lot of people to grow them
 
05:41:52.150 --> 05:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
um and they have to be enclosed and they
 
05:41:55.150 --> 05:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
can't be out near just your garden so
 
05:41:57.430 --> 05:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
yeah but I they could perhaps give you
 
05:41:58.628 --> 05:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
more but I'm I'm sure there's some
 
05:42:00.548 --> 05:42:00.558 align:start position:0%
videos I haven't done a Google search
 
05:42:02.270 --> 05:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
but I bet you there's
 
05:42:05.830 --> 05:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:08.190 --> 05:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing done all right
 
05:42:13.150 --> 05:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:16.468 --> 05:42:16.478 align:start position:0%
much also signed up to speak is Jo Dr
 
05:42:16.478 --> 05:42:24.150 align:start position:0%
much also signed up to speak is Jo Dr
Joe

05:42:24.150 --> 05:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:26.548 --> 05:42:26.558 align:start position:0%
Hannon hello again thank you last time
 
05:42:29.830 --> 05:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
today promise um
 
05:42:32.070 --> 05:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
so I I try not to repeat things that
 
05:42:33.750 --> 05:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
were already said we we heard a lot of
 
05:42:36.350 --> 05:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh great testimony so far uh when I was
 
05:42:37.548 --> 05:42:37.558 align:start position:0%
here I was on the Commerce Committee we
 
05:42:39.070 --> 05:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
did a lot of the alcohol bills I sat on
 
05:42:40.708 --> 05:42:40.718 align:start position:0%
a commission to study that and some
 
05:42:42.468 --> 05:42:42.478 align:start position:0%
other commissions I was also like I said
 
05:42:45.430 --> 05:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
a study commission for cannabis uh and
 
05:42:48.030 --> 05:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
hom grow was always a topic that came up
 
05:42:49.548 --> 05:42:49.558 align:start position:0%
um when and the first commission and
 
05:42:51.110 --> 05:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
even this one it got mentioned but
 
05:42:54.430 --> 05:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
didn't really get looked at um it we're
 
05:42:56.310 --> 05:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
talking about home grow for medicine
 
05:42:58.190 --> 05:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
we're not just this isn't recreational
 
05:43:00.310 --> 05:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
nothing else we all know that but we
 
05:43:01.948 --> 05:43:01.958 align:start position:0%
allow home brew and I'm sure most of you
 
05:43:04.628 --> 05:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
are aware for beer and wine of less than
 
05:43:07.190 --> 05:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
6% alcohol by volume uh a single
 
05:43:09.270 --> 05:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
individual can have a 100 gallons a year
 
05:43:11.670 --> 05:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
every year and stock pilot so there's no
 
05:43:13.230 --> 05:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
possession limit you can have after 10
 
05:43:15.590 --> 05:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
years you can have you know a thousand
 
05:43:17.708 --> 05:43:17.718 align:start position:0%
gallons of it if you're have a spouse or
 
05:43:19.230 --> 05:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
another adult in the house over 21 you
 
05:43:20.948 --> 05:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
can grow up to 200 gallons maximum per
 
05:43:23.110 --> 05:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
household that's equivalent to six beers
 
05:43:26.150 --> 05:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
a day so I can have a if my wife and I
 
05:43:28.070 --> 05:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to brew it and we don't but if we
 
05:43:29.468 --> 05:43:29.478 align:start position:0%
did we could have a sixpack back every
 
05:43:31.190 --> 05:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
night just from home brew now the
 
05:43:33.910 --> 05:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
regulations are zero there is a limit on
 
05:43:34.990 --> 05:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
how much alcohol you're allowed to have
 
05:43:37.390 --> 05:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
and how many gallons there is no license
 
05:43:40.030 --> 05:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
no one has to be notified there is no
 
05:43:41.350 --> 05:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
testing requirement to make sure it's
 
05:43:44.190 --> 05:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
only 6% or less I mean it could be 7%
 
05:43:45.910 --> 05:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
accidentally there's never been a
 
05:43:48.190 --> 05:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
reported problem uh you just can't sell
 
05:43:49.510 --> 05:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
it and I haven't seen anything in the
 
05:43:51.708 --> 05:43:51.718 align:start position:0%
news if if it's happened I'd love to
 
05:43:52.750 --> 05:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
hear about it because I've testified
 
05:43:54.788 --> 05:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
about this before it's a
 
05:43:58.468 --> 05:43:58.478 align:start position:0%
non-issue um allowing a small amount and
 
05:44:00.830 --> 05:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
50 100 foot canopy that is a very small
 
05:44:01.830 --> 05:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
space if you ever seen some of these
 
05:44:04.070 --> 05:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
grow facilities I've killed Cactus I
 
05:44:06.910 --> 05:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
don't plan on doing this um it's not
 
05:44:08.948 --> 05:44:08.958 align:start position:0%
easy to do for everybody but we're also
 
05:44:10.310 --> 05:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
not talking about manufacturing a
 
05:44:12.270 --> 05:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
complex pharmaceutical product
 
05:44:13.910 --> 05:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily I mean there are
 
05:44:16.150 --> 05:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
complexities in the Cannabis uh you know
 
05:44:18.468 --> 05:44:18.478 align:start position:0%
field and they can they can vary but
 
05:44:21.270 --> 05:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
you're getting cannabis of some form uh
 
05:44:22.590 --> 05:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
you're not having to worry about you
 
05:44:25.310 --> 05:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
know getting insulin from a do from a
 
05:44:26.990 --> 05:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
dog and all this there's so many things
 
05:44:29.270 --> 05:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
you need to do also I'm legally allowed
 
05:44:30.830 --> 05:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
to grow any number of poisonous
 
05:44:32.708 --> 05:44:32.718 align:start position:0%
substances in New Hampshire in my garden
 
05:44:35.070 --> 05:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
legally no regulations whatsoever
 
05:44:36.948 --> 05:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
there's mainly two poisonous plants in
 
05:44:38.468 --> 05:44:38.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire poison hemlock and poke
 
05:44:40.548 --> 05:44:40.558 align:start position:0%
weed uh they are indigenous in New
 
05:44:41.868 --> 05:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they're just you go and you
 
05:44:43.310 --> 05:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
can probably find them somewhere they're
 
05:44:46.590 --> 05:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
here but I can grow black cherries uh
 
05:44:48.510 --> 05:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
apple seeds contain cyanide too many can
 
05:44:49.708 --> 05:44:49.718 align:start position:0%
kill a horse when horses eat lots of
 
05:44:50.788 --> 05:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
them on the ground they can cause
 
05:44:53.070 --> 05:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
problems there but you know Fox gloves
 
05:44:54.510 --> 05:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
we get digitalis which is a heart
 
05:44:56.110 --> 05:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
medication from Fox Glove I can grow
 
05:44:57.990 --> 05:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
that if I wanted to no regulations no
 
05:44:59.350 --> 05:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
license whatsoever don't have to tell
 
05:45:03.070 --> 05:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
anybody at the state no offense um so
 
05:45:05.110 --> 05:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
the lily of the valleys Angel's trumpets
 
05:45:06.670 --> 05:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
morning glories there's any number of
 
05:45:09.510 --> 05:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
plants Oleander some beautiful plants
 
05:45:10.670 --> 05:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
many of you probably have had them in
 
05:45:12.030 --> 05:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
your Gardens or seen them in gardens or
 
05:45:14.350 --> 05:45:14.360 align:start position:0%
at flower shows they could kill
 
05:45:17.070 --> 05:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
you cannabis will not kill you I mean
 
05:45:18.830 --> 05:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
it's possible if a bail of it falls on
 
05:45:20.830 --> 05:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
your head there may be a death related
 
05:45:22.390 --> 05:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
to it when it happens I'm sure it'll be
 
05:45:25.548 --> 05:45:25.558 align:start position:0%
news um but like I said there's no
 
05:45:26.868 --> 05:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
requirements for testing and that and if
 
05:45:28.468 --> 05:45:28.478 align:start position:0%
we're looking at we keep hearing in
 
05:45:29.430 --> 05:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
other you know I don't want to talk
 
05:45:31.390 --> 05:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
about other bills and committees but we
 
05:45:33.190 --> 05:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
they talk about legalization like
 
05:45:34.708 --> 05:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
alcohol if you're going to do it like
 
05:45:37.070 --> 05:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
alcohol uh this is nothing like alcohol
 
05:45:38.628 --> 05:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
alcohol will be way I mean if this was
 
05:45:40.350 --> 05:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
like that You' be able to have hom grow
 
05:45:43.150 --> 05:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
for any reason so I think it's
 
05:45:45.310 --> 05:45:45.320 align:start position:0%
it's I just want you to legalized
 
05:45:47.468 --> 05:45:47.478 align:start position:0%
gardening fully legalized gardening
 
05:45:49.990 --> 05:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's it you know it's very simple it's
 
05:45:51.670 --> 05:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
the only thing you really can't legally
 
05:45:53.868 --> 05:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
grow except you can even grow other
 
05:45:55.548 --> 05:45:55.558 align:start position:0%
really poisonous you know narcotic
 
05:45:59.070 --> 05:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
things but um you can't do this could
 
05:46:00.708 --> 05:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
place yes last thing the physical and
 
05:46:02.390 --> 05:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
mental benefits of gardening we talked
 
05:46:04.948 --> 05:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
about anxiety earlier being a big thing
 
05:46:06.670 --> 05:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry uh I didn't tell you I
 
05:46:08.390 --> 05:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
was ready for three minutes this time
 
05:46:11.708 --> 05:46:11.718 align:start position:0%
sorry um but the benefits of uh the
 
05:46:13.070 --> 05:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
medical the mental health and the
 
05:46:15.030 --> 05:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
physical benefits of gardening are are
 
05:46:17.070 --> 05:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
well known they're well documented in
 
05:46:19.910 --> 05:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
research uh just being outside or the
 
05:46:22.150 --> 05:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
act of gardening has been beneficial and
 
05:46:23.670 --> 05:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
if anxiety is one of the leading
 
05:46:25.110 --> 05:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
reported reasons that are people are
 
05:46:28.468 --> 05:46:28.478 align:start position:0%
using this get outside enjoy yourself
 
05:46:30.310 --> 05:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:46:31.948 --> 05:46:31.958 align:start position:0%
have it more therapeutic just by doing
 
05:46:33.350 --> 05:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
that so there there are health benefits
 
05:46:35.270 --> 05:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
other than environmental and cost so
 
05:46:36.868 --> 05:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
please pass this bill and then we can
 
05:46:38.708 --> 05:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
stop hearing about it for the next 12
 
05:46:44.070 --> 05:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
years or so 15 years thank you
 
05:46:49.510 --> 05:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:52.030 --> 05:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Bill
 
05:46:57.708 --> 05:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:57.718 --> 05:47:00.830 align:start position:0%
 
Police

05:47:00.830 --> 05:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:02.350 --> 05:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman good afternoon
 
05:47:03.510 --> 05:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
05:47:06.030 --> 05:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony uh my name is Bill
 
05:47:07.548 --> 05:47:07.558 align:start position:0%
bright I am a major with the New
 
05:47:09.590 --> 05:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police I currently
 
05:47:11.190 --> 05:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
oversee the Investigative Services
 
05:47:13.030 --> 05:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
Bureau which includes all detectives for
 
05:47:17.030 --> 05:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
state police um I I came to speak to you
 
05:47:19.990 --> 05:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
today in opposition of this bill
 
05:47:22.750 --> 05:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
um mostly because I just would like the
 
05:47:24.910 --> 05:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
committee to consider uh the effects
 
05:47:27.910 --> 05:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
that it may have on law enforcement to
 
05:47:29.510 --> 05:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
enforce some of the the regulations that
 
05:47:32.270 --> 05:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
are in this bill um the difficulty that
 
05:47:34.548 --> 05:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
we may have uh
 
05:47:38.708 --> 05:47:38.718 align:start position:0%
determining um who is legally a able to
 
05:47:41.468 --> 05:47:41.478 align:start position:0%
grow um I know there's a a portion
 
05:47:43.350 --> 05:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
carved out in this bill that says that
 
05:47:46.070 --> 05:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
we could submit a a sworn affidavit uh
 
05:47:49.590 --> 05:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
to get some of that information um as
 
05:47:53.830 --> 05:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
well as who is if they are legally a
 
05:47:56.750 --> 05:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
able to grow are they within the
 
05:47:59.150 --> 05:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
regulations and if they're not does that
 
05:48:01.468 --> 05:48:01.478 align:start position:0%
F then turn into a criminal
 
05:48:03.788 --> 05:48:03.798 align:start position:0%
investigation or who is regulating that
 
05:48:06.628 --> 05:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
part of um that determination in this
 
05:48:09.150 --> 05:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
law um the example I would give to you
 
05:48:12.628 --> 05:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
is that if we receive a complaint that
 
05:48:17.110 --> 05:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh somebody who is opposed to growing
 
05:48:19.590 --> 05:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
marijuana complains that that they
 
05:48:21.190 --> 05:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
believe that somebody is illegally
 
05:48:23.430 --> 05:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
growing marijuana we we're obligated to
 
05:48:26.788 --> 05:48:26.798 align:start position:0%
go investigate that complaint um once we
 
05:48:28.868 --> 05:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
get there we may or may not be able to
 
05:48:31.110 --> 05:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
determine uh in a short period of time
 
05:48:33.868 --> 05:48:33.878 align:start position:0%
whether the person is allowed to be able
 
05:48:36.548 --> 05:48:36.558 align:start position:0%
to grow um which will cause some further
 
05:48:39.830 --> 05:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
steps for law enforcement to take uh
 
05:48:42.190 --> 05:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
eating up resources that could be better
 
05:48:45.830 --> 05:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
used in other places um we would then
 
05:48:48.310 --> 05:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
have to determine whether or not if they
 
05:48:51.150 --> 05:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
were legally able able to grow if they
 
05:48:53.030 --> 05:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
were within the the proper uh
 
05:48:55.548 --> 05:48:55.558 align:start position:0%
regulations and as I mentioned um if
 
05:48:58.628 --> 05:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
they are not um is that does that then
 
05:49:01.390 --> 05:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
turn into a you have a
 
05:49:03.910 --> 05:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
patient uh who we are now criminally
 
05:49:07.868 --> 05:49:07.878 align:start position:0%
investigating for um the possession of
 
05:49:09.750 --> 05:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana outside of what they are
 
05:49:12.430 --> 05:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to have so I just think it it is
 
05:49:13.910 --> 05:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
a difficult situation to put law
 
05:49:16.990 --> 05:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement in um to allow the home grow
 
05:49:18.868 --> 05:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
um in this
 
05:49:18.878 --> 05:49:20.430 align:start position:0%
um in this
instance

05:49:20.430 --> 05:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
instance
 
05:49:24.110 --> 05:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
where patients are able to get what they
 
05:49:26.910 --> 05:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
need from the therapeutic grow uh
 
05:49:29.190 --> 05:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
authorized therapeutic grow um
 
05:49:31.868 --> 05:49:31.878 align:start position:0%
facilities now that is just much cleaner
 
05:49:34.590 --> 05:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:37.868 --> 05:49:37.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement okay thank you
 
05:49:40.468 --> 05:49:40.478 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lon um thank
 
05:49:42.230 --> 05:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for coming
 
05:49:45.350 --> 05:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
with constructive feedback on this um I
 
05:49:47.430 --> 05:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
would be interested in in trying to
 
05:49:48.948 --> 05:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
figure out specifically what you would
 
05:49:51.030 --> 05:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
need in order to make that determination
 
05:49:53.350 --> 05:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
ahead of time because I know that
 
05:49:55.510 --> 05:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
typically when you're dealing with drug
 
05:49:57.868 --> 05:49:57.878 align:start position:0%
grows um those are probably the more
 
05:50:00.310 --> 05:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
dynamic situations as opposed to more of
 
05:50:02.070 --> 05:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
a wellness check so I don't know if
 
05:50:03.390 --> 05:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
there's anything with checking with the
 
05:50:04.788 --> 05:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
department or if there's anything else
 
05:50:07.150 --> 05:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
that we can do to streamline this so
 
05:50:08.868 --> 05:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
that we're not denying patients this
 
05:50:10.990 --> 05:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
ability when it's appropriate but we're
 
05:50:13.628 --> 05:50:13.638 align:start position:0%
also not putting law enforcement um in a
 
05:50:17.190 --> 05:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
bad situation yeah so I think that in
 
05:50:19.070 --> 05:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
order to get the information what the
 
05:50:20.948 --> 05:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
bill says that we would need a sworn
 
05:50:24.788 --> 05:50:24.798 align:start position:0%
affidavit uh that we have probable cause
 
05:50:27.390 --> 05:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
to believe uh that that that somebody is
 
05:50:30.548 --> 05:50:30.558 align:start position:0%
is growing marij Marana um just the word
 
05:50:32.390 --> 05:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
that we get from from somebody that they
 
05:50:34.350 --> 05:50:34.360 align:start position:0%
think their neighbor is growing is not
 
05:50:35.948 --> 05:50:35.958 align:start position:0%
necessarily probable cause so there
 
05:50:37.670 --> 05:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
would take it would take some leg work
 
05:50:41.190 --> 05:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to get develop probable cause
 
05:50:44.948 --> 05:50:44.958 align:start position:0%
uh to determine that um which is going
 
05:50:47.150 --> 05:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
to present some problems and some
 
05:50:52.350 --> 05:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
investigative work on law enforcement um
 
05:50:54.868 --> 05:50:54.878 align:start position:0%
standpoint so as a follow sorry as a
 
05:50:57.030 --> 05:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
followup um then would would that make
 
05:50:59.270 --> 05:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
sense if we put into process that prior
 
05:51:02.230 --> 05:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
to um pursuing a sworn off of davit um
 
05:51:04.110 --> 05:51:04.120 align:start position:0%
that you would cross check with the I
 
05:51:05.510 --> 05:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
believe I believe we said that we'd
 
05:51:07.270 --> 05:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
already know the locations within the
 
05:51:09.350 --> 05:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
whole the whole therapeutic cannabis
 
05:51:11.708 --> 05:51:11.718 align:start position:0%
commission to to make sure that if you
 
05:51:13.150 --> 05:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
were pursuing one of these that you
 
05:51:15.788 --> 05:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
could confirm whether or not there was
 
05:51:19.868 --> 05:51:19.878 align:start position:0%
an um an allowed homow operation at that
 
05:51:22.190 --> 05:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
address before pursuing further well I
 
05:51:24.468 --> 05:51:24.478 align:start position:0%
believe from uh previous testimony I
 
05:51:26.548 --> 05:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
mean this would fall under uh hippo
 
05:51:28.628 --> 05:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
regulations which my understanding was
 
05:51:30.868 --> 05:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
is that we would need to supply a a
 
05:51:33.868 --> 05:51:33.878 align:start position:0%
supporting affidavit with probable cause
 
05:51:36.030 --> 05:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
um I I'll pursue that further with you
 
05:51:38.830 --> 05:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
because uh Hippa Hippa allows a lot of
 
05:51:40.190 --> 05:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
move movement of information I don't
 
05:51:42.070 --> 05:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
claim to be an expert so I I probably
 
05:51:44.070 --> 05:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
won't be able to answer your questions
 
05:51:46.430 --> 05:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
intelligently okay thank
 
05:51:49.230 --> 05:51:49.240 align:start position:0%
you other questions representative
 
05:51:52.548 --> 05:51:52.558 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also
 
05:51:56.390 --> 05:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Bri for taking my
 
05:51:59.150 --> 05:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
question I hear the concern about law
 
05:52:01.390 --> 05:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement being sort of in a bind
 
05:52:03.510 --> 05:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
you've got call to resident you don't
 
05:52:04.830 --> 05:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
know whether the resident has the
 
05:52:07.548 --> 05:52:07.558 align:start position:0%
authority to grow if I understand it
 
05:52:09.510 --> 05:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
correctly if the department was to
 
05:52:12.150 --> 05:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
provide to the resident a document
 
05:52:14.030 --> 05:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's notorized and so forth that they
 
05:52:15.350 --> 05:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
could give to law
 
05:52:17.910 --> 05:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement that authorized them to do
 
05:52:19.788 --> 05:52:19.798 align:start position:0%
that would that minimize some of the
 
05:52:21.468 --> 05:52:21.478 align:start position:0%
concern you
 
05:52:23.990 --> 05:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
have well I don't I don't know that I
 
05:52:25.708 --> 05:52:25.718 align:start position:0%
can think of every situation that would
 
05:52:27.628 --> 05:52:27.638 align:start position:0%
be difficult for law enforcement um
 
05:52:30.070 --> 05:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
based on you know the result of this
 
05:52:33.030 --> 05:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
this bill so it's hard for me to um you
 
05:52:35.628 --> 05:52:35.638 align:start position:0%
know come up with a with a suggestion
 
05:52:38.868 --> 05:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
for what would alleviate I think that it
 
05:52:44.548 --> 05:52:44.558 align:start position:0%
just it leaves open the ability to abuse
 
05:52:48.030 --> 05:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
um the the right to grow marijuana in a
 
05:52:50.590 --> 05:52:50.600 align:start position:0%
hom grow situation which would I think
 
05:52:52.948 --> 05:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
is going to create problems for law
 
05:52:56.390 --> 05:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement um kind of no matter how it
 
05:53:00.468 --> 05:53:00.478 align:start position:0%
is set up uh in the framework of this
 
05:53:04.070 --> 05:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
bill follow up thank you and following
 
05:53:05.868 --> 05:53:05.878 align:start position:0%
up on the Hippa concern my understanding
 
05:53:07.708 --> 05:53:07.718 align:start position:0%
within Hippa law enforcement actually
 
05:53:10.628 --> 05:53:10.638 align:start position:0%
has some limited authority to the
 
05:53:13.070 --> 05:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
information within Hippa so therefore
 
05:53:16.030 --> 05:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
you may have as law enforcement some
 
05:53:18.030 --> 05:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
limited access to that database to begin
 
05:53:19.270 --> 05:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
with so I don't know if that solves a
 
05:53:20.310 --> 05:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
problem but something you may want to
 
05:53:22.310 --> 05:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
consider well I don't know if I don't
 
05:53:25.590 --> 05:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
know if um finding this information
 
05:53:27.830 --> 05:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
would fall under those regulations and
 
05:53:30.510 --> 05:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
the the allowances that we would
 
05:53:34.390 --> 05:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:37.030 --> 05:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
05:53:37.040 --> 05:53:41.868 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
thank

05:53:41.868 --> 05:53:41.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:45.020 --> 05:53:45.030 align:start position:0%
you next up I believe it's Jim rle from
 
05:53:45.030 --> 05:53:50.868 align:start position:0%
you next up I believe it's Jim rle from
[Music]

05:53:50.868 --> 05:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:53.510 --> 05:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro thank you Mr chair members of
 
05:53:56.628 --> 05:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
the committee Jim Riddle Hillsboro and I
 
05:54:00.030 --> 05:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh mentioned earlier that do have a USDA
 
05:54:03.230 --> 05:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
hemp grower license and in order to get
 
05:54:05.230 --> 05:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
that license the first thing I needed to
 
05:54:08.750 --> 05:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
do was go to my local police station and
 
05:54:11.830 --> 05:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
be fingerprinted then I had to pay to
 
05:54:14.948 --> 05:54:14.958 align:start position:0%
have an FBI background check then I had
 
05:54:18.190 --> 05:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
to take online training from USDA I had
 
05:54:21.350 --> 05:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
to set up h a farm number with the Farm
 
05:54:24.150 --> 05:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
Service Agency and then do annual
 
05:54:27.708 --> 05:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
reports and hemp and cannabis it's the
 
05:54:32.830 --> 05:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
same species cannab Cannabis sativa and
 
05:54:36.270 --> 05:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
before Harvest any crop has to be tested
 
05:54:39.468 --> 05:54:39.478 align:start position:0%
if it's over point or
 
05:54:43.548 --> 05:54:43.558 align:start position:0%
0.3% THC then it falls under cannabis
 
05:54:45.788 --> 05:54:45.798 align:start position:0%
regulations under my hemp it gets
 
05:54:49.230 --> 05:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
destroyed goes into the compost pile um
 
05:54:53.510 --> 05:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
but uh in case you don't know the DEA
 
05:54:57.230 --> 05:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
officially ruled uh that any cannabis
 
05:55:02.030 --> 05:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
seeds and seedlings are technically hemp
 
05:55:05.670 --> 05:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
because they contain no THC they don't
 
05:55:09.590 --> 05:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
meet that 3% so DEA has officially
 
05:55:11.750 --> 05:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
determined that any cannabis seed
 
05:55:14.910 --> 05:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of its genetic potential uh
 
05:55:18.430 --> 05:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
uh is hemp uh so just uh to be clear on
 
05:55:21.468 --> 05:55:21.478 align:start position:0%
that I did um also mention earlier that
 
05:55:23.788 --> 05:55:23.798 align:start position:0%
I'm on The Advisory Board of the New
 
05:55:25.510 --> 05:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cannabis Association I just
 
05:55:28.030 --> 05:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh let you know I let an
 
05:55:29.670 --> 05:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
effort working with the New Hampshire
 
05:55:32.230 --> 05:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
Farm Bureau and the Northeast organic
 
05:55:34.868 --> 05:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
Farmers Association of New Hampshire to
 
05:55:38.150 --> 05:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
do a survey last fall of farmers in the
 
05:55:41.230 --> 05:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
granite state to see uh uh and this was
 
05:55:44.390 --> 05:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
more about legalization but of the
 
05:55:46.150 --> 05:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
farmers that responded
 
05:55:49.910 --> 05:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
87% supported legalization and
 
05:55:52.430 --> 05:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
78% of the respondents were interested
 
05:55:55.270 --> 05:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
in becoming licensed Growers but as it
 
05:55:58.350 --> 05:55:58.360 align:start position:0%
relates to our discussion right now the
 
05:56:01.070 --> 05:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
most surprising result the question we
 
05:56:04.548 --> 05:56:04.558 align:start position:0%
asked about support for homegrown that
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
was the strongest uh response we had got
 
05:56:10.788 --> 05:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
89% of the respondant support allowing
 
05:56:12.868 --> 05:56:12.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents to grow six to
 
05:56:15.468 --> 05:56:15.478 align:start position:0%
eight plants uh for home use and that
 
05:56:18.070 --> 05:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't you know specifically only
 
05:56:20.110 --> 05:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
limited to Medical but there is
 
05:56:22.150 --> 05:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
certainly an interest and support in the
 
05:56:25.150 --> 05:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
agricultural Community uh for allowing
 
05:56:31.190 --> 05:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
home grow um I I think uh something here
 
05:56:33.910 --> 05:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's really an advantage of focusing
 
05:56:35.948 --> 05:56:35.958 align:start position:0%
on the people with medical cards and
 
05:56:37.868 --> 05:56:37.878 align:start position:0%
that's the first thing I would do if as
 
05:56:40.510 --> 05:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
an officer was making an inquiry is show
 
05:56:42.670 --> 05:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
my card and then if I have gotten a
 
05:56:45.390 --> 05:56:45.400 align:start position:0%
permit to have a few plants I would
 
05:56:47.708 --> 05:56:47.718 align:start position:0%
probably have an additional paperwork
 
05:56:50.510 --> 05:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
showing that I can have these plants but
 
05:56:53.628 --> 05:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
these are registered grower registered
 
05:56:56.070 --> 05:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
people all the people that have medical
 
05:56:58.510 --> 05:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
cards are already in the system system
 
05:57:01.270 --> 05:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
you know who we are and we would have to
 
05:57:04.910 --> 05:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
apply further to grow a few plants um
 
05:57:06.390 --> 05:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
like it was
 
05:57:09.868 --> 05:57:09.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned seeds are hemp they can be
 
05:57:12.548 --> 05:57:12.558 align:start position:0%
sold through the mail right now
 
05:57:15.868 --> 05:57:15.878 align:start position:0%
Interstate you anyone in New Hampshire
 
05:57:19.110 --> 05:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
can have access to thousands of strains
 
05:57:22.830 --> 05:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
through online companies um so they can
 
05:57:26.030 --> 05:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
tailor that and yeah they may send it to
 
05:57:27.830 --> 05:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
a lab for analysis but they might just
 
05:57:31.150 --> 05:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
just try it and adjust their dose uh to
 
05:57:34.270 --> 05:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
what they've uh grown but it will really
 
05:57:37.948 --> 05:57:37.958 align:start position:0%
help both reduce cost improve access and
 
05:57:40.468 --> 05:57:40.478 align:start position:0%
availability and I just closed by
 
05:57:42.910 --> 05:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
echoing something that Dr Hannah said
 
05:57:46.910 --> 05:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
just growing cannabis growing hemp
 
05:57:49.590 --> 05:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
growing plants in and of itself is
 
05:57:52.190 --> 05:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
therapeutic you develop a relationship
 
05:57:55.030 --> 05:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
you're caring for something and uh that
 
05:57:57.430 --> 05:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
alone uh I I think should be taken into
 
05:57:59.708 --> 05:57:59.718 align:start position:0%
consider consideration thank you thank
 
05:58:01.590 --> 05:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
you any
 
05:58:05.868 --> 05:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:19.510 --> 05:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:21.548 --> 05:58:21.558 align:start position:0%

healthcare consists of three three

pillars access cost and quality this is
 
05:59:03.190 --> 05:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
a well-studied phenomenon in healthcare
 
05:59:05.390 --> 05:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
because no system has ever been able to
 
05:59:06.868 --> 05:59:06.878 align:start position:0%
improve all three of these
 
05:59:08.628 --> 05:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
simultaneously there is always a

what many disabled medical patients can
 
05:59:47.868 --> 05:59:47.878 align:start position:0%
afford making it again inaccessible as
 
05:59:50.310 --> 05:59:50.320 align:start position:0%

also matters many cannabis patients
 
06:00:01.230 --> 06:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
prefer specific strains with unique
 
06:00:03.548 --> 06:00:03.558 align:start position:0%
chemical profiles that can be difficult
 
06:00:05.548 --> 06:00:05.558 align:start position:0%
to lock down in dispensaries as the
 
06:00:07.830 --> 06:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
strains are often being rotated to fit
 
06:00:10.190 --> 06:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
consumer demand and the available
 
06:00:11.910 --> 06:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
options may not fill the niche of what
 
06:00:13.548 --> 06:00:13.558 align:start position:0%
they're looking for for their desired
 
06:00:15.910 --> 06:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic benefits or they prefer
 
06:00:17.910 --> 06:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
specific metrics like heighten moisture
 
06:00:19.670 --> 06:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
content that aren't allowed to be

variable uh via dispensary Avenues some
 
06:00:24.830 --> 06:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
examples of this strain preference that
 
06:00:26.750 --> 06:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
we discussed earlier include people with
 
06:00:28.948 --> 06:00:28.958 align:start position:0%

favoring strains dominant in the tpine
 
06:00:35.110 --> 06:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
caropine and people with metabolic

conditions preferring strains high in
 
06:00:40.270 --> 06:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
thcv and the list goes on patients can
 
06:00:42.868 --> 06:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
have access to consistent personalized
 
06:00:44.670 --> 06:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
and effective medicine when cultivating
 
06:00:46.468 --> 06:00:46.478 align:start position:0%
at home and have the spiritual
 
06:00:48.628 --> 06:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
connection to their medicine as well I
 
06:00:50.230 --> 06:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
know this isn't important to everyone in
 
06:00:51.868 --> 06:00:51.878 align:start position:0%
this room but for people like me who
 
06:00:54.030 --> 06:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
prefer to use natural products and find
 
06:00:56.310 --> 06:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
Value in cultivating their medicine the
 
06:00:58.468 --> 06:00:58.478 align:start position:0%
spirituality component is an undeniable
 
06:01:00.590 --> 06:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
and core value for our community and
 
06:01:02.230 --> 06:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
greatly contributes to the healing
 
06:01:04.948 --> 06:01:04.958 align:start position:0%
process and intention while medicating
 
06:01:06.708 --> 06:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it is difficult to see
 
06:01:08.190 --> 06:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
negatives to the ability to grow this
 
06:01:10.868 --> 06:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
medicinal plant it does not come down to
 
06:01:13.310 --> 06:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
the safety of New Hampshire residents it
 
06:01:15.270 --> 06:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
comes down to control of who we get
 
06:01:17.110 --> 06:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
where of where we get our medicine and
 
06:01:19.070 --> 06:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
who financially benefits from us using
 
06:01:20.990 --> 06:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
this medicine this contradicts
 
06:01:22.708 --> 06:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
everything about the Live Free or Die
 
06:01:25.270 --> 06:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
mentality that emphasizes and it does
 
06:01:26.868 --> 06:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
emphasize everything wrong with the
 
06:01:29.070 --> 06:01:29.080 align:start position:0%
current health care landscape and if we
 
06:01:31.110 --> 06:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
continue to restrict hom grow we should
 
06:01:33.270 --> 06:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
reconsider the slogan Live Free or Die
 
06:01:35.510 --> 06:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
or I guess we're all supposed to
 
06:01:38.868 --> 06:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
die to Dr Joe hannon's point I'm a
 
06:01:40.548 --> 06:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
natural product chemist and I'm allowed
 
06:01:43.030 --> 06:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
to legally wrapping up what was that
 
06:01:44.390 --> 06:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
please please start wrapping up your
 
06:01:46.468 --> 06:01:46.478 align:start position:0%
testimony okay I'll wrap up to Dr
 
06:01:48.110 --> 06:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
johannah's point I'm a natural product
 
06:01:49.670 --> 06:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
chemist and I'm allowed to legally grow
 
06:01:51.390 --> 06:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
dozens of plants that are toxic and
 
06:01:53.708 --> 06:01:53.718 align:start position:0%
small doses including the Opium poppy
 
06:01:55.708 --> 06:01:55.718 align:start position:0%
that produces Codine and morphine the
 
06:01:58.030 --> 06:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
cter plant which produces
 
06:02:00.788 --> 06:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
a Tropa belladon Fox Glove and so many
 
06:02:03.830 --> 06:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
more I have yet to hear a solid argument
 
06:02:05.150 --> 06:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
against hom grow other than the fact
 
06:02:06.310 --> 06:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
that some people just don't like
 
06:02:08.110 --> 06:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis I don't think this is a just
 
06:02:09.430 --> 06:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
answer and it should be a right to
 
06:02:11.628 --> 06:02:11.638 align:start position:0%
cultivate the medicinal plant and to be
 
06:02:12.868 --> 06:02:12.878 align:start position:0%
in control of the medicine that we're
 
06:02:15.350 --> 06:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
using lastly and continuing the
 
06:02:16.868 --> 06:02:16.878 align:start position:0%
conversation about the level of
 
06:02:19.548 --> 06:02:19.558 align:start position:0%
expectations for consistency of products
 
06:02:21.390 --> 06:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
a reminder that medical patients will
 
06:02:23.030 --> 06:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
still have access to medical
 
06:02:25.110 --> 06:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
dispensaries and indoor cultivated
 
06:02:27.150 --> 06:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
products if they choose that or if they
 
06:02:27.160 --> 06:02:27.990 align:start position:0%
products if they choose that or if they
want

06:02:27.990 --> 06:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
want
 
06:02:29.750 --> 06:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
extremely consistent products they can
 
06:02:31.510 --> 06:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
also choose to cultivate cannabis
 
06:02:33.190 --> 06:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
indoors in their home to have that
 
06:02:35.788 --> 06:02:35.798 align:start position:0%
consistent profile thank you and I will
 
06:02:39.430 --> 06:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
take any additional questions any
 
06:02:44.030 --> 06:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:53.390 --> 06:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:55.868 --> 06:02:55.878 align:start position:0%
Bennett all right thank you for having
 
06:02:57.390 --> 06:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
me I know it's been a long day for us
 
06:03:00.150 --> 06:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
all but um I will Breeze through this um
 
06:03:02.030 --> 06:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
so my name is Alicia Bennett I am fully
 
06:03:04.468 --> 06:03:04.478 align:start position:0%
supportive of Bill uh 1231 which would
 
06:03:05.670 --> 06:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
permit qualifying patients and
 
06:03:07.510 --> 06:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
designated caregivers to cultivate
 
06:03:10.468 --> 06:03:10.478 align:start position:0%
cannabis for therapeutic use um we've
 
06:03:11.910 --> 06:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of great testimonies in
 
06:03:13.070 --> 06:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
support of this bill today and I think
 
06:03:14.990 --> 06:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
one thing that makes mine unique is that
 
06:03:17.350 --> 06:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
I am a patient of the program and this
 
06:03:18.750 --> 06:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
is something that I've wanted for a long
 
06:03:20.670 --> 06:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
time and if this bill were to pass I do
 
06:03:23.788 --> 06:03:23.798 align:start position:0%
plan on cultivating at home um currently
 
06:03:25.390 --> 06:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
I work as the education supervisor for
 
06:03:27.548 --> 06:03:27.558 align:start position:0%
granite Leaf cannabis however today here
 
06:03:29.868 --> 06:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
speaking as a patient um just to give
 
06:03:30.990 --> 06:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
you some quick background my experience
 
06:03:32.510 --> 06:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
with medical cannabis began when I was a
 
06:03:34.868 --> 06:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
student at Texas A&amp;M University studying
 
06:03:36.430 --> 06:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
horiculture with a focus on medicinal
 
06:03:38.910 --> 06:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
plants and education while I was a
 
06:03:40.548 --> 06:03:40.558 align:start position:0%
student I was battling a rare form of
 
06:03:42.670 --> 06:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
cancer that led to the amputation of my
 
06:03:45.030 --> 06:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
right arm and part of my chest wall
 
06:03:46.788 --> 06:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis was more effecting more
 
06:03:48.830 --> 06:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
effective for treating my severe pain
 
06:03:51.070 --> 06:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
and the side effects of chemotherapy
 
06:03:52.830 --> 06:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
than any of the other medications I had
 
06:03:55.868 --> 06:03:55.878 align:start position:0%
been on um in 2018 when I was finally in
 
06:03:57.628 --> 06:03:57.638 align:start position:0%
remission I moved back to New Hampshire
 
06:03:59.948 --> 06:03:59.958 align:start position:0%
to have access to therapeutic cannabis
 
06:04:00.990 --> 06:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
and I've been on the therapeutic
 
06:04:03.590 --> 06:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis program for over 5 years and in
 
06:04:06.150 --> 06:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
that time I've used it to to manage my
 
06:04:08.590 --> 06:04:08.600 align:start position:0%
chronic pain Phantom limb sensation
 
06:04:12.230 --> 06:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
insomnia nausea PTSD anxiety and
 
06:04:14.310 --> 06:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
depression I believe that this bill will
 
06:04:16.310 --> 06:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
benefit therapeutic canabas patients
 
06:04:18.590 --> 06:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
like me in New Hampshire um I have
 
06:04:19.990 --> 06:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
several other points that other people
 
06:04:21.990 --> 06:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
had brought up already that legalizing
 
06:04:23.708 --> 06:04:23.718 align:start position:0%
home cultivation will help people like
 
06:04:25.868 --> 06:04:25.878 align:start position:0%
me with affordability it will give
 
06:04:28.070 --> 06:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
people that do not have um easy access
 
06:04:30.670 --> 06:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
to dispensaries um more opportunity to
 
06:04:33.548 --> 06:04:33.558 align:start position:0%
grow from home and to not have to travel
 
06:04:36.110 --> 06:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
as far to get access to products and
 
06:04:37.628 --> 06:04:37.638 align:start position:0%
although the dispensaries do offer a
 
06:04:38.948 --> 06:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
wide selection of products there are
 
06:04:40.708 --> 06:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
certain cultivars that work well for
 
06:04:42.628 --> 06:04:42.638 align:start position:0%
certain conditions I know there's a few
 
06:04:44.070 --> 06:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
that work well for me than none of the
 
06:04:45.628 --> 06:04:45.638 align:start position:0%
dispensaries in New Hampshire currently
 
06:04:48.468 --> 06:04:48.478 align:start position:0%
offer um it's kind of like you think of
 
06:04:49.788 --> 06:04:49.798 align:start position:0%
apples there's some apples that I really
 
06:04:51.708 --> 06:04:51.718 align:start position:0%
like you can't always find in the store
 
06:04:54.150 --> 06:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
um and I would grow them at home I'm a
 
06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
very Avid Gardener I love horiculture I
 
06:04:57.868 --> 06:04:57.878 align:start position:0%
love plants and I did of that the point
 
06:05:00.270 --> 06:05:00.280 align:start position:0%
was already brought up that I do
 
06:05:01.750 --> 06:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
actually have a couple of plants that
 
06:05:04.270 --> 06:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
are in my garden and I know that they
 
06:05:05.948 --> 06:05:05.958 align:start position:0%
are deadly and they can be used in
 
06:05:08.990 --> 06:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
certain ways that um could be harmful or
 
06:05:11.270 --> 06:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
kill someone however cannabis has never
 
06:05:13.548 --> 06:05:13.558 align:start position:0%
been reported to um kill anyone and it
 
06:05:15.230 --> 06:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
has so many therapeutic benefits which I
 
06:05:17.830 --> 06:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
think we've all heard enough about today
 
06:05:19.350 --> 06:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
um cannabis is one of my favorite
 
06:05:20.910 --> 06:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
flowers and as a gardener I would really
 
06:05:23.830 --> 06:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
love to grow it at home um this is
 
06:05:25.270 --> 06:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
something that I think can be done
 
06:05:28.030 --> 06:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
safely and responsibly and legalizing
 
06:05:29.670 --> 06:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
hom grow will benefit the therapeutic
 
06:05:31.868 --> 06:05:31.878 align:start position:0%
cannabis patients in New Hampshire thank
 
06:05:33.510 --> 06:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
you for listening and I'm happy to any
 
06:05:37.468 --> 06:05:37.478 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you have thank you
 
06:05:42.670 --> 06:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:45.430 --> 06:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Matt
 
06:05:50.350 --> 06:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:52.868 --> 06:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
cannabis I got it right that time right
 
06:05:55.990 --> 06:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
granite Leaf very
 
06:05:56.000 --> 06:06:11.590 align:start position:0%
granite Leaf very
good

06:06:11.590 --> 06:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:13.590 --> 06:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay again thank you committee for the
 
06:06:16.030 --> 06:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
record Matt Simon Granite Leaf
 
06:06:20.590 --> 06:06:20.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh we support this bill and I
 
06:06:22.190 --> 06:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
will avoid repeating the many excellent
 
06:06:23.948 --> 06:06:23.958 align:start position:0%
points that have been made I agree with
 
06:06:28.468 --> 06:06:28.478 align:start position:0%
them I'll try to say something new um
 
06:06:32.868 --> 06:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
so 10 years ago I and a lot of other
 
06:06:35.468 --> 06:06:35.478 align:start position:0%
folks were in this exact committee we
 
06:06:38.190 --> 06:06:38.200 align:start position:0%
were wearing stickers that said patients
 
06:06:42.270 --> 06:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
not criminals support HB 648 I think it
 
06:06:44.110 --> 06:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
was we had the same stickers made
 
06:06:46.310 --> 06:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
several times for different bills but
 
06:06:49.110 --> 06:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
the slogan patience not criminals was
 
06:06:51.468 --> 06:06:51.478 align:start position:0%
the argument at the time it was a crime
 
06:06:54.430 --> 06:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
to possess or cultivate cannabis and we
 
06:06:56.230 --> 06:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
were arguing that the legislature should
 
06:06:59.110 --> 06:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
make a narrow exception for qualified
 
06:07:02.230 --> 06:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
patients which ended up happening in
 
06:07:05.590 --> 06:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
2013 um I would argue that this bill is
 
06:07:09.548 --> 06:07:09.558 align:start position:0%
consistent with that original sentiment
 
06:07:13.750 --> 06:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
so we are sometimes talking about health
 
06:07:15.510 --> 06:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
care policy when we talk about
 
06:07:17.750 --> 06:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis we're sometimes
 
06:07:20.430 --> 06:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
talking about criminal justice policy
 
06:07:23.310 --> 06:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
and civil liberties and the intersection
 
06:07:26.510 --> 06:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
between those and Health Care policy and
 
06:07:28.270 --> 06:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
I suggest representative Nagel you're
 
06:07:31.150 --> 06:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
far from the first clinician who has uh
 
06:07:33.350 --> 06:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
found some tension and difficulty
 
06:07:35.868 --> 06:07:35.878 align:start position:0%
between those two concepts if we were
 
06:07:38.070 --> 06:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
talking about approving homegrown
 
06:07:40.350 --> 06:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis through the FDA or or some
 
06:07:42.590 --> 06:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
process like that we wouldn't do it for
 
06:07:44.350 --> 06:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
all the reasons that that have been
 
06:07:47.110 --> 06:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
brought up but I would argue we are at
 
06:07:48.948 --> 06:07:48.958 align:start position:0%
the intersection between healthc care
 
06:07:52.230 --> 06:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
policy and uh criminal justice civil
 
06:07:55.150 --> 06:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
liberties policy if patients choose to
 
06:07:56.910 --> 06:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
grow their own and I will tell you that
 
06:07:59.190 --> 06:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
I have known patients who choose to grow
 
06:08:02.990 --> 06:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
their own in New Hampshire since 20078
 
06:08:05.270 --> 06:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
when I started doing this work I know
 
06:08:07.070 --> 06:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
several patients who have moved to other
 
06:08:09.390 --> 06:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
states because they got tired of fearing
 
06:08:12.868 --> 06:08:12.878 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and uh wanted cared so
 
06:08:14.430 --> 06:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
much about this they were willing to
 
06:08:16.788 --> 06:08:16.798 align:start position:0%
move elsewhere that includes my good
 
06:08:18.628 --> 06:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
friend Ted Wright who was a co-sponsor
 
06:08:21.788 --> 06:08:21.798 align:start position:0%
of the bill in 2013 he went on to
 
06:08:24.708 --> 06:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
sponsor this bill several times failed
 
06:08:26.150 --> 06:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
and then moved to Maine out of
 
06:08:26.160 --> 06:08:27.350 align:start position:0%
and then moved to Maine out of
frustration

06:08:27.350 --> 06:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
frustration
 
06:08:30.270 --> 06:08:30.280 align:start position:0%
with our not very Live Free or Die
 
06:08:34.990 --> 06:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
policies um so I would say from the
 
06:08:37.430 --> 06:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
perspective of the at I can't speak for
 
06:08:39.030 --> 06:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
all the atcs I'll speak for our
 
06:08:42.750 --> 06:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
leadership team we all view this as a
 
06:08:44.910 --> 06:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
civil liberties issue we are not looking
 
06:08:47.510 --> 06:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
at this at all as a bottom line issue it
 
06:08:50.430 --> 06:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
is not going to help our bottom line it
 
06:08:53.708 --> 06:08:53.718 align:start position:0%
may hurt it a little bit I'm not sure uh
 
06:08:55.788 --> 06:08:55.798 align:start position:0%
we could sell seedlings and make a
 
06:08:57.590 --> 06:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
little bit of money
 
06:09:00.270 --> 06:09:00.280 align:start position:0%
uh probably the biggest benefit would
 
06:09:02.628 --> 06:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
would be that it would give patients who
 
06:09:05.510 --> 06:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
feel strongly about homow an incentive
 
06:09:08.708 --> 06:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
to register for this program rather than
 
06:09:10.868 --> 06:09:10.878 align:start position:0%
moving to another state or simply
 
06:09:13.430 --> 06:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
growing uh on their own without being a
 
06:09:15.350 --> 06:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
registered patient so I think it would
 
06:09:18.230 --> 06:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
be healthy for the program as a whole uh
 
06:09:20.670 --> 06:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
but the way we look at it you know the
 
06:09:23.708 --> 06:09:23.718 align:start position:0%
way I'm looking at it uh current law is
 
06:09:27.190 --> 06:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
if you manufacture more than 1 ounce of
 
06:09:28.910 --> 06:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
marijuana I say marijuana because I'm
 
06:09:31.510 --> 06:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
referring to 318b the criminal code if
 
06:09:33.030 --> 06:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
you manufacture more than 1 ounce of
 
06:09:35.750 --> 06:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana that is a felony in the state
 
06:09:37.390 --> 06:09:37.400 align:start position:0%
uh if you're familiar with the New
 
06:09:39.590 --> 06:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution part one article
 
06:09:42.548 --> 06:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
18 uh says all penalties ought to be
 
06:09:44.670 --> 06:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
proportioned uh to the nature of the
 
06:09:47.230 --> 06:09:47.240 align:start position:0%
offense in this case the offense is
 
06:09:50.310 --> 06:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
gardening and uh I would argue that it
 
06:09:52.708 --> 06:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
is inappropriate to have a felony
 
06:09:54.830 --> 06:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
penalty associated with cultivating
 
06:09:56.350 --> 06:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis based on everything we've heard
 
06:09:59.548 --> 06:09:59.558 align:start position:0%
today today uh I'll answer one question
 
06:10:02.390 --> 06:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
that came up somebody asked why 12
 
06:10:04.510 --> 06:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
seedlings if you're only able to grow
 
06:10:06.948 --> 06:10:06.958 align:start position:0%
three plants so I think that presumes
 
06:10:09.190 --> 06:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
that somebody's growing from seeds if
 
06:10:11.788 --> 06:10:11.798 align:start position:0%
you buy seeds Okay so you can buy seeds
 
06:10:13.708 --> 06:10:13.718 align:start position:0%
that have been feminized and you have
 
06:10:14.910 --> 06:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
pretty good certainty that they will
 
06:10:17.110 --> 06:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
come up as female plants wrapping up my
 
06:10:19.270 --> 06:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
last Point Mr chairman uh but if the
 
06:10:21.788 --> 06:10:21.798 align:start position:0%
seeds are not feminized they have a 50%
 
06:10:24.350 --> 06:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
chance of being male or female and male
 
06:10:26.830 --> 06:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
plants are not particularly useful for
 
06:10:30.350 --> 06:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
therapeutic purposes so the idea is at
 
06:10:32.070 --> 06:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
least some of your plants will be female
 
06:10:33.190 --> 06:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
and you'll be able to select the
 
06:10:35.510 --> 06:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
seedlings that show female
 
06:10:37.150 --> 06:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
characteristics and grow those as your
 
06:10:38.750 --> 06:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
mature plants while destroying the
 
06:10:43.510 --> 06:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
others happy to take any questions any
 
06:10:46.270 --> 06:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
questions seeing n thank you very much

the hom grow Bill introduced by the
 
06:11:37.708 --> 06:11:37.718 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas the ability to
 
06:11:39.468 --> 06:11:39.478 align:start position:0%
cultivate cannabis for therapeutic
 
06:11:41.670 --> 06:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
purposes is more than just a matter of
 
06:11:44.548 --> 06:11:44.558 align:start position:0%
convenience it's a fundamental aspect of
 
06:11:47.548 --> 06:11:47.558 align:start position:0%
compassionate Health Care as a wellness

chronic health issues and speaking of
 
06:11:58.590 --> 06:11:58.600 align:start position:0%

06:12:15.468 --> 06:12:15.478 align:start position:0%
access to dispensaries can be
 
06:12:17.390 --> 06:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
challenging due to Geographic
 
06:12:20.030 --> 06:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
geographical Financial or physical
 
06:12:22.150 --> 06:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
limitations there are times when my
 
06:12:25.628 --> 06:12:25.638 align:start position:0%
Fibromyalgia symptoms are so severe that
 
06:12:27.830 --> 06:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
driving to a dispensary 1 and a half
 
06:12:30.510 --> 06:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
hours away is simply not
 
06:12:33.030 --> 06:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
feasible home cultivation offers a
 
06:12:35.910 --> 06:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
viable alternative ensuring that such
 
06:12:37.948 --> 06:12:37.958 align:start position:0%
individuals such as myself have
 
06:12:41.390 --> 06:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
uninterrupted access to this medication
 
06:12:43.628 --> 06:12:43.638 align:start position:0%
cannabis cultivation at home empowers
 
06:12:46.190 --> 06:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
patients and caregivers to have greater
 
06:12:48.548 --> 06:12:48.558 align:start position:0%
control over their treatment it allows
 
06:12:50.390 --> 06:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
for the customization of cannabis
 
06:12:52.868 --> 06:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
strains to suit specific medical needs
 
06:12:55.548 --> 06:12:55.558 align:start position:0%
potency and personal preferences which
 
06:12:57.830 --> 06:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
is often not possible with limited
 
06:13:00.270 --> 06:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
dispensary selections this tailored
 
06:13:02.110 --> 06:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
approach can lead to a more effective
 
06:13:04.670 --> 06:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
symptom management and an overall better
 
06:13:07.070 --> 06:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
quality of life moreover home
 
06:13:09.628 --> 06:13:09.638 align:start position:0%
cultivation can be a more costeffective
 
06:13:13.030 --> 06:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
solutions for those who cannot afford it
 
06:13:14.670 --> 06:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
the cost associated with purchasing
 
06:13:16.430 --> 06:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis from dispensaries can be
 
06:13:19.030 --> 06:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
prohibitive to some I met I personally
 
06:13:21.830 --> 06:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
met many patients who just simply cannot
 
06:13:23.788 --> 06:13:23.798 align:start position:0%
afford to purchase enough cannabis from
 
06:13:26.590 --> 06:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
dispensaries for themselves um and
 
06:13:28.830 --> 06:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
allowing at home can significant reduce
 
06:13:30.948 --> 06:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
this financial strain for these
 
06:13:35.030 --> 06:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
individuals um so as a as uh others
 
06:13:36.830 --> 06:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it makes it affordable it
 
06:13:39.070 --> 06:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
makes it easier uh to access this
 
06:13:41.708 --> 06:13:41.718 align:start position:0%
medication and also I just want to add a
 
06:13:44.310 --> 06:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
personal note as well that as a USDA
 
06:13:46.990 --> 06:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
licensed hemp grower when I received my
 
06:13:49.510 --> 06:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
license I contacted our local police
 
06:13:51.390 --> 06:13:51.400 align:start position:0%
department to let them know that I have
 
06:13:53.750 --> 06:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
a license to grow a hemp and I told them
 
06:13:55.708 --> 06:13:55.718 align:start position:0%
where I'm going to grow it maybe
 
06:13:58.430 --> 06:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis hom Growers could
 
06:14:00.270 --> 06:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
possibly do the same so that local
 
06:14:02.430 --> 06:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
police knows who legally grows under
 
06:14:05.510 --> 06:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
their jurisdiction in conclusion I urge
 
06:14:07.830 --> 06:14:07.840 align:start position:0%

06:14:11.270 --> 06:14:11.280 align:start position:0%

activity you're providing relief

individuals who depend on therapeutic
 
06:14:22.708 --> 06:14:22.718 align:start position:0%
cannabis for their well-being and health
 
06:14:24.030 --> 06:14:24.040 align:start position:0%

you
 
06:14:41.510 --> 06:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
chair 15 seconds to to retract a
 
06:14:43.110 --> 06:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
statement I made that was an error in my
 
06:14:45.350 --> 06:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier it only Tak 15 seconds
 
06:14:47.990 --> 06:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to time you 15 seconds I
 
06:14:48.990 --> 06:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
think those of you who know me know that
 
06:14:50.310 --> 06:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
I don't like making errors and I sure
 
06:14:51.350 --> 06:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
don't want it to be out there when I
 
06:14:53.990 --> 06:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
made it when tcob reviewed this bill we
 
06:14:56.590 --> 06:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
reviewed the LSR version um I objection
 
06:14:58.270 --> 06:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
to the bill which was stated in the
 
06:14:59.788 --> 06:14:59.798 align:start position:0%
second page of my testimony about page
 
06:15:02.708 --> 06:15:02.718 align:start position:0%
five lines 13 to 18 that is no longer it
 
06:15:05.030 --> 06:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
does not have to do with cultivation so
 
06:15:06.750 --> 06:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
what I said was incorrect and I just
 
06:15:08.390 --> 06:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to retract that thank you okay
 
06:15:11.910 --> 06:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you exactly 15 seconds wow he's
 
06:15:15.190 --> 06:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
got an innate sense of timing
 
06:15:19.230 --> 06:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:21.788 --> 06:15:21.798 align:start position:0%

Stockwell
 
06:15:29.868 --> 06:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
from rad New
 
06:15:32.548 --> 06:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all right is this on this time
 
06:15:34.948 --> 06:15:34.958 align:start position:0%
somebody left it on for me thank you yep
 
06:15:37.030 --> 06:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
on uh thanks so much for for hearing
 
06:15:39.510 --> 06:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
from me I I do think that uh most of the
 
06:15:41.948 --> 06:15:41.958 align:start position:0%
people that have spoken already have
 
06:15:44.230 --> 06:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
have spoken uh about a lot of the things
 
06:15:46.310 --> 06:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
that I was uh thinking about saying but
 
06:15:49.270 --> 06:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
I really I I've heard a lot from atc's
 
06:15:52.030 --> 06:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
and um or from that sort of perspective
 
06:15:55.788 --> 06:15:55.798 align:start position:0%
if you will and I um I'm really here
 
06:15:58.310 --> 06:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
about the caregiver perspective my my
 
06:16:01.468 --> 06:16:01.478 align:start position:0%
husband uh is a licensed caregiver in
 
06:16:05.270 --> 06:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
the state he's also a USDA hemp licens
 
06:16:09.110 --> 06:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
grower um in the state and
 
06:16:12.510 --> 06:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
um we've testified about uh this many
 
06:16:15.430 --> 06:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
times in the past I fully support this
 
06:16:18.430 --> 06:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
bill um I'd like to see anyone uh be
 
06:16:21.990 --> 06:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
able to grow their own not not just
 
06:16:24.628 --> 06:16:24.638 align:start position:0%
caregivers um I think this is really
 
06:16:26.468 --> 06:16:26.478 align:start position:0%
reasonable and one of the the things
 
06:16:28.430 --> 06:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
that uh Matt Simon said before is about
 
06:16:30.030 --> 06:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
the different policies in different
 
06:16:31.270 --> 06:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
states and that's something that I've
 
06:16:34.548 --> 06:16:34.558 align:start position:0%
been really looking at um because I also
 
06:16:36.510 --> 06:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
have a Horticultural background I've
 
06:16:38.190 --> 06:16:38.200 align:start position:0%
worked for organic farms and I'm
 
06:16:40.910 --> 06:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
currently uh I currently grow um house
 
06:16:42.948 --> 06:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
plants uh in my house and hope to
 
06:16:45.750 --> 06:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
someday in maybe my retirement uh have
 
06:16:48.910 --> 06:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
some sort of greenhouse business um it
 
06:16:51.948 --> 06:16:51.958 align:start position:0%
is very therapeutic for me there's also
 
06:16:53.590 --> 06:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
other qualities about growing indoor
 
06:16:55.548 --> 06:16:55.558 align:start position:0%
plants where your air quality is better
 
06:16:59.788 --> 06:16:59.798 align:start position:0%
Etc Etc um some of those differences um
 
06:17:01.788 --> 06:17:01.798 align:start position:0%
for instance Massachusetts if you are a
 
06:17:01.798 --> 06:17:03.190 align:start position:0%
for instance Massachusetts if you are a
licensed

06:17:03.190 --> 06:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
06:17:05.830 --> 06:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
caregiver their policy is that you can
 
06:17:09.510 --> 06:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
maintain a 60-day supply for each
 
06:17:12.948 --> 06:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
patient it does not mention uh seedlings
 
06:17:16.190 --> 06:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
in the in the web page that I was on um
 
06:17:18.270 --> 06:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
and maybe that's because those seedlings
 
06:17:20.910 --> 06:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
aren't not counted on some level because
 
06:17:25.310 --> 06:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
they are considered hemp um and in Maine
 
06:17:28.390 --> 06:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
also another bordering state uh one that
 
06:17:31.270 --> 06:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
we have considered moving to as we were
 
06:17:34.190 --> 06:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
also hearing people testify about and
 
06:17:36.390 --> 06:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
I've lived here for over 50 years I want
 
06:17:41.070 --> 06:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
to make that clear um you can grow 30
 
06:17:44.868 --> 06:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
mature plants 60 immature and there's no
 
06:17:48.468 --> 06:17:48.478 align:start position:0%
limit on seedlings so we're we're asking
 
06:17:51.310 --> 06:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
for a very small amount here I would I
 
06:17:52.910 --> 06:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
think nationally the average is probably
 
06:17:57.230 --> 06:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
around 12 uh this is super super
 
06:18:00.350 --> 06:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable I um I'd like to see
 
06:18:02.670 --> 06:18:02.680 align:start position:0%
something a little bit different but I I
 
06:18:04.230 --> 06:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
think this is a great
 
06:18:07.830 --> 06:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
start see how it goes I I really I
 
06:18:10.670 --> 06:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
sympathize with what the state police
 
06:18:13.628 --> 06:18:13.638 align:start position:0%
said but on some but I on another level
 
06:18:16.150 --> 06:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
I I understand that there are Provisions
 
06:18:18.628 --> 06:18:18.638 align:start position:0%
that allow them to
 
06:18:21.510 --> 06:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
check uh so I don't I feel like that's
 
06:18:24.070 --> 06:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
kind of a non-issue and another grower
 
06:18:26.430 --> 06:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
just testified that they reached out to
 
06:18:29.350 --> 06:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
their local law enforcement to tell them
 
06:18:31.708 --> 06:18:31.718 align:start position:0%
not everybody wants to do that maybe
 
06:18:32.910 --> 06:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
because they know how their law
 
06:18:36.910 --> 06:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement might respond to that call
 
06:18:39.390 --> 06:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
uh so or they might be targeted in other
 
06:18:42.230 --> 06:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
ways so I I think that's up to
 
06:18:48.310 --> 06:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:51.948 --> 06:18:51.958 align:start position:0%
um please start wrapping up okay uh yeah
 
06:18:53.750 --> 06:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
I I I I
 
06:18:56.910 --> 06:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
guess that that's maybe really it I just
 
06:18:58.788 --> 06:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
I think this is so reasonable that it
 
06:19:01.548 --> 06:19:01.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like a really big lift uh
 
06:19:04.150 --> 06:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
for the committee to to support this
 
06:19:07.270 --> 06:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
bill um wholeheartedly I think there's
 
06:19:09.350 --> 06:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of structure around it
 
06:19:12.190 --> 06:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
for patients uh and their caregivers I
 
06:19:14.390 --> 06:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
just for me it's really about economic
 
06:19:18.868 --> 06:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
freedom also um I am I I know I talk to
 
06:19:20.310 --> 06:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
people about their Healthcare all the
 
06:19:23.948 --> 06:19:23.958 align:start position:0%
time and uh a lot of people can't even
 
06:19:25.830 --> 06:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
afford their health care let alone Be
 
06:19:28.628 --> 06:19:28.638 align:start position:0%
being able to go to an ATC and afford
 
06:19:30.910 --> 06:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
the prices there so this would allow
 
06:19:33.590 --> 06:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
people to grow this on their own or have
 
06:19:37.150 --> 06:19:37.160 align:start position:0%
their caregiver grow it for them uh for
 
06:19:39.150 --> 06:19:39.160 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe a fee but it would be a very
 
06:19:42.030 --> 06:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
nominal nominal fee to get the medicine
 
06:19:43.430 --> 06:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
they need when it's something that is
 
06:19:45.788 --> 06:19:45.798 align:start position:0%
not supported by our current health care
 
06:19:48.350 --> 06:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
industry or insurance industry thank you
 
06:19:50.830 --> 06:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions hi
 
06:19:53.708 --> 06:19:53.718 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
06:19:56.310 --> 06:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
chair during a
 
06:19:58.150 --> 06:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
testimony you talked about the
 
06:20:00.590 --> 06:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
compensation as far as with patients and
 
06:20:04.750 --> 06:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
caregivers if I look at page two yes yes
 
06:20:09.270 --> 06:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
I read that line 26 27
 
06:20:12.190 --> 06:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
mm it says not to exceed $500 per
 
06:20:15.430 --> 06:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
calendar year is that per patient or is
 
06:20:17.230 --> 06:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
that now I'm trying to get to is that if
 
06:20:18.990 --> 06:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not I'm not sure because I
 
06:20:21.510 --> 06:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
didn't write this bill so um so the way
 
06:20:23.310 --> 06:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
I read it we could possibly have
 
06:20:25.750 --> 06:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
somebody taking care of 10 patients no
 
06:20:27.788 --> 06:20:27.798 align:start position:0%
no no no our state and actually
 
06:20:29.830 --> 06:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Maine and and New
 
06:20:31.990 --> 06:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is is five five patients for a
 
06:20:35.030 --> 06:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
caregiver where does it say that uh it
 
06:20:37.110 --> 06:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
is where it says
 
06:20:42.670 --> 06:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:46.548 --> 06:20:46.558 align:start position:0%
page uh 11 line 11 has agrees not to
 
06:20:48.750 --> 06:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
exceed five qualifying patients in the
 
06:20:51.230 --> 06:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use of cannabis unless you
 
06:20:54.510 --> 06:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
live more than 50 miles away from an ATC
 
06:20:57.430 --> 06:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
or the car or the patient so if I'm in
 
06:20:58.670 --> 06:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
North Country if I understand this
 
06:21:01.310 --> 06:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
correctly I'm more than 50 Mi away that
 
06:21:01.320 --> 06:21:03.350 align:start position:0%
correctly I'm more than 50 Mi away that
doesn't

06:21:03.350 --> 06:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
06:21:05.548 --> 06:21:05.558 align:start position:0%
apply what what are you saying doesn't
 
06:21:09.110 --> 06:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
apply if I'm more than 50 miles away
 
06:21:11.110 --> 06:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
then if you're are you a caregiver yes
 
06:21:13.350 --> 06:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
or a patient you can have nine patients
 
06:21:15.150 --> 06:21:15.160 align:start position:0%
if you are more than 50 miles away and
 
06:21:18.830 --> 06:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
your patients are thank you um you know
 
06:21:20.990 --> 06:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
I I think there are some things that
 
06:21:22.990 --> 06:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
could be clearer I'm I'm a little bit
 
06:21:26.868 --> 06:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
unclear about um some of the wording too
 
06:21:26.878 --> 06:21:28.310 align:start position:0%
unclear about um some of the wording too
so

06:21:28.310 --> 06:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:21:32.110 --> 06:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm happy to yeah go for it
 
06:21:32.120 --> 06:21:33.468 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm happy to yeah go for it
representative

06:21:33.468 --> 06:21:33.478 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:21:35.430 --> 06:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
kosman thank you Mr chairman for
 
06:21:37.270 --> 06:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
indulging me um in section nine of the
 
06:21:42.750 --> 06:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
bill it's on page three um if you look
 
06:21:47.990 --> 06:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
at um I on line 21 the designated
 
06:21:51.110 --> 06:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
caregivers cultivation location where he
 
06:21:53.310 --> 06:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
or she may cultivate cannabis on behalf
 
06:21:55.270 --> 06:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
of a single qualifying patient who is
 
06:21:58.390 --> 06:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
not reported a cultivation location so
 
06:21:58.750 --> 06:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
they can
 
06:21:58.760 --> 06:21:59.990 align:start position:0%
they can
[Music]

06:21:59.990 --> 06:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:22:00.000 --> 06:22:03.310 align:start position:0%
[Music]
only

06:22:03.310 --> 06:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:05.990 --> 06:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
um from what it uh from what was said in
 
06:22:07.548 --> 06:22:07.558 align:start position:0%
the testimony earlier I think this is
 
06:22:10.830 --> 06:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
where it's saying that only one um they
 
06:22:13.310 --> 06:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
can only have one
 
06:22:15.390 --> 06:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
patient so they can only grow for one
 
06:22:16.990 --> 06:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
patient is that what you're saying
 
06:22:18.310 --> 06:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
that's what my understanding and I just
 
06:22:20.510 --> 06:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
want to try to get to is that for
 
06:22:21.670 --> 06:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
clarification we heard from law
 
06:22:23.070 --> 06:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement the difficulty in trying to
 
06:22:24.548 --> 06:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
enforce this I want to be sure that we
 
06:22:26.150 --> 06:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
don't add more
 
06:22:27.750 --> 06:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
difficulty to law enforcement to try to
 
06:22:30.948 --> 06:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:34.230 --> 06:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
all other
 
06:22:38.230 --> 06:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
questions great thank you okay thank
 
06:22:40.910 --> 06:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
you no one else has signed up to testify
 
06:22:43.868 --> 06:22:43.878 align:start position:0%
on this bill representative Thomas yeah
 
06:22:46.270 --> 06:22:46.280 align:start position:0%
can I just add two points sure okay
 
06:22:47.830 --> 06:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very quick not as quick as
 
06:22:50.990 --> 06:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
Jerry but um almost as quick um there
 
06:22:52.468 --> 06:22:52.478 align:start position:0%
was there was a question about
 
06:22:54.830 --> 06:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
educational material I am actually going
 
06:22:57.788 --> 06:22:57.798 align:start position:0%
to be working this summer um with uh
 
06:22:59.830 --> 06:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
some growers in Maine and we're going to
 
06:23:02.350 --> 06:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
be videotaping and documenting exactly
 
06:23:04.670 --> 06:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
how to grow from seed or how to get from
 
06:23:07.590 --> 06:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
seed to use so I'm working with somebody
 
06:23:09.750 --> 06:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
who is going we're going to do this for
 
06:23:12.150 --> 06:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
outside growing as well as someone who
 
06:23:14.270 --> 06:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
is going to do this with me for inside
 
06:23:17.310 --> 06:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
growing I would never put forward a bill
 
06:23:19.270 --> 06:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have educational material
 
06:23:21.670 --> 06:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
behind it I'm a tech writer a course
 
06:23:24.548 --> 06:23:24.558 align:start position:0%
developer and an instructional designer
 
06:23:30.070 --> 06:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
so educ is my is Is My Jam um and lastly
 
06:23:31.868 --> 06:23:31.878 align:start position:0%
the the other point that I wanted to add
 
06:23:35.230 --> 06:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
in growing plants you don't just use the
 
06:23:38.590 --> 06:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
bud for the flour um there's a lot of
 
06:23:40.230 --> 06:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
people that will take the leaves and put
 
06:23:41.750 --> 06:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
them in smoothies just like you put
 
06:23:44.070 --> 06:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
spinach leaves in smoothies there's
 
06:23:45.868 --> 06:23:45.878 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of nutrition in the leaves
 
06:23:47.390 --> 06:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
there's there's cannabinoids in the
 
06:23:51.310 --> 06:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
leaves um it's a very beneficial plant
 
06:23:53.310 --> 06:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
06:23:56.110 --> 06:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
you okay with that um I have no one else
 
06:23:57.670 --> 06:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify so I'm going to
 
06:23:59.750 --> 06:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
 
06:24:02.310 --> 06:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
1231 and open the public hearing on
 
06:24:03.868 --> 06:24:03.878 align:start position:0%

11171 which will reestablish the
 
06:25:10.948 --> 06:25:10.958 align:start position:0%
currently existing Commission on
 
06:25:12.390 --> 06:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
environmentally triggered chronic
 
06:25:14.510 --> 06:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
illness this commission has done great
 
06:25:17.230 --> 06:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
work since its Inception and as there
 
06:25:18.788 --> 06:25:18.798 align:start position:0%
remains a need will hopefully be allowed
 
06:25:19.868 --> 06:25:19.878 align:start position:0%
to proceed
 
06:25:21.910 --> 06:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
uninterrupted so that it might continue
 
06:25:24.750 --> 06:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
that work uh though representative Lyon
 
06:25:27.110 --> 06:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
is a member not every uh member here may
 
06:25:29.190 --> 06:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
be familiar with this commission so I've
 
06:25:30.590 --> 06:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
handed out some documents for your
 
06:25:32.670 --> 06:25:32.680 align:start position:0%
review uh which include a copy of the
 
06:25:34.868 --> 06:25:34.878 align:start position:0%
current commission statute created by s
 
06:25:37.910 --> 06:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
sp85 in 2019 the commission's most
 
06:25:39.510 --> 06:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
recent annual
 
06:25:42.510 --> 06:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
report a bit of an overview about the uh
 
06:25:44.430 --> 06:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
the composition charge and scope of the
 
06:25:46.628 --> 06:25:46.638 align:start position:0%
commission and the most recent progress
 
06:25:48.390 --> 06:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
report from
 
06:25:50.830 --> 06:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
DHHS as President Ronald Reagan said in
 
06:25:53.830 --> 06:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
his 1984 State of the Union Address
 
06:25:56.350 --> 06:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
preservation of our environment is not a
 
06:25:58.910 --> 06:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
liberal or conservative challenge it's
 
06:26:01.590 --> 06:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
Common Sense over the years we've
 
06:26:03.230 --> 06:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
learned that when we preserve and
 
06:26:05.670 --> 06:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
protect our environment we protect human
 
06:26:08.150 --> 06:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
health and ecosystems we've also
 
06:26:09.628 --> 06:26:09.638 align:start position:0%
discovered that when we fail to protect
 
06:26:11.990 --> 06:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
our environment we compromise Public
 
06:26:14.110 --> 06:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
Health far too many New Hampshire
 
06:26:16.070 --> 06:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
citizens lives have been altered due to
 
06:26:18.948 --> 06:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
a chronic illness diagnosis known to be
 
06:26:20.708 --> 06:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
associated with environmental triggers
 
06:26:26.628 --> 06:26:26.638 align:start position:0%
like past voc's mtbe arsenic lead radon
 
06:26:28.750 --> 06:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria pesticides and other
 
06:26:30.910 --> 06:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
contaminants citizens are left to seek
 
06:26:33.390 --> 06:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
health care and incur costs for illness
 
06:26:35.150 --> 06:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
is linked to such things as the products
 
06:26:38.468 --> 06:26:38.478 align:start position:0%
they use jobs they do air they breathe

triggered chronic
 
06:27:34.270 --> 06:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
illness it's one of New Hampshire's
 
06:27:36.670 --> 06:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
statutory environmental commissions and
 
06:27:38.628 --> 06:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
though there's some overlap amongst the
 
06:27:40.270 --> 06:27:40.280 align:start position:0%
environmental commissions each has a
 
06:27:42.468 --> 06:27:42.478 align:start position:0%
different and specific Focus um you can
 
06:27:44.390 --> 06:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
see that on page seven of the
 
06:27:46.628 --> 06:27:46.638 align:start position:0%
environmentally triggered disease um and
 
06:27:49.070 --> 06:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
chronic illness commission handout this
 
06:27:51.230 --> 06:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
commission is focused upon broad issues

environmental exposure the systems
 
06:27:55.788 --> 06:27:55.798 align:start position:0%
necessary to identify and address in
 
06:27:58.030 --> 06:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
environmentally triggered disease and
 
06:27:59.990 --> 06:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
the work of the subcommittees within
 
06:28:03.390 --> 06:28:03.400 align:start position:0%
Education data and the kle super fund
 
06:28:05.070 --> 06:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
the environmentally triggered chronic
 
06:28:06.548 --> 06:28:06.558 align:start position:0%
illness commission is focused on
 
06:28:08.070 --> 06:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
conducting environmental health
 
06:28:10.510 --> 06:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
surveillance and improving coordination
 
06:28:13.548 --> 06:28:13.558 align:start position:0%
and collaboration between Dees and
 
06:28:16.868 --> 06:28:16.878 align:start position:0%
DHHS to allow resources efficiently to
 
06:28:18.708 --> 06:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
reduce exposure to environmental
 
06:28:21.430 --> 06:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
contaminant and prevent disease to that
 
06:28:24.468 --> 06:28:24.478 align:start position:0%
end Dees and DHHS have entered into an
 
06:28:26.948 --> 06:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding relative to
 
06:28:29.230 --> 06:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
data sharing and an operating procedure
 
06:28:31.390 --> 06:28:31.400 align:start position:0%
on how data layers can be shared between
 
06:28:33.910 --> 06:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
the two departments to identify linkages
 
06:28:35.750 --> 06:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
between environmental contaminants and
 
06:28:35.760 --> 06:28:36.670 align:start position:0%
between environmental contaminants and
health

06:28:36.670 --> 06:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
health
 
06:28:38.990 --> 06:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
outcomes over time it's hoped that the
 
06:28:41.350 --> 06:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
work of this commission can help lead to
 
06:28:43.190 --> 06:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
widespread public health benefits
 
06:28:45.510 --> 06:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
including improvements in average life
 
06:28:47.350 --> 06:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
expectancy when it was looking for a
 
06:28:49.548 --> 06:28:49.558 align:start position:0%
home a few years back and on the advice
 
06:28:51.628 --> 06:28:51.638 align:start position:0%
of this commission this committee excuse
 
06:28:53.948 --> 06:28:53.958 align:start position:0%
me as to where to put it this uh
 
06:28:56.230 --> 06:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
committee to the Mission took on the
 
06:28:58.868 --> 06:28:58.878 align:start position:0%
task of creating a subcommittee focused
 
06:29:01.948 --> 06:29:01.958 align:start position:0%
upon providing education to clinicians
 
06:29:04.430 --> 06:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the PS exposure of their
 
06:29:06.990 --> 06:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
patients right now that subcommittee uh
 
06:29:09.430 --> 06:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
consists of Dr patali uh the New

patient care going forward the
 
06:29:42.430 --> 06:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
commission still has work to do we' like
 
06:29:44.110 --> 06:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
to further develop recommendations
 
06:29:47.030 --> 06:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
related to core topics surveillance
 
06:29:49.548 --> 06:29:49.558 align:start position:0%
reporting communication and capacity
 
06:29:51.670 --> 06:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
building members of the health and data
 
06:29:53.350 --> 06:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittees have also determined a
 
06:29:55.750 --> 06:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
need to create a New Hampshire ented
 
06:29:58.230 --> 06:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
centered database of environmental
 
06:29:59.868 --> 06:29:59.878 align:start position:0%
threats and environmentally triggered
 
06:30:02.310 --> 06:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
diseases based on the list maintained by
 
06:30:04.948 --> 06:30:04.958 align:start position:0%
the National Institute of Health until
 
06:30:07.990 --> 06:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
2017 that work has just begun thank you
 
06:30:09.110 --> 06:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
for your time attention and
 
06:30:11.990 --> 06:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
consideration of HB 1171 I urge you to
 
06:30:13.990 --> 06:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
vote OTP to support and allow the
 
06:30:15.628 --> 06:30:15.638 align:start position:0%
condition the commission to continue its
 
06:30:19.628 --> 06:30:19.638 align:start position:0%
work thank you thank you any
 
06:30:23.390 --> 06:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative Parmer I when
 
06:30:29.070 --> 06:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
um last week we looked at um HB 1393
 
06:30:31.310 --> 06:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
which is uh looking specifically at
 
06:30:33.670 --> 06:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
pediatric cancers and asking the State
 
06:30:35.548 --> 06:30:35.558 align:start position:0%
Health Improvement plan to look into
 
06:30:39.310 --> 06:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
that as a bill and I'm just wondering if
 
06:30:42.788 --> 06:30:42.798 align:start position:0%
this is a little redundant I mean so
 
06:30:44.350 --> 06:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
that's one part of this the other part
 
06:30:46.510 --> 06:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
was I'm on that commission and at our
 
06:30:48.270 --> 06:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
last meeting I sort of brought up the
 
06:30:49.750 --> 06:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
idea that instead of having to have a
 
06:30:52.468 --> 06:30:52.478 align:start position:0%
bill for that they would just do it but
 
06:30:56.150 --> 06:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if you know have two
 
06:30:57.830 --> 06:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
different commissions looking at the
 
06:30:59.788 --> 06:30:59.798 align:start position:0%
same thing if that makes sense or
 
06:31:00.990 --> 06:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
whether there should be a little more
 
06:31:03.910 --> 06:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
discussion there and and and or at least
 
06:31:06.750 --> 06:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
sharing of the data so neither one has
 
06:31:08.868 --> 06:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
to work as much right thank you for your
 
06:31:11.388 --> 06:31:11.398 align:start position:0%
question um I the commission on
 
06:31:12.868 --> 06:31:12.878 align:start position:0%
environmentally triggered chronic
 
06:31:15.910 --> 06:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
illness um it when I talked about the
 
06:31:18.150 --> 06:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
overlap um on the
 
06:31:20.670 --> 06:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
commissions the difference between this
 
06:31:22.270 --> 06:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
commission and some of the others and I
 
06:31:24.030 --> 06:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
I think like the the PS commission which
 
06:31:27.868 --> 06:31:27.878 align:start position:0%
is hb7 37 and HB 485 which is the SE
 
06:31:30.070 --> 06:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
Coast um uh
 
06:31:32.830 --> 06:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
commission this commission focuses on
 
06:31:36.590 --> 06:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
Broad environmental issues um and on
 
06:31:38.868 --> 06:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
systems um needed to identify and
 
06:31:42.310 --> 06:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
address environmental diseases
 
06:31:45.070 --> 06:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
um talking about the Pediatric cancer I
 
06:31:47.270 --> 06:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
mean that's um it's interesting you
 
06:31:49.590 --> 06:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
bring that up because one of the that
 
06:31:51.070 --> 06:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
the uh a bill that we came before I
 
06:31:53.590 --> 06:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
think it was HB 614 which was passed out
 
06:31:56.430 --> 06:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
of this committee and went to finance uh
 
06:31:59.628 --> 06:31:59.638 align:start position:0%
um excuse me was funded the the uh
 
06:32:02.310 --> 06:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer study in March um those
 
06:32:04.788 --> 06:32:04.798 align:start position:0%
are that recommendation came from this
 
06:32:07.190 --> 06:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
commission um so it's it's widespread
 
06:32:08.750 --> 06:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's not just about cancer it's about
 
06:32:11.990 --> 06:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
natural contaminants it's about um part
 
06:32:13.788 --> 06:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
particulate contaminants in the
 
06:32:16.230 --> 06:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
environment um and it's looking
 
06:32:19.670 --> 06:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
at um you know the whole state it's not
 
06:32:21.628 --> 06:32:21.638 align:start position:0%
particular to like the PFS commission
 
06:32:25.110 --> 06:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
the the the uh HB 737 is particular to
 
06:32:27.708 --> 06:32:27.718 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire and St gobain um
 
06:32:30.990 --> 06:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
so there is some overlap and I I think
 
06:32:33.030 --> 06:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
possibly the the um State Health
 
06:32:35.430 --> 06:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan I mean I think we often
 
06:32:38.310 --> 06:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
have um presentations between
 
06:32:40.070 --> 06:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
commissions so that that information is
 
06:32:41.510 --> 06:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
shared and we don't have to reinvent the
 
06:32:44.628 --> 06:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
wheel on some things um but you know
 
06:32:47.070 --> 06:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
we're we um we have presentations and
 
06:32:49.590 --> 06:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
ongoing collaboration with Dees DHHS
 
06:32:52.788 --> 06:32:52.798 align:start position:0%
they're part of the commission um and
 
06:32:55.030 --> 06:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
when there when there is an overlap um
 
06:32:56.548 --> 06:32:56.558 align:start position:0%
and there's information to to which
 
06:32:59.230 --> 06:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
would benefit any of the commissions we
 
06:33:01.350 --> 06:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
you know we join them or they join us
 
06:33:03.190 --> 06:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
and and um I think it's a it's been a
 
06:33:06.030 --> 06:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
great way to to educate a larger group
 
06:33:08.990 --> 06:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
and and um you know move to to make
 
06:33:12.310 --> 06:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
change where we can thank you sure other
 
06:33:15.030 --> 06:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative Nagel thank you
 
06:33:16.548 --> 06:33:16.558 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
06:33:17.948 --> 06:33:17.958 align:start position:0%
question I just have a question because
 
06:33:19.510 --> 06:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
we were talking about the State Health
 
06:33:22.350 --> 06:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
Initiative assessment commission and one
 
06:33:24.590 --> 06:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
of our big discussions the other day was
 
06:33:26.948 --> 06:33:26.958 align:start position:0%
was well we're developing ideas but how
 
06:33:29.350 --> 06:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
does this actually become real I'm
 
06:33:31.910 --> 06:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
curious like in your your um in this
 
06:33:34.468 --> 06:33:34.478 align:start position:0%
committee Community commission whatever
 
06:33:36.590 --> 06:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
yeah how have you been able to make
 
06:33:38.990 --> 06:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
things become real besides just bringing
 
06:33:41.670 --> 06:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
attention to the problem exists so how
 
06:33:44.230 --> 06:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:46.310 --> 06:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
change one of thank you for that
 
06:33:49.468 --> 06:33:49.478 align:start position:0%
question one of the things we do is um
 
06:33:51.230 --> 06:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
and I think it's in
 
06:33:54.628 --> 06:33:54.638 align:start position:0%
your handout it the charges of
 
06:33:56.910 --> 06:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
commission are identified and I think
 
06:33:56.920 --> 06:33:59.190 align:start position:0%
commission are identified and I think
it's

06:33:59.190 --> 06:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:04.270 --> 06:34:04.280 align:start position:0%
on on this handout it's got a list of um
 
06:34:06.708 --> 06:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
of the charges
 
06:34:18.270 --> 06:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:22.310 --> 06:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
it on part three it talks about um the
 
06:34:25.628 --> 06:34:25.638 align:start position:0%
study that that which to look at but
 
06:34:27.350 --> 06:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
also the things that the commission can
 
06:34:32.350 --> 06:34:32.360 align:start position:0%
do um and those are numbered um
 
06:34:34.510 --> 06:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
and what's listed there is the things
 
06:34:36.868 --> 06:34:36.878 align:start position:0%
that we have done we've worked um with
 
06:34:40.230 --> 06:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh around public uh health
 
06:34:42.190 --> 06:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
education whether it was an issue of
 
06:34:47.510 --> 06:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
pest or lead or um you know those things
 
06:34:48.868 --> 06:34:48.878 align:start position:0%
Health provider Health provider
 
06:34:51.190 --> 06:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
education you know we have so many um
 
06:34:53.910 --> 06:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
health providers that we've seen being
 
06:34:55.628 --> 06:34:55.638 align:start position:0%
in Mar
 
06:34:58.270 --> 06:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
we found that citizens had had more
 
06:34:59.830 --> 06:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the issue than health
 
06:35:02.190 --> 06:35:02.200 align:start position:0%
providers because years ago you know
 
06:35:03.548 --> 06:35:03.558 align:start position:0%
that wasn't environmental medicine
 
06:35:06.628 --> 06:35:06.638 align:start position:0%
wasn't the largest chunk of a a medical
 
06:35:09.948 --> 06:35:09.958 align:start position:0%
education and these are relatively new
 
06:35:12.430 --> 06:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
contaminant so everybody's learning and
 
06:35:16.070 --> 06:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
so um the commission the um subcommittee
 
06:35:20.310 --> 06:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
has worked hard to um educate uh
 
06:35:21.868 --> 06:35:21.878 align:start position:0%
establish networking within New
 
06:35:24.750 --> 06:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association um
 
06:35:27.150 --> 06:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
specialty programs we do presentations
 
06:35:29.670 --> 06:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
at uh be our third year in April the
 
06:35:32.230 --> 06:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
Northern New England nurse practitioners
 
06:35:34.548 --> 06:35:34.558 align:start position:0%
conference um and I think it's been very
 
06:35:35.788 --> 06:35:35.798 align:start position:0%
well received it's been a lot of really
 
06:35:37.590 --> 06:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
good feedback and it and it's alerted us
 
06:35:39.590 --> 06:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
to things that that maybe we should be
 
06:35:42.510 --> 06:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
looking at um so I think there's a lot
 
06:35:46.150 --> 06:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
of um changes that we can make when we
 
06:35:49.510 --> 06:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
know there an a problem exists and in
 
06:35:51.868 --> 06:35:51.878 align:start position:0%
collaboration with Dees and
 
06:35:55.190 --> 06:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
DHHS um we look to you know where we can
 
06:35:57.350 --> 06:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
address them whether it's by legislation
 
06:35:59.750 --> 06:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
or the work of an individual
 
06:36:03.030 --> 06:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um and I I think there's
 
06:36:04.350 --> 06:36:04.360 align:start position:0%
they might actually I don't have it with
 
06:36:07.350 --> 06:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
me but we did have a list of the all of
 
06:36:09.070 --> 06:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
the legislation recommendations for
 
06:36:11.430 --> 06:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
legisl uh legislation that came out of
 
06:36:14.948 --> 06:36:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:18.030 --> 06:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
committee representative Shapero thank
 
06:36:20.190 --> 06:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking
 
06:36:22.430 --> 06:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
this question I know that nationally
 
06:36:24.830 --> 06:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
I've read that nationally there is been
 
06:36:29.310 --> 06:36:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:34.868 --> 06:36:34.878 align:start position:0%
in um lung cancer among young
 
06:36:37.070 --> 06:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
females female
 
06:36:40.310 --> 06:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
non-smokers um and I wonder if that's
 
06:36:45.628 --> 06:36:45.638 align:start position:0%
been identified as um an issue of study
 
06:36:48.230 --> 06:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire through your commission
 
06:36:49.910 --> 06:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question actually
 
06:36:53.548 --> 06:36:53.558 align:start position:0%
it has not but in that same packet um
 
06:36:57.310 --> 06:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
there's a page um says New Hampshire
 
06:36:59.388 --> 06:36:59.398 align:start position:0%
centered index of environmental
 
06:37:02.030 --> 06:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
exposures and that's part of the work
 
06:37:02.948 --> 06:37:02.958 align:start position:0%
that we would like to be able to
 
06:37:06.948 --> 06:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
continue to do um is to identify um
 
06:37:09.468 --> 06:37:09.478 align:start position:0%
areas of Health concern public health
 
06:37:11.670 --> 06:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
concerns and you know we have I just use
 
06:37:13.110 --> 06:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
PS because it's an easy one and and
 
06:37:15.110 --> 06:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
people are really familiar with it um
 
06:37:17.750 --> 06:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
but you know we're looking at PS how how
 
06:37:22.110 --> 06:37:22.120 align:start position:0%
it affects our water um cons Commerce um
 
06:37:24.030 --> 06:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
which parts of the state we know that
 
06:37:25.868 --> 06:37:25.878 align:start position:0%
that that Wells all over New Hampshire
 
06:37:27.830 --> 06:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
are testing positive private Wells are
 
06:37:29.948 --> 06:37:29.958 align:start position:0%
testing positive for pest but certain
 
06:37:31.270 --> 06:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
areas are certainly more impacted
 
06:37:33.150 --> 06:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire um and the Sea
 
06:37:36.350 --> 06:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
Coast um so we're looking at you know
 
06:37:38.468 --> 06:37:38.478 align:start position:0%
making a list right now of what what do
 
06:37:40.548 --> 06:37:40.558 align:start position:0%
we need to focus on um you know are we
 
06:37:43.548 --> 06:37:43.558 align:start position:0%
saying like for example in March we hear
 
06:37:45.270 --> 06:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
anecdotal stories all the time about
 
06:37:48.030 --> 06:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
people say I have this cancer I I can't
 
06:37:50.230 --> 06:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
tell you the number of calls I've got um
 
06:37:53.910 --> 06:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
since the that HB 614 passed which funds
 
06:37:56.070 --> 06:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
the the kidney cancer study people that
 
06:37:58.510 --> 06:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
are living out of the state um and said
 
06:38:00.070 --> 06:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
hey I'm not included in your numbers can
 
06:38:02.948 --> 06:38:02.958 align:start position:0%
you please connect me with DHHS um those
 
06:38:04.628 --> 06:38:04.638 align:start position:0%
kinds of things happen and we hear
 
06:38:06.990 --> 06:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
anecdotal stories from people that say
 
06:38:09.230 --> 06:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
you know I live there not only do I have
 
06:38:10.948 --> 06:38:10.958 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer but I have thyroid
 
06:38:12.628 --> 06:38:12.638 align:start position:0%
disorders that's one of the things that
 
06:38:14.230 --> 06:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
I certainly think needs to be looked
 
06:38:16.190 --> 06:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
into because we're hearing a lot do we
 
06:38:20.150 --> 06:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
have the data no we don't but that's how
 
06:38:22.030 --> 06:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
um you know I think I mentioned before
 
06:38:24.510 --> 06:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
when when I came here before uh about HB
 
06:38:27.628 --> 06:38:27.638 align:start position:0%
614 my goal originally was really for a
 
06:38:30.030 --> 06:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
a a full epidemiological health study
 
06:38:32.430 --> 06:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
for the MARC Community we have about 207
 
06:38:36.868 --> 06:38:36.878 align:start position:0%
28,000 people um and we long believed
 
06:38:40.590 --> 06:38:40.600 align:start position:0%
that we had a higher incidence of cancer
 
06:38:43.150 --> 06:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
and I also think thyroid disorders we
 
06:38:44.830 --> 06:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
have no data there's nobody collecting
 
06:38:47.750 --> 06:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
the data um you know for a number of
 
06:38:49.708 --> 06:38:49.718 align:start position:0%
reasons and that was one of the things
 
06:38:52.150 --> 06:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
that that I IID hoped for recognizing
 
06:38:54.110 --> 06:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
that we finally did see over time in
 
06:38:56.548 --> 06:38:56.558 align:start position:0%
2018 we were told no you're you know the
 
06:38:58.190 --> 06:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
cancer numbers are completely cons
 
06:39:00.388 --> 06:39:00.398 align:start position:0%
consistent with what we would expect and
 
06:39:03.150 --> 06:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
then 5 years later we have what we
 
06:39:05.788 --> 06:39:05.798 align:start position:0%
thought we were saying so um it's things
 
06:39:08.310 --> 06:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
like that that that rise to the top and
 
06:39:10.948 --> 06:39:10.958 align:start position:0%
we're trying to create this index of
 
06:39:14.190 --> 06:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
exposures and health outcomes um to see
 
06:39:16.430 --> 06:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
to sort of help Drive what you know what
 
06:39:18.910 --> 06:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
do what do we need to do that drives
 
06:39:21.070 --> 06:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
legislation it drives
 
06:39:24.708 --> 06:39:24.718 align:start position:0%
education um and so um just some of the
 
06:39:27.230 --> 06:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
goals of the of the of the
 
06:39:30.310 --> 06:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
commission okay other
 
06:39:37.868 --> 06:39:37.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:40.270 --> 06:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
06:39:50.388 --> 06:39:50.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:52.590 --> 06:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
rung thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:39:54.388 --> 06:39:54.398 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
06:39:56.948 --> 06:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
my name is Rosemary rung and I represent
 
06:39:59.110 --> 06:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
M the town of marac Hill Hillsboro
 
06:40:01.548 --> 06:40:01.558 align:start position:0%
District 12 I'm here to speak
 
06:40:05.750 --> 06:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
specifically about one aspect of the
 
06:40:09.628 --> 06:40:09.638 align:start position:0%
hb85 or the the sb85 commission that
 
06:40:12.388 --> 06:40:12.398 align:start position:0%
makes it a very important it's very
 
06:40:14.590 --> 06:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
important to keep that commission going
 
06:40:16.628 --> 06:40:16.638 align:start position:0%
some of you may be aware that over the
 
06:40:19.590 --> 06:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
past few years I've been driving more
 
06:40:22.548 --> 06:40:22.558 align:start position:0%
attention um on cyanobacteria blooms and
 
06:40:26.150 --> 06:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
the risk that they pose to um Granite
 
06:40:29.750 --> 06:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
Staters um back a few years ago uh my
 
06:40:33.910 --> 06:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
bill HB 1066 was passed which mandated
 
06:40:36.110 --> 06:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
that the department of of Environmental
 
06:40:39.910 --> 06:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
Services compile or or um develop a
 
06:40:42.388 --> 06:40:42.398 align:start position:0%
strategic plan to address the growing
 
06:40:44.670 --> 06:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
trend of cyanobacteria blooms in the
 
06:40:47.230 --> 06:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
state they issued that report in
 
06:40:50.270 --> 06:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
November and one of the major components
 
06:40:53.590 --> 06:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
of it is they have to um educate Granite
 
06:40:56.110 --> 06:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
State ERS more about the health threats
 
06:41:00.110 --> 06:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
posed by exposures to blooms and in fact
 
06:41:03.868 --> 06:41:03.878 align:start position:0%
tomorrow at the Senate the the S sp85
 
06:41:05.628 --> 06:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
commission meeting tomorrow afternoon
 
06:41:08.030 --> 06:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
they're having a presentation by Dr
 
06:41:11.030 --> 06:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
Elijah STL who is a neurologist at
 
06:41:12.708 --> 06:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock he's also a
 
06:41:15.510 --> 06:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
neurology professor at the geel school
 
06:41:18.350 --> 06:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
of medicine at Dartmouth and he's been
 
06:41:22.430 --> 06:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
one of the global researchers leading um
 
06:41:25.388 --> 06:41:25.398 align:start position:0%
research on the connection between
 
06:41:28.270 --> 06:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
cyanotoxins specifically a a chemical
 
06:41:31.590 --> 06:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
called bmaa which is beta methyl Amino
 
06:41:36.708 --> 06:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
alanine and its role in um uh um or it's
 
06:41:41.150 --> 06:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
link to uh ALS Alzheimer and and now
 
06:41:45.590 --> 06:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
Parkinson's disease so it's for my
 
06:41:48.590 --> 06:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
corner of the cyano bacteria issue
 
06:41:51.388 --> 06:41:51.398 align:start position:0%
education is extremely important and the
 
06:41:54.350 --> 06:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
role that Senate bill
 
06:41:58.910 --> 06:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
HB s sp85 commission plays in gathering
 
06:42:01.070 --> 06:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
that information not only to educate
 
06:42:03.070 --> 06:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
them and their membership but also to be
 
06:42:05.110 --> 06:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
a conduit to how do we educate the
 
06:42:08.510 --> 06:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
public on exposure risks is really
 
06:42:10.830 --> 06:42:10.840 align:start position:0%
critical um it's going to be critical to
 
06:42:13.230 --> 06:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
the the success of this plan to drive
 
06:42:16.070 --> 06:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
that education component but we need a
 
06:42:18.510 --> 06:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
group like the commission to be able to
 
06:42:21.990 --> 06:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
identify experts that can put everything
 
06:42:25.070 --> 06:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
in context um as far as the risk and
 
06:42:29.510 --> 06:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
exposure goes and also to work with Dees
 
06:42:31.788 --> 06:42:31.798 align:start position:0%
and DHHS
 
06:42:35.510 --> 06:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
on delivering this information um so I
 
06:42:39.990 --> 06:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
do urge you uh to pass on HB 1171 so
 
06:42:42.510 --> 06:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
that this commission can continue its
 
06:42:46.070 --> 06:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
work but um importantly to me to
 
06:42:47.750 --> 06:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
continue the work in
 
06:42:50.110 --> 06:42:50.120 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria so I would be happy to
 
06:42:52.548 --> 06:42:52.558 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you have thank you
 
06:42:55.868 --> 06:42:55.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:00.230 --> 06:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:03.388 --> 06:43:03.398 align:start position:0%
you and guess who's next representative
 
06:43:04.830 --> 06:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas and you said you weren't
 
06:43:10.548 --> 06:43:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:14.670 --> 06:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
today yes I apologize um I am here again
 
06:43:18.110 --> 06:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
like a bad Penny uh Wendy Thomas town of
 
06:43:21.670 --> 06:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
marac um as you know I live in in the
 
06:43:24.230 --> 06:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
town of marac and it is completely
 
06:43:27.670 --> 06:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
contaminated with past chemicals as you
 
06:43:29.830 --> 06:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
likely remember following the discovery
 
06:43:32.708 --> 06:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
of a 42% higher rate of kidney and renal
 
06:43:35.548 --> 06:43:35.558 align:start position:0%
pelvis cancers in the town of March as
 
06:43:37.868 --> 06:43:37.878 align:start position:0%
compared to other uh New Hampshire
 
06:43:41.070 --> 06:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
communities DHHS determined that a phase
 
06:43:43.468 --> 06:43:43.478 align:start position:0%
3 kidney cancer feasibility study was
 
06:43:46.750 --> 06:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate and necessary marac is home
 
06:43:51.310 --> 06:43:51.320 align:start position:0%
to St goane boo a well-known industrial
 
06:43:54.548 --> 06:43:54.558 align:start position:0%
polluter a heavily p contaminated
 
06:43:56.868 --> 06:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
community and has been identified by a
 
06:44:00.388 --> 06:44:00.398 align:start position:0%
former Dees assistant commissioner or
 
06:44:03.230 --> 06:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
has been identified as um as the site of
 
06:44:06.670 --> 06:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
the largest industrial uh environmental
 
06:44:08.990 --> 06:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
industrial disaster in New Hampshire's
 
06:44:11.270 --> 06:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
history we know that cancer can be
 
06:44:13.750 --> 06:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
environmentally triggered uh chronic
 
06:44:16.270 --> 06:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
illness and that kidney cancer is linked
 
06:44:18.190 --> 06:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
to pasas and that
 
06:44:20.868 --> 06:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
peoa to which the marac community has
 
06:44:23.310 --> 06:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
great exposure causes cancer this was
 
06:44:25.510 --> 06:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
just determined recently by a
 
06:44:27.150 --> 06:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of the
 
06:44:29.910 --> 06:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
wh a contract between Dartmouth College
 
06:44:33.628 --> 06:44:33.638 align:start position:0%
and NHD uh DHHS was recently approved by
 
06:44:36.110 --> 06:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council and it allows
 
06:44:37.788 --> 06:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
this important health study to move
 
06:44:40.468 --> 06:44:40.478 align:start position:0%
forward the recommendation for the marac
 
06:44:42.868 --> 06:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer investigation came from
 
06:44:42.878 --> 06:44:44.310 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer investigation came from
this

06:44:44.310 --> 06:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:44:46.910 --> 06:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
commission personally my Dartmouth
 
06:44:49.350 --> 06:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock oncologists believe so
 
06:44:52.310 --> 06:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
strongly that past chemicals caused my
 
06:44:55.830 --> 06:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
cancer I bre cancer that they have coded
 
06:44:58.030 --> 06:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
my cancer as being environmentally
 
06:45:00.230 --> 06:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
triggered by environmental
 
06:45:03.548 --> 06:45:03.558 align:start position:0%
toxins um there is no code for PS
 
06:45:05.750 --> 06:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
poisoning right now so that's the best
 
06:45:08.670 --> 06:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
they can do uh this important commission
 
06:45:12.628 --> 06:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
which will be extended by HB uh 1171
 
06:45:14.670 --> 06:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
looks at the relationship between
 
06:45:16.750 --> 06:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
pollutants and the health impacts that
 
06:45:19.990 --> 06:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
they uh Health impacts they are known or
 
06:45:22.990 --> 06:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
suspected to cause this this very
 
06:45:25.150 --> 06:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
important commission should continue
 
06:45:27.548 --> 06:45:27.558 align:start position:0%
doing its very good
 
06:45:31.510 --> 06:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
work thank you any
 
06:45:34.430 --> 06:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
questions see no questions thank
 
06:45:40.310 --> 06:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:42.388 --> 06:45:42.398 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you for indulging me I
 
06:45:44.388 --> 06:45:44.398 align:start position:0%
noticed a couple of edits that probably
 
06:45:47.150 --> 06:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
should made should be
 
06:45:49.430 --> 06:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
made on page
 
06:45:54.230 --> 06:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
two um of the the uh
 
06:45:57.310 --> 06:45:57.320 align:start position:0%
of the original bill it's are we talking
 
06:45:59.948 --> 06:45:59.958 align:start position:0%
about sb85 yeah sb85 yep and just
 
06:46:03.110 --> 06:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
because the 1171 just reestablished it
 
06:46:05.628 --> 06:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
just extends the end date but two a
 
06:46:07.830 --> 06:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
couple of things have changed um just in
 
06:46:10.750 --> 06:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
our in our last session um on page two
 
06:46:12.590 --> 06:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
we could should we should delete number
 
06:46:16.150 --> 06:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
11 because it references a pilot study
 
06:46:18.910 --> 06:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
program uh that's that is has ended so
 
06:46:21.230 --> 06:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
if we could just delete number
 
06:46:23.910 --> 06:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
11 the one that says reviewing result El
 
06:46:29.670 --> 06:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
say yes and then on page
 
06:46:33.270 --> 06:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
three um again uh a reporting
 
06:46:37.388 --> 06:46:37.398 align:start position:0%
requirement has changed for DHHS so on
 
06:46:40.150 --> 06:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
let's see on Roman numeral 3 where it
 
06:46:42.270 --> 06:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
says on on the bottom honor before
 
06:46:44.430 --> 06:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
September 1st 2019 and at a minimum
 
06:46:46.388 --> 06:46:46.398 align:start position:0%
every six months it should be changed to
 
06:46:48.350 --> 06:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
every 12
 
06:46:52.270 --> 06:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
months page three is said yes under
 
06:46:54.468 --> 06:46:54.478 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 3
 
06:47:00.830 --> 06:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:06.910 --> 06:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:10.150 --> 06:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
much wait one right
 
06:47:14.030 --> 06:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
here yeah so the whole L the whole
 
06:47:16.110 --> 06:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
section no I'll change that every 12
 
06:47:21.430 --> 06:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:24.230 --> 06:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
months okay uh no one else has signed up
 
06:47:28.070 --> 06:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
to testify on HB
 
06:47:30.910 --> 06:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
1171 um and that is all that we have
 
06:47:34.350 --> 06:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
noticed for today so with that um I'm
 
06:47:36.150 --> 06:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
going to declare adjournment and we will
 
06:47:39.628 --> 06:47:39.638 align:start position:0%
meet again next week uh next um the 25th
 
06:47:41.670 --> 06:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
right yeah yes we'll be reconvening on
 
06:47:52.230 --> 06:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:52.240 --> 06:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
evening
