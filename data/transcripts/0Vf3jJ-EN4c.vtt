00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
on page 41 and I'm hoping that people
 
00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
from the oplc are here in particular Mr
 
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 align:start position:0%

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.149 align:start position:0%

speak

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
okay I would like to start by going over
 
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
my comments my take on the
 
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
vill uh and uh then invite others either
 
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
to interrupt as appropriate or to then
 
00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
uh chime in after I've uh as after I
 
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
finished or as I proceed this is uh
 
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh I want to accomplish things I'm not
 
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
too concerned about the formalities of
 
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
things I'm going to say initially uh to
 
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
Mr Brad and to Mr uh Porter that I
 
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
thought going into this that this would
 
00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
be just going over it technically and I
 
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
think there's more to it than that it
 
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 align:start position:0%
maybe my experience speaking but the
 
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
fact is experienced or not I have to
 
00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
make a judgment I'm going I ask you to
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
help me with that judgment or to make
 
00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 align:start position:0%
the appropriate
 
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
changes think I because at this time I
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
see a lot of trees but I don't have a
 
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
cohesive Forest yet I'll tell you the
 
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
principal issue that I have there are
 
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
two uh things issues that sort of
 
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
occurred to me before but as I read
 
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
during the hearing um I'll develop them
 
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.309 align:start position:0%
during the hearing um I'll develop them
now

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
first it
 
00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
appears that the policy has been changed
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
that the oplc is going to conduct the
 
00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
investigation in the past it was in
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
collaboration in cons consultation with
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
the board in the past I believe or in
 
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
the present not changed yet it is the
 
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
board that conducts the entire
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
process uh now that uh if that's true
 
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
and if we adopt that policy there is the
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
there is an intended problem and that
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
problem is
 
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
that boards presently have if I have
 
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
this understanding correct the boards
 
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
presently have this investigative power
 
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
nowhere is that repealed so you're going
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
to have two people or the legis the law
 
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
will reflect two people having the
 
00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
investigative Authority different
 
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
different representative McGuire is uh
 
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:56.749 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
here I was just agreeing with representa
 
00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:01.710 align:start position:0%
here I was just agreeing with representa
kitech

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
kitech
 
00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
that the first thing I thought of when I
 
00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
went through this section was there
 
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
ought to be a whole bunch of
 
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
repeals so that we don't have
 
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.029 align:start position:0%
repeals so that we don't have
conflicting

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
conflicting
 
00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:14.510 align:start position:0%
conflicting

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
so um the boards to this gets a little
 
00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:15.879 align:start position:0%
bit to your your first part of the
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
question about that um who's conducting
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
the investigation a lot of our boards
 
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
previously um used to work with a
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
division of the um AG's office called
 
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
the administrative prosecutions unit not
 
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
all of our boards would um I think it
 
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
was 10 or 12 did and the boards those
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
boards that worked with them would send
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
cases the board would decide uh whether
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
to investigate a matter they'd send the
 
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
case to Apu to to
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
investigate um AP would drop a report
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
and send it back to the board and they
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
would um and then the board would make
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
the decision on whether it needs further
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
investigation whether to um move forward
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
with discipline or whether to send a
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
letter of concern the decision was all
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
up to the
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
boards uh Michael Porter is in the
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement unit of the oplc which um is
 
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.240 align:start position:0%
taking on that role so the
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
administration administrative
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
prosecutions unit at the AGS is um I
 
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
believe uh they're they're not going to
 
00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:22.519 align:start position:0%
be working with the boards anymore and
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
so our enforcement unit is and they are
 
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
going to be doing essentially the same
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
thing but supporting all of our boards
 
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
rather than only those 10 um I think
 
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
Mike can U Mr Porter can give a lot more
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
detail there but that's sort of the
 
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
grand so Mr Porter sort of subc is a
 
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
subcontractor for the Attorney
 
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
General handling
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
enforcement do you want me to explain
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
please yes yes okay so so I I am so we
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
no we I'm going to go back a little bit
 
00:09:59.470 --> 00:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
here we are not subcontract contractors
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
oplc that was image that wasn't
 
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.630 align:start position:0%
oplc that was image that wasn't
reality

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
reality
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
oh all right um so what I want to
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
explain is
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
um what we our our function is to ass
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
assist the boards okay so for example
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll use board of psychology Board
 
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
of mental health uh real estate
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
appraisers um they have I believe board
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
of psychology Board of mental health
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
have subcommittees which are they're the
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
investigative unit for those particular
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
boards the real estate appraiser board
 
00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
uses a recused board member for those
 
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
investigations as well um but there are
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
other boards such as Board of Nursing
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
Real Estate Commission and and many
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
others who want want us as investigators
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
to conduct the investigations draft the
 
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
ROI and then what we do is we then bring
 
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
that to a recused board board member for
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
final review and then that board member
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
brings the information to uh the full
 
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
board to determine whether the matter
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
should be dismissed a letter of concern
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
or go forward for Pro for administrative
 
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
prosecution so we are not removing
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
investigators from the boards many
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
boards do utilize uh their own board
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
members recused board members as
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
investigators the Dental Board in fact
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
used uses a contract
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
investigator um who is either a dentist
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
or hygienist and I apologize for not
 
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
knowing um and the Board of Medicine
 
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
utilizes the mrsc the medical review
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to conduct their
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
investigations but we are there to
 
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
support them if they need assistance
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
with drafting a subpoena uh maintaining
 
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
you know files assisting with interviews
 
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
um if the board member wishes one of our
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
investigators to accompany them to an
 
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
interview inter uh we do so but at the
 
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
same time we also provide investigative
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh resources to other boards um who want
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
to use our investigators so I hope that
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
clarifies we're not taking any Authority
 
00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:16.519 align:start position:0%
away from any of the board members to to
 
00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
conduct their
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
investigations Mr Porter I think You'
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
said it well let me just see if I've
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
power paraphrase this right sure
 
00:12:29.069 --> 00:12:29.079 align:start position:0%
correctly every board still always has
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
still retains and even under this bill
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
would still retain the authority to
 
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
conduct its own
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
investigations in so for some boards
 
00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
they choose to use opl's enforcement
 
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
which is also investigative I guess
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
division uh support which is you yes and
 
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
then you would report back to the board
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
with your findings and the board would
 
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
decide whether they have enough or need
 
00:12:59.470 --> 00:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
more to proceed is that
 
00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
right that is a great synopsis yes now
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's a thank you the thanks but what
 
00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for is that supported in
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
that's got to be supported in present
 
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.470 align:start position:0%
that's got to be supported in present
statute

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
right so it it is and under 310a with
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
the administrative functions um I can
 
00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:23.079 align:start position:0%
let Tom speak to the the statutes that
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
govern oplc he is far more U okay I'm in
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
danger of belaboring this point at this
 
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
uh I represent yeah I think that in many
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
cases it's not 310a it's the specific
 
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
statute of each board like the
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
psychologists are under 329b colon 22 is
 
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
all about
 
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
investigations that that's correct and
 
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
that is a board uh along with a board of
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
mental health um who have I'll just
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
refer to them as subcommittees um I
 
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
believe the board of psychology has the
 
00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.350 align:start position:0%
believe the board of psychology has the
PCI

00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
PCI
 
00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:01.759 align:start position:0%
um and they
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
conduct they're unique from all the
 
00:14:05.749 --> 00:14:05.759 align:start position:0%
other boards in that they receive
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
allegations first which do not
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
necessarily require a response um if the
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
board then determines that that the
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
allegation Rises to the level of a
 
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
complaint um then there's a required
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
response and all of that information
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
goes through the PCI for board of
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
psychology um and they conduct the
 
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
investigations our would assist with the
 
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
prosecution of the so for the board of
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
psychology um our unit would handle the
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
legal aspect of it um if a case had to
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
be prosecuted our prosecution unit would
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
handle that
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
prosecution okay well Tom I'm very
 
00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:46.839 align:start position:0%
concerned that this section does not say
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
things like that so um it I think to so
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
sorry representative McGuire uh you had
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
specifically mentioned the board of
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
psychologists I believe this is in each
 
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
of our boards but when um when the oplc
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
was created in
 
00:15:08.189 --> 00:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
2015 all oplc all staff that used to be
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
employed directly by the boards were
 
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
transferred to uh under the oplc so if
 
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
you look at 329 B22 this is the board of
 
00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:20.759 align:start position:0%
psychologist statute subsection three
 
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
this is specific to investigations after
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
determining the nature and scope of an
 
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
investigation or hearing the board May
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
employ or retain hearing off officers
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
legal counsel medical advisers um school
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
psychologist advisers or investigators
 
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
through the office of professional Li
 
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.790 align:start position:0%
through the office of professional Li
Insurance

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
Insurance
 
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
certification um so I believe there's
 
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
similar Provisions in each board I need
 
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
to go through through them all but um I
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
hope that answers the question as to the
 
00:15:53.069 --> 00:15:53.079 align:start position:0%
authority the current Authority for oplc
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
to be assisting boards with
 
00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
investigations when they want assistance
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
I understand the bo the oplc can assist
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
but reading this statute it doesn't
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
clearly link to the board's Authority it
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
appears it appears to me and I'm not a
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
lawyer I don't even play one on TV but
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
this sounds like the off the oplc will
 
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
take command of the process from you
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
know opening the mail with a complaint
 
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
in it and you know not not the complaint
 
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
stage when the complaint is going to be
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
investigated the oplc takes over no no
 
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
it well it's not clear it says upon
 
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
written complaint of any
 
00:16:46.749 --> 00:16:46.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
off I'm concerned that we are going to
 
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
have conflicting statutes okay okay uh
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
rep we hog this let representative
 
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.069 align:start position:0%
rep we hog this let representative
Schmid

00:16:57.069 --> 00:16:57.079 align:start position:0%
Schmid
 
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
speak thank thank you very much I had my
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
hand up for a while uh and I'm not sure
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
it's being seen so that's why I spoke up
 
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
after a while so uh what we're
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
discussing what you've been discussing
 
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
up to this point is clearly very
 
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
significant and needs to be worked out
 
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
uh to the satisfaction of the Legal
 
00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
Eagles uh but we uh we um certainly want
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
to participate with our experience but
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
the thing I've been concerned about all
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
along is not this although was not a
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
matter that I disregarded or didn't care
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
about but the the concern I have is with
 
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
regard to the effectiveness of the
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
investigation um from a technical
 
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
standpoint not from a legal standpoint
 
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
uh because uh the oplc can't possibly uh
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
in its enforcement arm have the
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
expertise of all the boards with regard
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
to the the the nuts and bolts of
 
00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
misconduct or bad practice practice or
 
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
whatever uh that it would have in some
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
cases not in others and the boards
 
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
clearly have that expertise um among
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
their personnel uh and so that's what
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
I'm most concerned about is is that we
 
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
not lose somehow in the generalization
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
and the provision of of enforcement uh
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
we not lose the expertise required to
 
00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
determine whether somebody is an
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
effective uh a practitioner of the
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
particular profession or or occupation
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
so that is something that that only the
 
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
boards are likely to have um and so
 
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
that's what I want to bring up at this
 
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
point to make sure that that aspect does
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
not get lost it I don't hear it being
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
disregarded at this point but I don't
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
hear it being clearly enunciated either
 
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
so I want everybody to think about that
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
as well thank you we haven't gotten
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
there yet I I I realized that but I I
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
want to make sure because I can't stay
 
00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:06.039 align:start position:0%
for this whole thing because I have a
 
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.039 align:start position:0%
conflict but I want to make sure that
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
that aspect does not get overlooked um
 
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like the board is
 
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
going to be involved uh but it's C it
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
needs to be enunciated thank you well
 
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
that that's exactly representative
 
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
Schmidt I think we're all talking sort
 
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
of the same thing that I'd like to see a
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
statement in the uh in this rewrite or
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
this update that says the board shall
 
00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
have plenty has shall have Authority or
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
has the
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
right ability to conduct the
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
investigation with the Assistance or may
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
ask the assistance consult with
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
something like that is we we we really
 
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
need to clarify what the boards do and
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
what the um oplc does and Mr Porter had
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
raised his hand earlier
 
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I I'm having trouble I'm
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
having trouble with hands we need a
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
giant not with not standing paragraph
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere yes Mr Porter
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
please thank you and I just wanted to uh
 
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
address something that representative
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
Schmidt did say and and I think and he's
 
00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
right you know um and we are certainly
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
not going to sit here before you and
 
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:25.240 align:start position:0%
tell you that we um are the experts in
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
in 55 different professions and that is
 
00:20:27.919 --> 00:20:28.750 align:start position:0%
in 55 different professions and that is
why

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
it is it is
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
key that the communication with the
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
boards and the investigative arm um are
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
working as a cohesive unit and and I and
 
00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:42.200 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you something I learned
 
00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
recently was uh we had a real estate
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
appraiser meeting uh with the board
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
administrator for that board and um I
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
ended up until about nine o'clock the
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
night before going through all the
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
federal regulations that are in play
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
never mind the state statutes right um
 
00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:00.039 align:start position:0%
and the federal audits that are
 
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
conducted and and the importance of
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
those so um Cas boards such as real
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
estate appraisers uh board of psychology
 
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
Board of Mental Health Board of Medicine
 
00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:14.919 align:start position:0%
um it is vital that our communication
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
remains open and consistent with those
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
those boards or
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittees um because they are the
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
experts in the field and we are here to
 
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
support them and do what is necessary
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
but I also want to talk about when I say
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement we also have a prosecution
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
arm um of that we we have two attorneys
 
00:21:37.149 --> 00:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
currently Prosecuting and um you know
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
that comes down to Simply a matter of
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
statutes but I do want to emphasize we
 
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
have every intention of continuing to if
 
00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
boards wish to do their own
 
00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:48.919 align:start position:0%
investigations we'll be supportive if
 
00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
they wish for us to interview Witnesses
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
on their behalf we're happy to do
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
that uh absolutely I think we're all on
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
the same page in the sense that there
 
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
was no intention as I read it as I or as
 
00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:05.559 align:start position:0%
I hear you of usurping the board's
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
Authority I think you've made that clear
 
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
the problem is I don't know that the law
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
that as WR the bill as written makes
 
00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:16.039 align:start position:0%
that as clear as you have just
 
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
enunciated it and I would like first for
 
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
myself I would like to see this somehow
 
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
Rewritten I don't have the words for it
 
00:22:27.269 --> 00:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
but I want a clearer statement of what
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
you have just said I don't think the the
 
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
bill as written is as explicit or as
 
00:22:38.269 --> 00:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
forthright as you have been just now and
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
I'm GNA I think we've made that point
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to yeah I would strongly agree
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
with with representative citec and I
 
00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:48.430 align:start position:0%
with with representative citec and I
think

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
um Tom you you would you would be the
 
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
right person to to put in
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
a another Clause that they about the the
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
process and how and bet how it relates
 
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
to to the boards and does not usurp the
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
existing statutory of the board because
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
is without a such a change this would be
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
read as being later than the
 
00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
investigatory processes of the boards
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
and therefore would supplant them and it
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like that's what we want
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
to do and Tom does that uh uh Mr BR Tom
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
um thank you um so yes I I'm happy to
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
help draft something like that I I will
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
point out as Mike had said and is
 
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear the intention was not
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
to do that that for instance page 41
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
line line 30 which represented Maguire
 
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
you had pointed out before if you go up
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
two lines before it makes clear that
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
boards have that Authority um page 42
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
lines 30 it says the board May dismiss
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
the complaint not it's not decision made
 
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
by oplc but I'm happy to take a look at
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
this retool it to make that um much more
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
out front I think the the big picture
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
and I it sounds like the committee
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
probably understands this is um uh
 
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
starting to or or there's various issues
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
that that are in all the different
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
practice acts that that
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
um yeah that
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
well I'm not sure exactly how to to to
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
word this like this statute right here
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
or this bill is here um incorporates
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
what is in most board statutes there's a
 
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
few boards that are missing pieces of
 
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
this right now um for instance um the
 
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
large majority of our statutes board
 
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
statutes make clear that investigations
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
while they're ongoing are are
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
confidential and not disclosable under
 
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
91a some board statutes lack that
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
language and um
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
I believe the the correct read of that
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
and read of 91a is that those are still
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
confidential because it's a
 
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
investigation um but someone could
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
challenge that in in court someday and
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
um if we can give that protection to all
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
of our boards investigations um I think
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
that's a benefit and this is this is a
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
way to do that so that's just one
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
example of um a piece that we're trying
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
to get for every board absolutely I take
 
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
that I also recognize that
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
representative goalie and rep and Dr
 
00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
Warner want to speak but let me just
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
throw in that while you said uh you've
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
cited line 30 says that they still have
 
00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
they can dismiss I still I think there's
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
wiggle room there and I'm not content
 
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
with that I think we still need to talk
 
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
about a rewrite but I now want to move
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
to representative goalie
 
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
please did you want to speak
 
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.870 align:start position:0%
please did you want to speak
representative

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
goie yes thank you Mr chair
 
00:26:00.389 --> 00:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
um and on that same topic that you're
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
speaking to on lines 30
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
3132 um I I look at it
 
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
as um when you look at line 31 in in
 
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
consultation with the board the office
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
shall assign an investigator there's no
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
wiggle room there who who shall complete
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
the investigation in accordance with
 
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
rules um maybe it should say may assign
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
an investigator because the board may
 
00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
not want them doing the investigation
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
they may want to handle it on their own
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
um and I just also look at if you look
 
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
at page 42 um line two for the purpose
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
of carrying out investigations the
 
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
executive director is authorized to
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
retain experts conduct inspections on
 
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
places of businesses um to me it's
 
00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.350 align:start position:0%
places of businesses um to me it's
taking

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
taking
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
the uh Authority from the board and
 
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
giving it totally to the executive
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
director to do that investigation the
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
way I read
 
00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
it okay and the only other thing I want
 
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
to bring up is I'm a little uh concerned
 
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
that we haven't heard from any of the
 
00:27:00.909 --> 00:27:00.919 align:start position:0%
boards about this going on and this bill
 
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
coming forward and that's just a little
 
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
concerned that nobody's stepped up to
 
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
even uh speak about it Dr Warner is here
 
00:27:11.789 --> 00:27:11.799 align:start position:0%
representing the Psychiatry board and if
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
she will stop waving psychology board
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
and if she will stop waving her hand we
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
will get around to her representative
 
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
goalie terrific before I rep recognize
 
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh representative War Dr W how about
 
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
something like uh I
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
I'm really interrupting the show here uh
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
the board shall conduct an investigation
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
which may request the assistance of oplc
 
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
I think that is where I'd like to see it
 
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
that's that it stays with the board with
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
the assistance of opy which may Dr
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
Warner you're at that oh thank you very
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
very much I appreciate it um Dr Debbie
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
Warner I serve on the board of
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
psychologists and um I appreciate the
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address this subcommittee
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
um looking at part seven of Senate Bill
 
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
133 um I just in terms of the support
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
that we receive from oplc it is great um
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful wonderful Personnel um they
 
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
just do fabulously all the time for us
 
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
um looking at this this bill this
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
section though I do have concerns that I
 
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
and I they reflect very much the uh
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
concerns of those mentioned already um I
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
just want to say I don't think that many
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
things in this section are needed at
 
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
this instant except perhaps for what
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
attorney brck just mentioned in
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
protecting certain investigations from
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
91a disclosure but the um the oplc is
 
00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:58.070 align:start position:0%
91a disclosure but the um the oplc is
new

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
and the enforcement unit is very new and
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
they've been marvelous with us and we're
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
learning as we go but I I think this
 
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
legislation section may be
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
premature um we're in sort of the beta
 
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:24.919 align:start position:0%
enforcement they're learning as they
 
00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
mental health are very similar because
 
00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559 align:start position:0%
our statutes are almost the same and I
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
just want to say I won't talk long would
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
you please repeat that you broke up
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
along the
 
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
way at least for me oh okay um let me
 
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
connection left withing the oplc efforts
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
and we largely agree it's the question
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
of what the words say that is bothering
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
us not what the oplc is not
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
bothering yes they're
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
new they're they're marvelous um
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
attorney Porter has assisted us in a
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
several ways already in just the several
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
months that he's been with the
 
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
oplc and uh we're
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
developing our methods and of course he
 
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
has to do this with 55 boards I do not
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
envy this uh position that he's in um
 
00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
and I do understand that in some ways
 
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
oplc needs to have
 
00:30:38.509 --> 00:30:38.519 align:start position:0%
some um
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
reproducible um modules of action that
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
will work across the boards I think that
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
this is a good first draft of something
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
to launch from but it's going to take
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
interconnecting with and examining this
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
in light of all of the boards to see how
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
this will work in the long run I think
 
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
that it's premature to bring this
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
forward now in this section I think the
 
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
only things that are particularly needed
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
right now are what attorney brck
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned which is the U protecting
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
investigatory information for certain
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
boards from disclosure on
 
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
91a but there's so much uh going on here
 
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0%
and changing I think that the
 
00:31:31.149 --> 00:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement unit that we have today is
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
going to very different than the one we
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
will have in six months or even 12
 
00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
months and they will have gotten even
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
more brilliant at what they do and it
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
will I think that this is a good beta um
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
template for something that we might
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
consider uh developing for a uniform
 
00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
approach for assisting the boards and
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
that certain boards might be be part of
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
the um we help the training wheels
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
approach and then the other certain
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
boards you're on your own you know go
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
hiking um we that we might have
 
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
different conditions or different
 
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
sections for that I was very concerned
 
00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.430 align:start position:0%
sections for that I was very concerned
reading

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
reading
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
it um in terms very similar to
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire's concerns that
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
this really appears to need to um repeal
 
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
all sorts of sections of
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
our statute and it overrides 22 and
 
00:32:33.789 --> 00:32:33.799 align:start position:0%
various others it seemed um although in
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
talking with attorney Porter I very much
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate your very early morning um
 
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
conversation sleep is something I guess
 
00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
you don't get when you're working in
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
your division um but I I appreciate that
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the the people involved
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
have excellent Good Will toward the
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
boards however reading the Lang language
 
00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't reflect all of the same
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
limitations that you were conveying to
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
us verbally and that you you are
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
portraying and you do in your actions uh
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
it's continuous you're you're not
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
hypocritical you you do what you say and
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
it's very much appreciated but I don't
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
think that's reflected in this language
 
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
and deferring to the board's Authority
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
and deferring to the board's statutes I
 
00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:24.919 align:start position:0%
think really needs to be part of this
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
and so I I would suggest to this
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
committee that this um part of the bill
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
be greatly honed down to just the Bare
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
Essentials that are needed now that the
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement unit continue to rely on
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
standing orders from the boards to do
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
its work as well as uh particular orders
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
I know our board doesn't do many
 
00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
standing orders Debbie thank you it took
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
you quite a while but you got to our
 
00:33:54.909 --> 00:33:54.919 align:start position:0%
Point that's exactly what we're talking
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
about we want right now oplc is not too
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
big for its britches but we don't want
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
the a careless law to let this we don't
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
want our first step to be a careless
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
step we want it to be crafted and I
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
think we can do that and still and
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
address the concern that you've started
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
that you've enunciated we can we can get
 
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
this so that right now we maintain the
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
confidentiality but that the onus the
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
right is explicitly stated that the
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
board has the
 
00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
investigation has complete Authority
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
with the assistance the enthusiastic
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
assistance which they'll probably seek
 
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
from LPA oplc but I want the horse in
 
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
front of the car yes I see I see a hand
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
over there are two of them frck and
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
porer have both raised their hands mean
 
00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
Mr uh I don't know bradrick go
 
00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.109 align:start position:0%
Mr uh I don't know bradrick go
[Music]

00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
ahead unless you actually I I don't have
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
my hand up right now um I have a few
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
things but I can let uh Mr Porter go
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
first keep your hands to yourself for
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
now uh repres Mr
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
reporter oh thank you very much I'm only
 
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
on my first cup of coffee um I I wanted
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
to address uh representative goalie's
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
concern um with regard to that the the
 
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
the sentence that says in consultation
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
with the board the office shall assign
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
an investigator and I won't read the
 
00:35:26.589 --> 00:35:26.599 align:start position:0%
whole thing I I see where the concern is
 
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
and I think when when this was drafted
 
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
and and again words matter um by the by
 
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
the phrase in consultation with the
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
board to me indicates that we've reached
 
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
out to the board they've reached out to
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
us and they've said hey OPC we need
 
00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
assistance um if they ask us for
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
assistance we shall provide that and I
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify um but I do
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
understand representative goalie's
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
concern with that word but I just wanted
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
to give kind of a little bit of input as
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
to what the the intention was so
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
that said would it be fair to say would
 
00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:03.079 align:start position:0%
it be fair to say that that should
 
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
actually read when requested by the
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
board the oplc shall assign an
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
investigator yeah and and that's
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
something I'll definitely tell you know
 
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:15.160 align:start position:0%
Tom and I can talk about offline as we
 
00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
go through this um because we will
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
obviously go through this um for sure so
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
we can definitely Wordsmith that um as
 
00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
far as the prematurity of this um
 
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
and the the reason this is coming
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
forward is because we do have 55
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
different boards that we are working
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
with and um there's a lot in here that
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
really addresses issues that not every
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
board has and I think I mentioned it
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
during my testimony yesterday unlicensed
 
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
practice that's a big problem in this
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
state with well any state actually um
 
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
not every board actually has that and to
 
00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
have the ability to have something like
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
that uh present for each board through
 
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
this rule writing um I think would help
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
curb that that illegal practice um so I
 
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out that one issue
 
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
as well um Mr Porter we haven't gotten
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
there yet that's in the bill and I'm
 
00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:16.599 align:start position:0%
pres I'm gonna Moy along to that in the
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
time I'll stop then thank
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
you yeah I would like to say I don't
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
think it's premature I believe that
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
since we are creating this division of
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
Investigations that we need to have a
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
law that says what they're supposed to
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
be doing and
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
while and I think the first and most
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
important thing is a
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
leadin says you know the boards have the
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility and the technical
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
Authority and the board and OPC is just
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
there to help and that is what is the
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
first thing we've got to have because
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise the boards that have well
 
00:38:01.309 --> 00:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
fleshed out laws and investigative
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
procedures there are some will not be
 
00:38:08.589 --> 00:38:08.599 align:start position:0%
influenced by this but the boards that
 
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
don't have that statutory Authority or
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
don't have a well flesh out procedure
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
division okay uh somebody I think one of
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
you said word smithing I'm going to get
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
to word smithing in a minute but this is
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
may only be a few words but it's fairly
 
00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
sign is more significant than wordsi to
 
00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
me I don't think you meant it any I
 
00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
don't think you meant to minimize it but
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
we're really I we've spent 40 minutes on
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
this point which is probably the most
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
important point of the bill as far as
 
00:38:43.839 --> 00:38:44.630 align:start position:0%
important point of the bill as far as
I'm

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
concerned up okay uh yes Tom were you
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and um I just a couple
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
again bigger things and maybe we'll get
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
to them but um yeah um sorry uh Mr or I
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
think it was you chairman uh that had
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um sorry that the boards
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
that have good processes um we'll retain
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
those and we definitely want the good
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
processes to stay um but that brings up
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
another point with um you know with 54
 
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
different boards with 54 sets of
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
different um procedures set forth we
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
have for instance um they may all be or
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
they a lot of them may be good
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
procedures but um they can be different
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
so we have may have one board that says
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
you have to send notice to a leny um
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
that a hearing is going to be held
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
within 30 days of the hearing another
 
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
board may say 14 another board may say
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
45 all in their rules it's it's
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
difficult I believe for our staff to um
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
go into each board and keep track of
 
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
okay the notice requirement for this
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
board is this long this board is this
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
long and and the related piece of that
 
00:40:02.829 --> 00:40:02.839 align:start position:0%
is um and this is for any of you
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
especially for any of you on jail car is
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
that if there's a statutory change that
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
requires a change to um to the
 
00:40:13.309 --> 00:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
investigation procedures for the boards
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
we currently have to go into 54 sets of
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
rules and change change that and um the
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
rul making process is a difficult
 
00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.069 align:start position:0%
rul making process is a difficult
process

00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:26.839 align:start position:0%
um and for more procedural general rules
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that makes
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
sense what doesn't make sense sorry to
 
00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:39.079 align:start position:0%
to right now um I if there was a change
 
00:40:39.079 --> 00:40:39.790 align:start position:0%
to right now um I if there was a change
to

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
541a um that laid out a different um
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
process that boards need to follow for
 
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
investigations or hearings um I would
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
need to change 54 different sets of
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
rules um or you change the leg
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
legislation say boards have the right to
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
ass sign dates for hearings or set dates
 
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
for hearings and these these issues
 
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
could be handled one at a time but I
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
would also suggest that if there are
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
some boards that have
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
um poor or
 
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
no investigative
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
procedures that we delete the statutes
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
authorizing them and allow this to cover
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
them I mean you've got a wide range of
 
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
cap ability between the boards some of
 
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
them like the Board of Medicine and the
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
board of psychology have welldeveloped
 
00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.630 align:start position:0%
board of psychology have welldeveloped
investigatory

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
investigatory
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
procedures uh I don't know
 
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
about the the Midwifery Council for have
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
her sakes we always use that as the
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
example but there's got to be some of
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
the boards where the statutes
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
are minimal and the rules are uh they
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
don't really do much in the way of
 
00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.270 align:start position:0%
don't really do much in the way of
Investigation

00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
if I if I if I may get back to Tom
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
that's interesting what you've just
 
00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
talked about but it's not our point
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
of who has Authority ultimate Authority
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
for investigation and discipline and I
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
welcome re echoing uh responding to
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
Debbie Warner's point that oplc has been
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
wonderful to work with I still want the
 
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
law to say that and it doesn't matter
 
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
whether there're 54 or 540 agencies that
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
can be specified in the law the other
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
issues you talked about sure they're
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
complicated I don't know what we'll do
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
about that but that's not the Focus
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
right now the focus is um who's in
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
charge of Investigations and who assists
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
and for me as far before I can support
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
this I want to see this I'll use the
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
good faith term words SM to reflect that
 
00:42:59.790 --> 00:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
so that it does not supplant any
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
existing Authority that oplc that the
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
present procedure continues but I want
 
00:43:09.309 --> 00:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
that uh so unless I hear from others on
 
00:43:16.349 --> 00:43:16.359 align:start position:0%
the committee or everybody's chairman as
 
00:43:18.549 --> 00:43:18.559 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned on my subcommittees
 
00:43:20.349 --> 00:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
if I don't hear anything else I'm going
 
00:43:20.359 --> 00:43:21.710 align:start position:0%
if I don't hear anything else I'm going
to

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:43:24.549 --> 00:43:24.559 align:start position:0%
ask uh I'm gon to ask the subcommittee
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%

00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
Judy representative Maguire and I about

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.549 align:start position:0%
ask oh o' Brian I'm sorry uh
about

00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:37.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
recrating or putting some introductory
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
statement or
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
redrafting oh good morning
 
00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
representative sh um redrafting this so
 
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
that it is what we've talked about is
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
clear not implied but
 
00:43:59.069 --> 00:43:59.079 align:start position:0%
clear yeah is that do we I strongly
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
agree with you uh representative uh
 
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
O'Brien how do you feel about
 
00:44:08.549 --> 00:44:08.559 align:start position:0%
that uh no I agree uh there seems to be
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
some problems I think uh we have
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
identified them and I think it uh we'll
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
be able to come up with a solution uh
 
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
with the help of Mr Porter Mr brck I
 
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.069 align:start position:0%
with the help of Mr Porter Mr brck I
hope

00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
hope
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
Andes representative Judy how do you
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
what how do you feel about asking uh the
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
oplc people to draft uh language making
 
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.910 align:start position:0%
 
explicit

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
explicit
 
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.950 align:start position:0%
explicit
represent

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
yes yes the
 
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
language the language for me because we
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
have H one of uh uh I forgot his
 
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
name uh who really really uh
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
touch me when he explained what's going
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
on in the O
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
oplc so I think reporter yes I have
 
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
to you got it to okay uh yes I would
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
agree because both Dr Warner and I when
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
we read through this assumed that it was
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
the procedure and the existing board
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
just procedure procedures would have to
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
be repealed and since that's not the
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
intent uh I think it needs to be way
 
00:45:37.549 --> 00:45:37.559 align:start position:0%
more explicit okay uh Mr broadrick Mr
 
00:45:41.309 --> 00:45:41.319 align:start position:0%
Porter Tom uh Mike do you is this
 
00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
resonate with you can you do this for
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
us yeah I um we're happy to go back and
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
take a look at this and get uh get
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
something back to the subcommittee okay
 
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
great thank you I think we're G have
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
another session we will okay uh now
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
there are other issues that I have un
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
with the bill and I'd like to go along
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
start proceed with them and invite the
 
00:46:10.829 --> 00:46:10.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
either interrupt or bring up their own
 
00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
as I proceed through the bill okay that
 
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.309 align:start position:0%
as I proceed through the bill okay that
sound

00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
sound
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable all right
 
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
um the there is a question of
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
confidentiality running through of this
 
00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to develop that because I
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
don't I think
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's that doesn't have this I think
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's clear the things are
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
confidential except until well let me
 
00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.549 align:start position:0%
confidential except until well let me
wait

00:46:40.549 --> 00:46:40.559 align:start position:0%
wait
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
first on page 42 line
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
18 it says the office report May
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
disclose information required to law
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement or Health licensing
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
agencies uh
 
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
under what
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
conditions now I'm pointing out that all
 
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
of everything that we're reading here is
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
new law so this is I'm not we're not
 
00:47:08.109 --> 00:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
dealing with existing statute everything
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
from I one j g i one is inserted in A3
 
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
where A1 this is all new it say this is
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
all new so I think I'm sort of perhaps
 
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
I'm apologizing for the question but I'd
 
00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
like to see under what should there be a
 
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
statement subcommittee what do you think
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
should there be a statement uh that this
 
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:35.720 align:start position:0%
information that's disclosed there
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
should be circumstances under which that
 
00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:38.910 align:start position:0%
should be circumstances under which that
is

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
done you imagining problem here no I it
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
it I think it should be clearer that law
 
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement I mean if you find evidence
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
of a crime yes that would be that's one
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
thing but
 
00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.309 align:start position:0%
thing but
um

00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
if there's if you've got innocent people
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
involved you don't necessarily want to
 
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
re reveal their information while you're
 
00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:05.559 align:start position:0%
at it or to or to Health licensing
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
agencies I I think that needs some uh s
 
00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
uh representative O'Brien and
 
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
representative Judy we're doing the
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
talking here but I want to make sure
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
that what I'm saying is okay with you
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to see a condition or some
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
some conditions applied to uh line 19
 
00:48:29.309 --> 00:48:29.319 align:start position:0%
and for that matter I want to hear if
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt and goalie are
 
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
still here representative Shu I invite
 
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
anybody on the Edna Comm anyone to
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
comment on what I've just said Mr
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
chairman if I may go ahead H thank you
 
00:48:45.309 --> 00:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
um yeah I can see the concerns with this
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
but then I you know with the usual
 
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
caveats you know I don't want to give
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
private information particularly if
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
somebody is Innocent but at the same
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
time we talked about yesterday with
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
compact ta and other things where
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
somebody uh might have an issue in
 
00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
another state uh and they may call up
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and say what's going on do
 
00:49:09.789 --> 00:49:09.799 align:start position:0%
you have any uh any complaints about
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
this particular provider or something
 
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
with this limit an investigation from
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
another state to come in to you know
 
00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
help weed out the bad practitioners if
 
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
that was the
 
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
case well that that has to do with the
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
investigation I'm thinking now things
 
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
uncovered in the
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
investigation I would like to I you're I
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
think you're not disagreeing with the
 
00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
fact that there should be some circum
 
00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
they just can't the law should say there
 
00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:40.839 align:start position:0%
are conditions under which this
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
information is yeah you're correct yes
 
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr you're correct in that
 
00:49:47.309 --> 00:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
summary but I don't uh I want to make
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
sure that the board has the capability
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
to do what I think we intended to do to
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
have the investigation uh
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
and I think that's enough to say about
 
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
that right now uh representative Judy do
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
say tell you what I will proceed and if
 
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
you have if anyone has uh comments
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
objections uh some you got four hands up
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
oh I didn't well I'm having trouble with
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
hands that's why I'm I'm listing for you
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry uh okay let's
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
did you wish to speak uh Dr War uh yes
 
00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
yes the language that you're talking
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
about on that line um there's similar
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
language in our statute 329 the 22 Roman
 
00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
1 the second half of that paragraph
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
includes a similar thing but it has the
 
00:50:51.789 --> 00:50:51.799 align:start position:0%
conditions that representative Maguire
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
was seemed to be concerned about and it
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
says here the board May disclose
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
information acquired in an investigation
 
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
to law enforcement only if it involves
 
00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
suspected criminal activity to Health
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
licensing agencies in this state or any
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
other jurisdiction if the leny has or is
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
seeking additional licenses or as
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
required by specific statutory
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
requirements or court orders um so that
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
is more specific and you know might help
 
00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.950 align:start position:0%
is more specific and you know might help
your

00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
concern and that help uh because I I'm
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
going to be I will ask unless the
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh doesn't feel the way I
 
00:51:35.789 --> 00:51:35.799 align:start position:0%
do that this should that that a
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
condition such as
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.549 --> 00:51:45.559 align:start position:0%
included I I agree okay uh and
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
representative Brian said much the same
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
also okay as I said I think I'll proceed
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
and just look for hands as I say these
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
things after I get finished or while I'm
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
doing it if you
 
00:52:02.789 --> 00:52:02.799 align:start position:0%
have questions along the way um you can
 
00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.109 --> 00:52:10.119 align:start position:0%
Brer thank you um I was just uh Dr
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
Warner had pretty much explained what I
 
00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.030 align:start position:0%
Warner had pretty much explained what I
had

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
said this exact language came from the
 
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
majority of our boards the majority of
 
00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:19.240 align:start position:0%
our boards already have this exact
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
language um psychologists uh their
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
statute is a little more specific there
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
are a few boards that are missing this
 
00:52:28.349 --> 00:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
language the the intent you know the
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
boards will share information with other
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
states to prevent Bad actors from um
 
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
Crossing Lines there are times I believe
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
that we've uh boards have shared
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
information with DHHS uh and um law
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement on crimes we've
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately seen some pretty serious
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
cases that need to be reported to law
 
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement the other piece we'll need
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
to think about is some of our boards
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
have a federal requirement to um report
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
to the National practitioners Data Bank
 
00:52:57.069 --> 00:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
so we would need to make sure that that
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
is able to be continued if you would
 
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:00.839 align:start position:0%
like to put some sort of conditions on
 
00:53:02.589 --> 00:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
here well fortunately I don't have to
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
come up with the language right okay I
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
hope you're not not doing anything
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
during lunch
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%

director office of professional
 
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
licensure um Tom and Dr Warner pretty
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
much uh covered what I was going to say
 
00:53:34.829 --> 00:53:34.839 align:start position:0%
um but I am here for the rest of the
 
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting should you have any
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
questions regarding this
 
00:53:41.309 --> 00:53:41.319 align:start position:0%
bill well as I said you'll be invited to
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%

you very much representative
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you Mr chairman uh just a
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
couple of bits of information number one
 
00:53:54.789 --> 00:53:54.799 align:start position:0%
is uh with regard to confidentiality
 
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
which was mentioned earlier uh there was
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee on which I sat about uh
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
six or seven years ago with former
 
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
representative Neil Kirk a former uh AG
 
00:54:10.349 --> 00:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
uh at that time Sarah blet who became
 
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
acting executive director for a while as
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
some of us will
 
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
recall and it was specifically about
 
00:54:20.109 --> 00:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
maintenance of confidentiality records
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
so if somebody complains about a
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
psychologist psychiatrist or a mental
 
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
health worker uh anyone across the board
 
00:54:28.829 --> 00:54:28.839 align:start position:0%
in that regard there could be
 
00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
confidential information that would be
 
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
gerine to the you know to the
 
00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
investigation or prosecution of
 
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
misbehavior by a practitioner um and
 
00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
that stuff sits around uh like ticking
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
time bombs in our in our records in our
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
fighting cabinets and so forth so but uh
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
Sarah might be available out there
 
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
someplace or honorable Neil clerk uh to
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
to talk to us about that um but that
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's an aspect that uh would be
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
especially sensitive uh and it was kind
 
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
of alluded to maybe not with full
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
recognition of the time bomb aspects of
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
it um but also uh especially in the
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
medical professions uh it certainly is
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
the case that there would be situations
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh where an immediate uh intervention on
 
00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:25.799 align:start position:0%
the part of the the law uh is required
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
to to shut somebody down who's not only
 
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
a bad actor but a very significant
 
00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:35.720 align:start position:0%
danger to the public uh so that that it
 
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
was referenced not today but in the
 
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
previous testimony on the bill uh those
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
those issues have not been addressed yet
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
so I have to step away but I want to I
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
want to congratulate everybody on this
 
00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
is a very serious and productive
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
discussion so uh we got good people
 
00:55:56.109 --> 00:55:56.119 align:start position:0%
expert people so this is going in the
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
right direction in my opinion
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid I'm not it's not
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
that I'm unconcerned with privacy I'm
 
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
just not say it seems like this is a
 
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
well-traveled well documented through
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm not going to say ouch until
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
they step on my foot right I I I don't I
 
00:56:14.589 --> 00:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
don't I don't need to do anything except
 
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
just wave that particular issue in terms
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
of giving this subcommittee some
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
information that I am privy to having
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
been on the subcommittee with Sarah and
 
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
Ne Neil Kirk back in the day uh and
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
nobody was
 
00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
else so be be advised thank you thank
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
you for the background thank you you're
 
00:56:40.109 --> 00:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
welcome bye bye that was respect to the
 
00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
psychology and mental health boards yes
 
00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
and both Dr Warner and I served on that
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so the psychology board and
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
the mental health board have
 
00:56:49.599 --> 00:56:51.549 align:start position:0%
the mental health board have
well-crafted

00:56:51.549 --> 00:56:51.559 align:start position:0%
well-crafted
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
privacy U protections well this bill
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
reflects that it does I think yes uh
 
00:57:01.029 --> 00:57:01.039 align:start position:0%
this one needs a little flushing out
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
two yes did you just call on me yes I
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
think you had your hand up yes thank you
 
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
so much um yes um there are a number of
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
people here are new um but it was 2011
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
when um this came forward that the
 
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office was uh taking
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
patients medical records without their
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge or consent for the use of
 
00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:29.480 align:start position:0%
invest investigations and that was
 
00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
concerning third party
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
um Associates um let's say you wanted to
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
investigate a pattern with a doctor and
 
00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
you would requisition records that were
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
not part of the complaint um that went
 
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
through the governor and Council through
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
jail car through this committee through
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
the House and Senate and unanimous ly
 
00:57:59.710 --> 00:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
the bipartisan everybody was against
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
that happening and so what resulted was
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
the wording that is loaded into section
 
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
in are you speaking you've cut
 
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
out and and so there are those involved
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
here in this process in this bill who
 
00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:28.599 align:start position:0%
had never touched that that process was
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
worked out with representative kurk and
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
um Sarah blet who was representing the
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
Apu at that time and also your
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with uh representative
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
Schmidt uh representative Maguire uh
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
representative scitec and others and um
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
it was very well-crafted it was a long
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
process to craft that dealing with
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
recusal issues and all sorts of things
 
00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
like that um but it was well done and
 
00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
agreed to by AG's office and um the
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
parties uh of the the um petitioning for
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
the law and so if you're going to borrow
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
cool stuff I would hope that you might
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
borrow that for the other boards and um
 
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
it would be very much an enhancement I'd
 
00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:20.559 align:start position:0%
be very happy to help with the revision
 
00:59:24.029 --> 00:59:24.039 align:start position:0%
process and I be um I won't be
 
00:59:24.039 --> 00:59:27.829 align:start position:0%
process and I be um I won't be
long-winded

00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
Mr brck has been attentively listening
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
and will welcome the the
 
00:59:35.789 --> 00:59:35.799 align:start position:0%
assistance okay uh if I may I'd like to
 
00:59:38.829 --> 00:59:38.839 align:start position:0%
move on I had a little trouble with uh
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
Roman five allegations of professional
 
00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:43.640 align:start position:0%
conduct shall be brought within five
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
years from the time of uh that the
 
00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
office reasonably could have discovered
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
the ACT well you what's that mean
 
00:59:56.829 --> 00:59:56.839 align:start position:0%
exactly uh it's you I would have thought
 
00:59:58.750 --> 00:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
statute of limitation says five years
 
01:00:02.109 --> 01:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
cut and dry it happened five six years
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
ago we don't look at it what's that
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
reasonably could have been discovered
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
works Mr BR Mr H
 
01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:18.559 align:start position:0%
Porter thank you so I can only use an
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
example from a real estate uh commission
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
case that I had where um the the party
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
was unlicensed than conducting
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar in the state and um
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
what we found was there were some cases
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
that were outside the scope of the with
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
with regard to the statute of
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
limitations um however the argument
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
initially was that there was no
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable way to find this information
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
but for this current investigation which
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
was within the statute of limitations um
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately the case settled and we
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
didn't end up litigating that but this
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
is this is one of those situations where
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
a real estate transaction may happen uh
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
seven years ago uh but we only find out
 
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
about it through the course of an
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
investigation that falls within the
 
01:01:11.069 --> 01:01:11.079 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations this this allows
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
us to claw back to that transaction to
 
01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:15.799 align:start position:0%
say there was no reasonable way we could
 
01:01:18.029 --> 01:01:18.039 align:start position:0%
have discovered that but for this
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
ongoing investigation so it's there are
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
times when you have
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
to claw beond beyond the statute of
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
limitations but it's a pretty it's a
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
pretty high standard to show it's not
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
very easy to to overcome that hurdle but
 
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
it is an important hurdle uh to to
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
remain in there I I don't think it'll be
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
a practical problem but it sounds like
 
01:01:42.029 --> 01:01:42.039 align:start position:0%
you call your way back forever because
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
if whever you find it it could be 20
 
01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:47.720 align:start position:0%
years later uh that that the title is
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
flawed because of was an unlicensed
 
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
broker uh you can call back then because
 
01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
from 20
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
years uh I don't think it's a practical
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
problem but I unless somebody else wants
 
01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
to develop that just representative Bri
 
01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:05.799 align:start position:0%
wants to speak okay representative
 
01:02:05.799 --> 01:02:11.309 align:start position:0%
wants to speak okay representative
O'Brien

01:02:11.309 --> 01:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair uh at this
 
01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
particular time if I can beg uh leave of
 
01:02:20.109 --> 01:02:20.119 align:start position:0%
this committee I do have a doctor's
 
01:02:22.029 --> 01:02:22.039 align:start position:0%
appointment down in Boston and it's
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
getting within the time for me to
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
disappear for that so uh I ask your
 
01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
Indulgence and I will catch up with you
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
on uh the rest of the facts of this but
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Brian I think
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
we've covered the the big piece of this
 
01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
there is more wordsmithing to be done
 
01:02:40.109 --> 01:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
but I think you've heard the most of it
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
and if you want to put yourself on
 
01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
speaker phone in the car you're welcome
 
01:02:47.309 --> 01:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
to I'll have to ask my wife she doesn't
 
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
she doesn't share the same interest in
 
01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
government that I do okay well H happy
 
01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
doctor thank you sir thank you Mr BR did
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
you have something to say uh I was just
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
going to add that this language is um is
 
01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
pretty standard it's already in uh 332
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
g91 which applies to most but not all of
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
oplc boards um and as Mr Porter said
 
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
there's just some instances uh think
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
about a uh this is used in the criminal
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
context too a doctor that maybe did
 
01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
something negligently um but it doesn't
 
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
get discovered by the patient until s
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
years later um something that was put
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
internally incorrectly or something
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
along those lines um this is a way that
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
they can still be held viable Mr brck
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
even though I had said this is new law I
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
suspected this was boilerplate and that
 
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
I my heart really wasn't in it but I
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
wanted next item that I want to talk
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
about is Romans six the board May
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
dismiss a complaint if the allegations
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
do not State a claim of professional
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
misconduct what's that for that's you
 
01:03:59.069 --> 01:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
know it's sort of like saying please do
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
sign um I'm sorry I did forgot to raise
 
01:04:10.109 --> 01:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
my hand um there are times when the
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
boards receive complaints that do not
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
fit the um the qualifications of
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
misconduct under the statute it may be
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
um an angry ex spouse or a neighbor that
 
01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:24.750 align:start position:0%
um an angry ex spouse or a neighbor that
said

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:27.880 align:start position:0%
something um perhaps bad about the
 
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
person but it isn't professional
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
misconduct um so I think this just
 
01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
making clear those cases can be
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
dismissed okay
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
um yeah it doesn't do any harm it's just
 
01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
puzzling that uh let me see uh I'm
 
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
trying to read my notes here for my next
 
01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:53.150 align:start position:0%
trying to read my notes here for my next
Point

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.210 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:55.210 --> 01:04:55.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:57.309 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:04:57.309 --> 01:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:05:02.109 --> 01:05:02.119 align:start position:0%
two line oh um yes the last line on that
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
page page 42 in proceedings in
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
accordance with procedural rules adopted
 
01:05:09.269 --> 01:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
by the executive
 
01:05:12.589 --> 01:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
director when I see rules and adopted I
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
think of jard does he uh is this
 
01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
exempting uh or saying the director can
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
make her own rules without jaar
 
01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:26.599 align:start position:0%
involvement no that should not
 
01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
be do we need to add in accordance
 
01:05:30.079 --> 01:05:33.150 align:start position:0%
be do we need to add in accordance
with

01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
541a Tom I'm sorry yes I had wanted to
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
say something about the previous line 30
 
01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
um that our board has a very long
 
01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
section about um how to dismiss a
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
complaint and I'm wondering if the way
 
01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
this is said it's very simple and it it
 
01:05:54.269 --> 01:05:54.279 align:start position:0%
won't cover all of our our issues um is
 
01:05:57.269 --> 01:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
this going to override ours if this
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
stands as
 
01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.670 align:start position:0%
stands as
[Music]

01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
written uh I'm going to say that it's
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
not going to override it because it's
 
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
dismissals unless Mr broadrick has
 
01:06:23.549 --> 01:06:23.559 align:start position:0%
something disagrees uh well I was gonna
 
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
first respond to um your previous
 
01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:27.799 align:start position:0%
comment and and represented Maguire's
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
comment if you look at on page 41 lines
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
19 through 26 um this adds um to the
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
opl's rulemaking statute this adds that
 
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
the the executive May director May
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
Implement rules on hearings and
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings so it
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
adds short answer no we don't need to
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
add um a statement that these rules must
 
01:06:54.269 --> 01:06:54.279 align:start position:0%
go through jail car because lines
 
01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
through 24 on page 41 um state that
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.069 --> 01:07:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair I just wanted
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
to bring up a little concern on that
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
language um where it says the board May
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
dismiss should it should it be changed
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
to to be specific to all boards that
 
01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
boards and similar to the language which
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
is right below it on line 33 boards
 
01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
which shall include all boards councils
 
01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.269 align:start position:0%
which shall include all boards councils
and

01:07:32.269 --> 01:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
complaint yes for symmetry I should say
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's that's uh since we since
 
01:07:47.789 --> 01:07:47.799 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some changes I think
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
that it's let's put that in because it's
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
referencing just specifically the board
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
not stating I mean where it could be any
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
of the boards or commissions oh good
 
01:07:57.039 --> 01:08:00.069 align:start position:0%
of the boards or commissions oh good
good

01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.710 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:14.839 align:start position:0%
next point
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:24.290 align:start position:0%

let's get I don't think that's terribly
 
01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:12.310 align:start position:0%
important um uh there was something some

01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
negotiating this stuff it's it's uh
 
01:10:57.070 --> 01:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
confidential is that am I reading that
 
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
correctly that's correct okay
 
01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.270 align:start position:0%
correctly that's correct okay

[Music]
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh yeah uh page 43 Romans
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
7 uh this concerned boards councils and
 
01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
commissions may take non-disciplinary
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
remedial action against any person
 
01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
finding that a person is Afflicted with
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
physical mental
 
01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.070 align:start position:0%
physical mental
disabilities

01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh is there a due process there uh I
 
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
mean I realize it's not criminal but the
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
fact is you don't give them a chance to
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
advocate for themselves or say uh it's
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
not gas like I really am you know this
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
is real or something I'm not saying that
 
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
well um it seems who's making the well I
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
see who's making the
 
01:11:47.229 --> 01:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
determination but is there a an
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
licensed or certified person to respond
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
I don't see that Mr Porter is nodding
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
so Mr Porter um so I can defer to the
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
executive director I think the um and
 
01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
it's a case I recently had where uh we
 
01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
have to give the leny the opportunity
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
first to receive notice and be heard uh
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
before making that recommendation so we
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
work with or some the board's work with
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire PHP the professional
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
health uh Network where we we see nurses
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
let say who are engaged uh let's say
 
01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
drug diversion of some sort uh but there
 
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
may be an underlying condition um they
 
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
have a right to be heard before they can
 
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
be ordered potentially by the board to
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh go through an evaluation with the PHP
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
and then follow their recommendations so
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
in lie of you know going after their
 
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
license what we're trying to do is give
 
01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
them an opportunity um to resolve
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
whatever issues may be going on in their
 
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
life at the time um and what we end up
 
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
doing in many of those instances is
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
entering into a settlement
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
agreement that is crafted you know by us
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
as well as with a lot of input from the
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
PHP because they're the mental health
 
01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
experts and um so this is
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
really that's great you're doing a great
 
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
that's great thing to say but there's no
 
01:13:19.629 --> 01:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
you don't talk about giving them notice
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
or an opportunity to respond here I
 
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
think the the situation is that upon
 
01:13:29.229 --> 01:13:29.239 align:start position:0%
finding needs a little clarification is
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
there a hearing a settlement what kind
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
of due process is there and I'm sure
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
there yes so um it's it's it's actually
 
01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
in the board of nursing practice act
 
01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
it's the language is actually in there
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
um but we actually go a little further
 
01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
you know due process rights are are
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
rights that every leny has um whether
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
they're spelled out in the in the U
 
01:13:59.950 --> 01:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
statute it's just they have a a property
 
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
interest in their license and therefore
 
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
due process applies and that's one of
 
01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.189 align:start position:0%
due process applies and that's one of
our

01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
Hallmark portions of this is ensuring U
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
due process protections are afforded to
 
01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.229 align:start position:0%
due process protections are afforded to
all

01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
lenses yeah but I think I think just
 
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
adding that language after hearing I
 
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
think that would that would remedy the
 
01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:22.149 align:start position:0%
think that would that would remedy the
subcommittee's

01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
concerns yeah we need need a phrase
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
there to say what the appropriate due
 
01:14:29.629 --> 01:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
process is I'd like to see more but at
 
01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.629 --> 01:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair and I too have
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
a little concerned about that I
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
understand it may be um part of the
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
language in the nurse Practice Act but
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
um reading some of this um Afflicted
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
with physical mental disease disorder or
 
01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.189 align:start position:0%
with physical mental disease disorder or
condition

01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
condition
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
um considered Dangerous by on to the
 
01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
public health um we getting into medical
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
records or how how are we finding out
 
01:15:04.629 --> 01:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
diseases and disorders of licenses and
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's my
 
01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.629 align:start position:0%
that's that's my
concern

01:15:09.629 --> 01:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
yes that's why we need to express what
 
01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
the due process is and what the hearing
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
is because I mean you don't want a
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
dentist with Parkinson's with shaky
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
hands and you also don't want a nurse
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:31.669 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
agree moving along to uh line 10 of page
 
01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.430 align:start position:0%
agree moving along to uh line 10 of page
44

01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%

Bill

01:15:58.750 --> 01:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
58 and they will the rules will go
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
through jail car when they fin okay so
 
01:16:04.159 --> 01:16:06.070 align:start position:0%
through jail car when they fin okay so
we

01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:09.390 align:start position:0%
we
just

01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh line 15 says any member of the board
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
or other person qualified to act as
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
presiding officer who would that
 
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
be uh you could have a former board
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
member you could have a hearing officer
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
from from the AG do they have the
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
authority to to uh preside once they are
 
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
appointed by the board
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
yes I mean as we kept explaining
 
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
designated board can't appoint anybody
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
designated yes yeah all right uh uh
 
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire has settled me
 
01:16:53.629 --> 01:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
down unless someone else from op C wants
 
01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
to say something or anyone
 
01:16:58.510 --> 01:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
else I mean the only thing I would say
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair is that we are currently
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
implementing that model here in the
 
01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
office we have an attorney who's an ex
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
hearing examiner all the boards have the
 
01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
capability of um designating um that
 
01:17:12.910 --> 01:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
individual to be a hearing examiner um
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
so this just clarifies that all boards
 
01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
have that
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
capability uh on the same page uh line
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
27 disciplinary and Licensing
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
proceedings why is licensing there why
 
01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
is it just in disciplinary because the
 
01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
boards can hold hearings to consider
 
01:17:36.189 --> 01:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
whether a person meets the requirements
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
of a license some of the boards have
 
01:17:40.229 --> 01:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
rather subtle
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
requirements uh is that
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
correct yes that's correct often it
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
comes up in the context of it's It's
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
unclear based on an application whether
 
01:17:50.629 --> 01:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
they meet the requirements so they'll
 
01:17:52.629 --> 01:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
hold a hearing and have the leny come
 
01:17:52.639 --> 01:17:56.870 align:start position:0%
hold a hearing and have the leny come
forward

01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh on line 32 on that fine thank
 
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
you on line 32 of that page approving a
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
settled agreement or issuing a consent
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
order isn't a consent order and a
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
thing somebody oplc I look I personally
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
legally look at consent orders a little
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
bit differently and that a settlement
 
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
agreement you're proving settlement
 
01:18:25.229 --> 01:18:25.239 align:start position:0%
agreement a consent order is like an
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
order of the board they function as the
 
01:18:30.669 --> 01:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
same so um I don't know Tom do you have
 
01:18:30.679 --> 01:18:32.270 align:start position:0%
same so um I don't know Tom do you have
any

01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
thoughts um not really I not really I
 
01:18:39.310 --> 01:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know a board that has
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
issued a consent order to be honest that
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
um okay but to issue a consent order is
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
like insisting on voluntary compliance I
 
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
you can issue an order but issue a
 
01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
consent order have they consented
 
01:18:56.629 --> 01:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
they've been ordered so um I don't know
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
if this if this would be considered a
 
01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
consent order board sometimes will
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
before adjudicating a case they will um
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
get together and Mr Porter would get
 
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
together the leny and have the licensees
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
sign a preliminary agreement not to
 
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
practice um and this this comes up if
 
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
the allegation against them is
 
01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:17.560 align:start position:0%
particularly egregious sometimes they'll
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
say Okay um rather than you taking
 
01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
immediate suspension of my license I
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
will voluntarily agree not to practice
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
in the interim um while this is
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
investigated and and heard that may be
 
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
uh an example of the consent order so we
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
we'll call that semi
 
01:19:38.629 --> 01:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
voluntary yeah I mean they have the
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
they'd have the right to refuse because
 
01:19:42.629 --> 01:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
they of course have due process rights
 
01:19:42.639 --> 01:19:46.830 align:start position:0%
they of course have due process rights
but

01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
yes I have information on that go ahead
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
um a settlement agreement is is the same
 
01:19:59.390 --> 01:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
process as a consent order um in that
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's negotiated and you can any
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
conditions at all that are legal to be
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
done in our statute but the cons the
 
01:20:09.629 --> 01:20:09.639 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement is done prior to
 
01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
the issuance of a notice of hearing once
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
you have a notice of hearing whatever
 
01:20:17.950 --> 01:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
you come up with is then called a
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
consent agreement the consent
 
01:20:23.950 --> 01:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
order I'm not sure I would agree with
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
that Dr Warner you're not it's in our
 
01:20:26.239 --> 01:20:28.110 align:start position:0%
that Dr Warner you're not it's in our
statute

01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
maybe anyway um because it's a different
 
01:20:33.790 --> 01:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
character because your settlement
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
agreement doesn't have a lot of
 
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
publicity until you publish it but the
 
01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:39.910 align:start position:0%
publicity until you publish it but the
consent

01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
agreement has already had the character
 
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
of the order or or the order of
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
investig the notice of hearing has a lot
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
of the information in it and that has
 
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
been made public
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
I think it's just some boards use one
 
01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
Porter Mr Porter you're at
 
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
that thank you so no I I just wanted to
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
say the consent
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
orders we we don't really use we don't
 
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
use them a lot but but I just want to
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
agree with Tom when we do a preliminary
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
agreement not to practice um and that
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
goes before the board and and the the
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
board chair consents to that that that's
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
a consent order by the board essentially
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
whereas a settlement agreement is
 
01:21:36.669 --> 01:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
generally a f the the final stages of of
 
01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
uh litigation or or the adversarial
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
process so um they are a little
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
different um but as far as settlement
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
agreements settlement agreements
 
01:21:48.189 --> 01:21:48.199 align:start position:0%
happened before a notice of hearing is
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
sent out and settlement agreements do H
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
happen quite frequently uh once it
 
01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
notice of hearing is issued so I just
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:09.629 --> 01:22:09.639 align:start position:0%
Roy thank you um I was basically I I um
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
I actually uh was an investigator for
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts Board of Registration
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
of Medicine and the Department of
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
Education and I was just going to
 
01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
actually chime and say what he said is
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
that um the consent decree or consent
 
01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
order is generally preliminary whereas
 
01:22:29.310 --> 01:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
the settlement is a final disposition on
 
01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
the case um a consent not to practice or
 
01:22:35.629 --> 01:22:35.639 align:start position:0%
a consent to limit the scope of practice
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
things of that nature will happen while
 
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
the investigation is under way just so
 
01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
that an emergency hearing to revoke the
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
license isn't done uh so yeah that's
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
just what I wanted to add that okay
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you good um line 35 3435 says they
 
01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
dispositive action taken after the
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
issurance of a public hearing notice
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
when is the public hearing notice
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:13.950 --> 01:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
specified if I may I think it depends on
 
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
the board at the moment um they all have
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
different rules as to when the notice of
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
hearing must issue I think generally
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's within 10 or 14 days but it's
 
01:23:25.149 --> 01:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
dependent upon the board um and
 
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
specified in the board okay okay
 
01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:33.030 align:start position:0%
specified in the board okay okay
um

01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
page um I don't think I had that was all
 
01:23:38.669 --> 01:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward very
 
01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
straightforward I'm not a big fan of
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
putting numbers $3,000 $10,000 in
 
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
statute it's got its pluses and minuses
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
it uh if you say up to the discretion of
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
the board it can go crazy
 
01:23:56.189 --> 01:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
3,000 uh life
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
can never mind I'm wasting your time um
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
46 uh moving ahead uh line four prior to
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
imposing any sections don't you mean
 
01:24:15.390 --> 01:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
sanctions yes that's a
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
typo I want to hear from oplc do you
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
agree I we
 
01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.669 align:start position:0%
agree I we
agree

01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
agree
 
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't hear you yes we agree
 
01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
Mr uh now I have not I've got through
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
quite a few things here I hope OPC has
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
made a list of what we would like to
 
01:24:41.310 --> 01:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
well let me here um yes there's U line
 
01:24:45.629 --> 01:24:45.639 align:start position:0%
28 down here uh from 25 to 28 for the
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of this paragraph complaint
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
shall be deemed to be unfounded if it is
 
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
not fall within jurisdiction does not
 
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
relate to the actions of the ly or
 
01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
determined to be frivolous what about
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
there is a difference between lack
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
sufficient Merit or evidence and
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
frivolous you don't you don't say just
 
01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.629 align:start position:0%
frivolous you don't you don't say just
doesn't

01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
rise insufficient
 
01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
proof it seems that's omitted should
 
01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
that not be
 
01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
there I think our our point was to make
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
clear what shall what must be considered
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
unfounded and to give the board
 
01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:23.719 align:start position:0%
discretion to determine what else could
 
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
be considered unfounded um obviously
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's clear that frivolous complaints
 
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
must be unfounded or if they lack
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um I think that was the
 
01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
thought process behind that oh all right
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
so that's what the Sha okay shall be
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
deemed unfounded and it may be deemed
 
01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
unfounded under other circumstances it
 
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
will be may be unfounded based on the
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
hearings and investigation right that
 
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
would be on the merits as opposed to
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
these which are just you're you're not
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
in the ballpark right right okay all
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
right uh one of the um things that as we
 
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
close out this fill there you have an
 
01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
appeal to the Supreme Court where
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
wherever it is for if a hearing is
 
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
um 16 yeah uh shall be Supreme uh but
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's no the appeal on rehearing shall
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
be to the Supreme Court that's pretty
 
01:26:32.910 --> 01:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
big deal uh what
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
about suppose the lyed does not
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
agree uh that with that uh the finding
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
of the board
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
was that he was in violation of his his
 
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
license he says no I wasn't I wanted
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
there is no opport opportunity re
 
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
rehearing on line 14 that says that if
 
01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
you're if you've been disciplined or
 
01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
you've been refused to license you can
 
01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
petition for a rehear all right so
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
that's what that that that's the the
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
escape the first round first rep okay
 
01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
and if and if you go through two through
 
01:27:13.870 --> 01:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
the rehearing and you're still unhappy
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
then you go to the Supreme Court okay
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
all right that that addresses my concern
 
01:27:20.830 --> 01:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
I did not read that well shall I
 
01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
summarize where the we're hoping for
 
01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
some better language uh I was looking
 
01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
for very much very much for that yes
 
01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:28.639 align:start position:0%
please because some of the points I made
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
are just information understanded others
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
needs correction okay so starting on
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
page 41 we want a clear statement that
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
the the board that this does not
 
01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:47.639 align:start position:0%
supplant existing board uh
 
01:27:50.189 --> 01:27:50.199 align:start position:0%
proceed investigatory powers and that
 
01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
the boards have the authority
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
and the office will assign a an
 
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
investigator when the board asks them to
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't know exact I don't we don't
 
01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
have any language that we're we're
 
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
hoping you will have some that will
 
01:28:11.189 --> 01:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
explain that this is a supplemental
 
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
one all right on if I may interrupt I've
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
got it great we we can't lay the egg but
 
01:28:18.990 --> 01:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
we can tell if it's bad
 
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
right all right on uh page 42 line to
 
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
um the executive director or the boards
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
are authorized to do those things um and
 
01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:35.790 align:start position:0%
are authorized to do those things um and
more

01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
importantly section lines 18 to 20 we
 
01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.910 align:start position:0%
importantly section lines 18 to 20 we
need

01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:42.750 align:start position:0%
need
some

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
restrictions and need to consider
 
01:28:49.229 --> 01:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
compacts criminal Behavior Federal
 
01:28:51.109 --> 01:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
requirements for reporting and things
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
like that um
 
01:28:55.870 --> 01:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
um again this
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
is what's here may not be incorrect but
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's incomplete that's the main
 
01:29:04.510 --> 01:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
thing about I haven't gone there yet
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
sorry on line 30 we want to insert which
 
01:29:11.229 --> 01:29:11.239 align:start position:0%
shall include all boards councils Etc
 
01:29:11.239 --> 01:29:12.790 align:start position:0%
shall include all boards councils Etc
after

01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.310 align:start position:0%
after
board

01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
such grammatical
 
01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.510 align:start position:0%
such grammatical
change

01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.669 align:start position:0%
change
on

01:29:20.669 --> 01:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:29:24.270 --> 01:29:24.280 align:start position:0%
um page 43 line
 
01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
15 we're okay there on line
 
01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
33 after line 34 after finding we need
 
01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
to include a phrase the hearing or the
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity of hearing or due process or
 
01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
whatever something to explain that the
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
board just hasn't made it up on their
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
own and the person has had a chance to
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
it three page with no
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
comments on page 46 line four the last
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
word is
 
01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
well I think the the proper language is
 
01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:16.280 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the statutes but we'd like
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
it to be to be clearer here and and if
 
01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
there's any of the board that have
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
investigatory pop or disciplinary issues
 
01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:27.950 align:start position:0%
investigatory pop or disciplinary issues
that

01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
are totally inadequate that you feel
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
free to add them to the repeals on
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
making and did the subcommittee uh I
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
think we're going I we will meet again
 
01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
based on when
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
oplc if you if op oplc Breeze uh to
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
draft this language when you will have
 
01:30:59.109 --> 01:30:59.119 align:start position:0%
something ready for us to examine uh
 
01:31:02.830 --> 01:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
call it an amendment to section seven um
 
01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh oplc when do you think you could have
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
some assuming you're in agreement I
 
01:31:09.310 --> 01:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
think it sounds like you are uh when do
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
you think we could see
 
01:31:13.390 --> 01:31:13.400 align:start position:0%
something I mean I think we can
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
certainly get the committee something by
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
the end of the day tomorrow wow that's
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's faster than we need so yeah I
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
mean it this shouldn't take very long
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
there aren't many um changes I think
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
that need to be made so we can get we
 
01:31:33.310 --> 01:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
can get that to you this week our
 
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
deadline for everyone's information is

anything they'd like to start off the
 
03:00:28.080 --> 03:00:29.190 align:start position:0%
anything they'd like to start off the
discussion

03:00:29.190 --> 03:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
03:00:32.309 --> 03:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
with um if I could
 
03:00:35.309 --> 03:00:35.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely so yeah I went through this
 
03:00:39.030 --> 03:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
and took some notes on it and um you
 
03:00:43.309 --> 03:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
know it it proposes that we join two uh
 
03:00:46.110 --> 03:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
separate seate interstate compacts one
 
03:00:48.910 --> 03:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with Audiology and speech
 
03:00:52.309 --> 03:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
pathologists and the other one with uh
 
03:00:54.630 --> 03:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy and uh the reason I
 
03:00:56.910 --> 03:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
was asking if there's somebody from oplc
 
03:01:01.269 --> 03:01:01.279 align:start position:0%
on is um my first question is how we
 
03:01:04.750 --> 03:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
deal with this I mean what happens if we
 
03:01:07.910 --> 03:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
want to make any changes to it um you
 
03:01:09.469 --> 03:01:09.479 align:start position:0%
know what's the process after that I
 
03:01:11.710 --> 03:01:11.720 align:start position:0%
mean you know who who actually wrote
 
03:01:15.070 --> 03:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
this up um how any and which states if
 
03:01:17.229 --> 03:01:17.239 align:start position:0%
any are actually part of this compact
 
03:01:19.670 --> 03:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
already because uh according to it it
 
03:01:21.950 --> 03:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
comes into effect when uh the 10th State
 
03:01:26.110 --> 03:01:26.120 align:start position:0%
joins um and if you know is it in effect
 
03:01:28.309 --> 03:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
now in 10 10 or more
 
03:01:30.269 --> 03:01:30.279 align:start position:0%
States um you know just general
 
03:01:33.030 --> 03:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
questions kind of guide us into what
 
03:01:35.349 --> 03:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to do I mean if we if we
 
03:01:38.309 --> 03:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
make any changes and it's going to
 
03:01:41.150 --> 03:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
require you know let's say there's 10
 
03:01:42.670 --> 03:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
other states involved and 10 other
 
03:01:44.550 --> 03:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
states would have to de decide to agree
 
03:01:48.150 --> 03:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
to it um you know then in effect are we
 
03:01:51.190 --> 03:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
going to be killing the thing um yeah so
 
03:01:53.229 --> 03:01:53.239 align:start position:0%
general questions around that why don't
 
03:01:55.349 --> 03:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
we let uh why don't we let uh Tina Kelly
 
03:01:58.150 --> 03:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead and give us a short um synopsis
 
03:02:01.710 --> 03:02:01.720 align:start position:0%
and start off from there Miss Kelly good
 
03:02:03.349 --> 03:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
morning members of the
 
03:02:07.870 --> 03:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I'm Tina Kelly and um the
 
03:02:10.790 --> 03:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
language that's in the law the way it
 
03:02:13.590 --> 03:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
sits right now that was worked on by the
 
03:02:16.309 --> 03:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
Council of state governments there is a
 
03:02:18.229 --> 03:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
organization that they contract with
 
03:02:19.870 --> 03:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
they've done the physical therapy
 
03:02:22.190 --> 03:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
contract compact they were did the
 
03:02:24.950 --> 03:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
nursing compact so the the development
 
03:02:27.950 --> 03:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
of this compact was done
 
03:02:30.870 --> 03:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
um through the Council of state
 
03:02:33.910 --> 03:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
governments who who has very a lot of
 
03:02:35.630 --> 03:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
experience putting this
 
03:02:39.990 --> 03:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
together um changing the wording of what
 
03:02:42.550 --> 03:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
is going forward in the
 
03:02:44.950 --> 03:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
bill if it changes the meaning of
 
03:02:47.190 --> 03:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
anything I and I'm G to ask Tom to jump
 
03:02:49.510 --> 03:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
in here if if I'm stating any of this
 
03:02:52.309 --> 03:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
wrong but if you change that then we
 
03:02:54.590 --> 03:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
can't go ahead with the the the
 
03:02:56.990 --> 03:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
legislation because it won't match up
 
03:02:59.990 --> 03:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
with what the other states are doing as
 
03:03:02.710 --> 03:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
far as how many states are involved at
 
03:03:04.990 --> 03:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
the present time I do not know there may
 
03:03:07.870 --> 03:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
be somebody from one of the associations
 
03:03:09.670 --> 03:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
that knows how many States presently
 
03:03:11.670 --> 03:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
belong to the
 
03:03:14.910 --> 03:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
compact okay so um in rep response to
 
03:03:17.590 --> 03:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative lexus's question the
 
03:03:20.229 --> 03:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
wording as it stands in this proposed
 
03:03:23.190 --> 03:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
bill is exactly what it has to be to
 
03:03:25.150 --> 03:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
match up to what the other states have
 
03:03:27.070 --> 03:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
agreed to to be in the compact is that
 
03:03:29.630 --> 03:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing that is correct because
 
03:03:31.309 --> 03:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
if we change it we won't match up with
 
03:03:32.750 --> 03:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
them and it won't
 
03:03:36.790 --> 03:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
work okay um have we passed any other
 
03:03:39.750 --> 03:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
legislation similar to this that's
 
03:03:40.990 --> 03:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
already gone
 
03:03:44.070 --> 03:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
through yes the one that I'm very very
 
03:03:46.790 --> 03:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
familiar with is the physical therapy
 
03:03:50.790 --> 03:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
compact it pretty much is it's so
 
03:03:54.269 --> 03:03:54.279 align:start position:0%
closely mirrors this um and that's been
 
03:03:58.229 --> 03:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
effect for four years now I think about
 
03:04:00.910 --> 03:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
there and I've been involved in that
 
03:04:03.269 --> 03:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
since before it started right through
 
03:04:05.110 --> 03:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
getting it through legislation and the
 
03:04:09.190 --> 03:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
implementation of it we run into any
 
03:04:13.030 --> 03:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
issues with this um it worked very well
 
03:04:16.910 --> 03:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
it allowed um it allows people to go and
 
03:04:18.670 --> 03:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
come and even though we're not we don't
 
03:04:21.030 --> 03:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
have a lot of surrounding states that
 
03:04:24.469 --> 03:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
belong to that we do have um people come
 
03:04:26.389 --> 03:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
in temp when temporary workers are
 
03:04:29.510 --> 03:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
needed to fill in I mean it's it's been
 
03:04:31.190 --> 03:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
really good for the
 
03:04:35.309 --> 03:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
businesses I is this um we went over
 
03:04:37.990 --> 03:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
kind of in depth the one uh related to
 
03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:39.550 align:start position:0%
kind of in depth the one uh related to
um

03:04:39.550 --> 03:04:39.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:45.110 --> 03:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
EMTs is this um similar exactly the same
 
03:04:47.790 --> 03:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
the compact structure
 
03:04:51.309 --> 03:04:51.319 align:start position:0%
Etc I don't know what the EMT one looks
 
03:04:53.349 --> 03:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
like I don't really work with that with
 
03:04:56.950 --> 03:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
them at um the one that I can say that I
 
03:04:58.990 --> 03:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
know about is the pt1 that's been in
 
03:05:02.670 --> 03:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
effect that is very similar to this okay
 
03:05:07.630 --> 03:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:11.429 --> 03:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
question well I'm hoping I can help I um
 
03:05:13.429 --> 03:05:13.439 align:start position:0%
have a I I can send everyone this this
 
03:05:16.030 --> 03:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
is a link I'm reading from the
 
03:05:21.429 --> 03:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
um the Senate uh hearing that was and
 
03:05:23.429 --> 03:05:23.439 align:start position:0%
the person who wrote the compact the
 
03:05:28.070 --> 03:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
legal council from CSG Nal calus spoke
 
03:05:31.790 --> 03:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
at the Senate hearing and what she said
 
03:05:34.349 --> 03:05:34.359 align:start position:0%
was that they were the primary uh draft
 
03:05:35.750 --> 03:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
drafter of the
 
03:05:39.150 --> 03:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
compact um that
 
03:05:42.429 --> 03:05:42.439 align:start position:0%
um they would use a mutual recognition
 
03:05:44.389 --> 03:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
model like a driver driver's
 
03:05:49.469 --> 03:05:49.479 align:start position:0%
license and that um Asha took a primary
 
03:05:51.910 --> 03:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
role in crafting the
 
03:05:55.950 --> 03:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
compact um then they ALS Senator Carson
 
03:05:57.590 --> 03:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
had asked what other states were
 
03:05:58.910 --> 03:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
involved in the
 
03:06:01.910 --> 03:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
Compact and they are North Carolina
 
03:06:04.950 --> 03:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
Louisiana Utah West Virginia and
 
03:06:09.030 --> 03:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
Wyoming and it's being considered in 13
 
03:06:11.950 --> 03:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
more and I just interject a little bit
 
03:06:14.110 --> 03:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to interrupt you but I I I
 
03:06:16.030 --> 03:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
just pulled up the Audiology and speech
 
03:06:18.590 --> 03:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
language pathology interstate compact
 
03:06:22.229 --> 03:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
website yeah and they they list as of
 
03:06:25.429 --> 03:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
April 2021 10 states the States you
 
03:06:29.710 --> 03:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned but a few more so I don't know
 
03:06:31.950 --> 03:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
just just to say that and I could list
 
03:06:33.990 --> 03:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
them off to you but that's that's what
 
03:06:36.510 --> 03:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
their website indicates information
 
03:06:39.790 --> 03:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
about the compact thank you I I can send
 
03:06:41.429 --> 03:06:41.439 align:start position:0%
this link to everybody on the
 
03:06:42.750 --> 03:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee because I thought it was
 
03:06:44.630 --> 03:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
very interesting interesting um the
 
03:06:46.550 --> 03:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
information because there are people
 
03:06:48.229 --> 03:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
that testified at this hearing that
 
03:06:51.190 --> 03:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
didn't testify at all okay very good
 
03:06:52.630 --> 03:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you that would be helpful uh
 
03:06:52.640 --> 03:06:54.630 align:start position:0%
thank you that would be helpful uh
representative

03:06:54.630 --> 03:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:06:57.429 --> 03:06:57.439 align:start position:0%
leus uh thank you Mr chair uh I actually
 
03:07:02.229 --> 03:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
have a question for uh Miss Kelly and um
 
03:07:05.429 --> 03:07:05.439 align:start position:0%
you mentioned we've been in uh the PT
 
03:07:08.429 --> 03:07:08.439 align:start position:0%
compact one thing I saw on here is the
 
03:07:12.309 --> 03:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
commission has the authority to uh to do
 
03:07:12.319 --> 03:07:14.309 align:start position:0%
commission has the authority to uh to do
rulemaking

03:07:14.309 --> 03:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
rulemaking
 
03:07:16.349 --> 03:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
and um those go in you know there's
 
03:07:17.830 --> 03:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
public hearings and all that but those
 
03:07:20.790 --> 03:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
go into effect unless a majority of the
 
03:07:24.309 --> 03:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
state legislators I guess oppose them my
 
03:07:26.349 --> 03:07:26.359 align:start position:0%
question is any rules that these uh
 
03:07:28.990 --> 03:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
commissions create how do they interact
 
03:07:30.349 --> 03:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
with the way New Hampshire normally
 
03:07:33.150 --> 03:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
handles rul making in that uh you know
 
03:07:35.429 --> 03:07:35.439 align:start position:0%
they'd have to go before Jael cars um
 
03:07:37.710 --> 03:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
and then there'd be an opportunity there
 
03:07:40.469 --> 03:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
if Jael cars objects to uh to do
 
03:07:43.790 --> 03:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
something about it thank you this this
 
03:07:46.990 --> 03:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
these rules that would be um the bylaws
 
03:07:50.030 --> 03:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
and the rules of the compact commission
 
03:07:52.150 --> 03:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
would not go through jlc car they do
 
03:07:55.070 --> 03:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
they have their own rul making um
 
03:07:57.550 --> 03:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
process which is described in here but
 
03:08:00.630 --> 03:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
it's basically the only rules that they
 
03:08:00.640 --> 03:08:02.190 align:start position:0%
it's basically the only rules that they
are

03:08:02.190 --> 03:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:08:06.630 --> 03:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
um are writing would be rules and bylaws
 
03:08:09.990 --> 03:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
that govern the compact itself and how
 
03:08:15.750 --> 03:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:17.670 --> 03:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
followup if I could yeah absolutely go
 
03:08:22.150 --> 03:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
ahead so um you know I hope it wouldn't
 
03:08:24.510 --> 03:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
be an issue but if uh you know New
 
03:08:26.950 --> 03:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire did object to any of these the
 
03:08:29.309 --> 03:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
uh you know somebody I guess would have
 
03:08:30.990 --> 03:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
to would they have to do what introduce
 
03:08:34.030 --> 03:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
a a resolution saying we object or how
 
03:08:36.469 --> 03:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
would it work short of withdrawing from
 
03:08:39.870 --> 03:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
the whole thing I I believe that is
 
03:08:42.550 --> 03:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's ex um explained in the compact I
 
03:08:45.710 --> 03:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
was looking over I'm not like an expert
 
03:08:48.510 --> 03:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
on everything in there but under Section
 
03:08:52.190 --> 03:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
10 is it outlines the rule making
 
03:08:55.349 --> 03:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
process for the compact
 
03:08:57.469 --> 03:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
commission yeah I looked I looked at
 
03:08:57.479 --> 03:08:59.750 align:start position:0%
commission yeah I looked I looked at
that

03:08:59.750 --> 03:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:09:02.990 --> 03:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
um so yeah my concern is I mean this is
 
03:09:05.150 --> 03:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
this would put in place rules that
 
03:09:08.269 --> 03:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
would you know affect New Hampshire and
 
03:09:11.630 --> 03:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh and certainly audiologists and
 
03:09:13.469 --> 03:09:13.479 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
03:09:16.469 --> 03:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't affect it wouldn't affect the
 
03:09:19.349 --> 03:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
practice of that audiologist in New
 
03:09:22.269 --> 03:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it would affect their ability
 
03:09:25.750 --> 03:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
to become part of the compact go from
 
03:09:29.590 --> 03:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
one compact state to another um the
 
03:09:32.389 --> 03:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
rules would set up dispute resolutions
 
03:09:33.550 --> 03:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
between two
 
03:09:37.150 --> 03:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
states if there were two Li a
 
03:09:37.160 --> 03:09:38.870 align:start position:0%
states if there were two Li a
lcy

03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
lcy
 
03:09:42.389 --> 03:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
um rules on their the database they're
 
03:09:45.389 --> 03:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
developing thing so it's it's more
 
03:09:48.590 --> 03:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
concentrated on the compact commission
 
03:09:51.510 --> 03:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
than it is the practice of the liccy in
 
03:09:52.870 --> 03:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New
 
03:09:55.950 --> 03:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I have a question if if we
 
03:10:00.389 --> 03:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
join the compact does that prohibit us
 
03:10:04.110 --> 03:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
from adjusting our scope and rules of
 
03:10:06.950 --> 03:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
practice going forward in other words if
 
03:10:10.910 --> 03:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
we do something to change how we um deal
 
03:10:14.190 --> 03:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
with or conduct licensing in this field
 
03:10:16.150 --> 03:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
would that automatically kick us out of
 
03:10:18.030 --> 03:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
the compact would it put us in violation
 
03:10:19.750 --> 03:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
of the agreement in other words is the
 
03:10:21.550 --> 03:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
legislator's hands going to be tied
 
03:10:24.550 --> 03:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
forever because we're in the compact so
 
03:10:26.750 --> 03:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
that we can't make any
 
03:10:29.990 --> 03:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
adjustments no we can do rule making to
 
03:10:32.030 --> 03:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
the rules of the State of New Hampshire
 
03:10:34.070 --> 03:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
at any time we want we don't have to ask
 
03:10:35.710 --> 03:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
permission for the compact we don't have
 
03:10:39.030 --> 03:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
to get their approval the only caveat to
 
03:10:42.429 --> 03:10:42.439 align:start position:0%
that would be there's a minimum set of
 
03:10:45.510 --> 03:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
criter criteria that somebody needs to
 
03:10:49.269 --> 03:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
have in order to be a compact member
 
03:10:51.790 --> 03:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
that would be everybody's agreed that
 
03:10:53.550 --> 03:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
the and it's and it's pretty uniform for
 
03:10:55.269 --> 03:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
these practices anyways that the
 
03:10:58.510 --> 03:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
education should be um for speech
 
03:11:01.349 --> 03:11:01.359 align:start position:0%
language pathology Audiology the
 
03:11:05.110 --> 03:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
examination should be um the national
 
03:11:08.070 --> 03:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
exam there should be a background check
 
03:11:10.510 --> 03:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
and there should be a certain level of
 
03:11:13.349 --> 03:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
continuing education and that is the
 
03:11:15.389 --> 03:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
minimum standard those are the pretty
 
03:11:18.550 --> 03:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
much the things that you wouldn't be
 
03:11:19.510 --> 03:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
able to
 
03:11:23.110 --> 03:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
change to lessen you could make them
 
03:11:25.070 --> 03:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
more stringent but you couldn't lessen
 
03:11:27.830 --> 03:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
them or then you would be in violation
 
03:11:30.590 --> 03:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
of the compact but there isn't many of
 
03:11:32.670 --> 03:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
those things it's just a
 
03:11:36.910 --> 03:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
baseline for um the qualifications of a
 
03:11:40.550 --> 03:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
licy okay representative
 
03:11:43.590 --> 03:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair uh just a
 
03:11:45.150 --> 03:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
couple quick questions because I want to
 
03:11:47.389 --> 03:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
go back to some of the questioning I had
 
03:11:50.229 --> 03:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
on these compacts um during the public
 
03:11:54.630 --> 03:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
hearing and I guess my first question is
 
03:11:56.950 --> 03:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
while CSG is doing the boilerplate
 
03:11:59.750 --> 03:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
language was this originally intended I
 
03:12:01.550 --> 03:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
think part of the hearing public hearing
 
03:12:05.590 --> 03:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
we heard was uh it was brought to csg's
 
03:12:07.590 --> 03:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
attention for military families to
 
03:12:09.630 --> 03:12:09.640 align:start position:0%
alleviate uh some of the issues they
 
03:12:12.469 --> 03:12:12.479 align:start position:0%
have uh moving from Base to Base with
 
03:12:12.479 --> 03:12:13.389 align:start position:0%
have uh moving from Base to Base with
about

03:12:13.389 --> 03:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:12:16.750 --> 03:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
um and that's my question first question
 
03:12:18.750 --> 03:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
was the intent of this legislation the
 
03:12:20.950 --> 03:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
original compacts for
 
03:12:23.309 --> 03:12:23.319 align:start position:0%
military and
 
03:12:26.190 --> 03:12:26.200 align:start position:0%
family I am not sure if that was the
 
03:12:29.030 --> 03:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
original attent um
 
03:12:32.950 --> 03:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
intent it's my what I've always heard
 
03:12:35.790 --> 03:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
and what the benefit is to the military
 
03:12:37.870 --> 03:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
there's a big benefit to Military and
 
03:12:41.830 --> 03:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
military families but this was intended
 
03:12:41.840 --> 03:12:44.190 align:start position:0%
military families but this was intended
to

03:12:44.190 --> 03:12:44.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:12:47.429 --> 03:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
facilitate um individuals being able to
 
03:12:50.750 --> 03:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
travel easily between states with how
 
03:12:52.670 --> 03:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
without having to keep doing the same
 
03:12:54.670 --> 03:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
thing over and over again submitting
 
03:12:57.110 --> 03:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
their transcripts submitting a proof of
 
03:13:00.389 --> 03:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
exam to help facilitate that ease of
 
03:13:02.790 --> 03:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
Mobility for all like people who are in
 
03:13:05.670 --> 03:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
this profession who are
 
03:13:08.750 --> 03:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
licensed follow up yes go ahead thank
 
03:13:11.070 --> 03:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
you uh one of the other concerns and
 
03:13:13.269 --> 03:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
this is what
 
03:13:15.670 --> 03:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
kind of puts my cold feet to this
 
03:13:20.190 --> 03:13:20.200 align:start position:0%
compact deal is when we start looking at
 
03:13:22.670 --> 03:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
we hear mobility and traveling and
 
03:13:25.550 --> 03:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
moving from state to state um if we get
 
03:13:27.150 --> 03:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
an influx
 
03:13:29.830 --> 03:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
of licensed individuals from other
 
03:13:31.870 --> 03:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
states coming to New Hampshire to work
 
03:13:33.349 --> 03:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
under other states
 
03:13:35.790 --> 03:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
licensing um and there's investigations
 
03:13:38.309 --> 03:13:38.319 align:start position:0%
of whatever kind it may be on any one of
 
03:13:38.319 --> 03:13:39.429 align:start position:0%
of whatever kind it may be on any one of
these

03:13:39.429 --> 03:13:39.439 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:13:42.110 --> 03:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
individuals um and this is where I want
 
03:13:45.110 --> 03:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
to hear from op PLC um are we in charge
 
03:13:47.670 --> 03:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
of the investigation if it is brought
 
03:13:49.630 --> 03:13:49.640 align:start position:0%
forward under someone who is from
 
03:13:51.389 --> 03:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
another state licensed under another
 
03:13:53.870 --> 03:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
state say whether it's Louisiana um
 
03:13:56.110 --> 03:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
someone travels up here a complaint is
 
03:13:58.190 --> 03:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
filed against that individual who heads
 
03:14:01.229 --> 03:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
up that in investigation and uh where
 
03:14:02.670 --> 03:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
does it go from there I want full
 
03:14:05.429 --> 03:14:05.439 align:start position:0%
details on how this will work it depends
 
03:14:07.870 --> 03:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
on where that patient or client is
 
03:14:10.229 --> 03:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
located if the patient or client is
 
03:14:12.630 --> 03:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
located in the state of New Hampshire we
 
03:14:14.670 --> 03:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
would open a full
 
03:14:16.950 --> 03:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
investigation um I believe and I'm
 
03:14:19.190 --> 03:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
trying to see in here if it says it that
 
03:14:22.150 --> 03:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
I it's my understanding is that once an
 
03:14:24.349 --> 03:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
investigation is opened the compact
 
03:14:26.710 --> 03:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
commission would be
 
03:14:31.150 --> 03:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
notified and so we couldn't take any
 
03:14:34.309 --> 03:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
action against the person's license we
 
03:14:36.070 --> 03:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
would take the action against the
 
03:14:38.229 --> 03:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
person's privileged to practice in the
 
03:14:39.389 --> 03:14:39.399 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
03:14:42.469 --> 03:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if the allegations were found
 
03:14:44.070 --> 03:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
founded we would take away their
 
03:14:45.670 --> 03:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice they would lose
 
03:14:47.870 --> 03:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
all their privileges to practices
 
03:14:49.830 --> 03:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
practice in all the other states and
 
03:14:52.510 --> 03:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
then the home state would take action
 
03:14:54.349 --> 03:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
against the
 
03:14:58.710 --> 03:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:02.429 --> 03:15:02.439 align:start position:0%
ahead so through due process
 
03:15:04.870 --> 03:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
if this investigation goes back to the
 
03:15:07.630 --> 03:15:07.640 align:start position:0%
home state and say the home State's
 
03:15:11.229 --> 03:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
Louisiana uh witnesses to this that need
 
03:15:12.550 --> 03:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
to be brought forward for the public
 
03:15:14.830 --> 03:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
hearing do they need to travel to
 
03:15:17.070 --> 03:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
Louisiana representative goalie I think
 
03:15:18.429 --> 03:15:18.439 align:start position:0%
I think what she said was that the
 
03:15:20.590 --> 03:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
investigation would occur in New
 
03:15:23.469 --> 03:15:23.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we would take action
 
03:15:25.469 --> 03:15:25.479 align:start position:0%
against their right to practice in the
 
03:15:28.070 --> 03:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the results of that would
 
03:15:30.150 --> 03:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
be referred to their home state for
 
03:15:32.469 --> 03:15:32.479 align:start position:0%
further action if that's what I was
 
03:15:34.070 --> 03:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
hearing correctly was that correct Miss
 
03:15:36.710 --> 03:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
Kelly that's
 
03:15:40.110 --> 03:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
correct but is not the true hearing on
 
03:15:43.229 --> 03:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
the individual's license being done
 
03:15:44.710 --> 03:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
in their home
 
03:15:48.309 --> 03:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
state on their on their license they
 
03:15:50.830 --> 03:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
would take action in their home state on
 
03:15:53.990 --> 03:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:56.510 --> 03:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
yes so does a person go before their
 
03:15:58.830 --> 03:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
home state for a hearing for that
 
03:15:58.840 --> 03:16:00.670 align:start position:0%
home state for a hearing for that
license

03:16:00.670 --> 03:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:16:03.309 --> 03:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
revocation if that was what it was or a
 
03:16:06.110 --> 03:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
reciprocal action most of the time
 
03:16:08.910 --> 03:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't end up in revocation it may end
 
03:16:11.550 --> 03:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
up in a sanction against the license
 
03:16:15.429 --> 03:16:15.439 align:start position:0%
continuing educ ation finds whatever and
 
03:16:17.389 --> 03:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
they could take reciprocal
 
03:16:20.349 --> 03:16:20.359 align:start position:0%
action is is is can you find out if
 
03:16:23.030 --> 03:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's ever been a a case I'd like to
 
03:16:25.070 --> 03:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
see a real world example of this in
 
03:16:27.349 --> 03:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
practice has there been a case where
 
03:16:29.670 --> 03:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
somebody in the compact has been
 
03:16:32.189 --> 03:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
investigated and and action taken
 
03:16:35.590 --> 03:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
against them in the visiting State and
 
03:16:37.590 --> 03:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
then what happened when it was referred
 
03:16:39.790 --> 03:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
back to their home state I because I I
 
03:16:41.750 --> 03:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
agree with representative goalie I I'd
 
03:16:44.229 --> 03:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
like to see the the the mechanics of how
 
03:16:46.590 --> 03:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
this would work because someone has a
 
03:16:49.030 --> 03:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
property vested property right right in
 
03:16:51.389 --> 03:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
their license so they would be entitled
 
03:16:53.950 --> 03:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
to a a due process hearing in their
 
03:16:57.269 --> 03:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
state and I don't know if what we
 
03:16:59.510 --> 03:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
investigate and do in the Hampshire
 
03:17:02.630 --> 03:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
would uh would adequately fulfill that
 
03:17:04.550 --> 03:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
Mr bradrick could you perhaps answer
 
03:17:04.560 --> 03:17:07.269 align:start position:0%
Mr bradrick could you perhaps answer
that

03:17:07.269 --> 03:17:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:09.590 --> 03:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
question yes uh and thank you
 
03:17:12.630 --> 03:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
representative Roy and um I I believe I
 
03:17:16.870 --> 03:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
can so I I think of them differently you
 
03:17:19.269 --> 03:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
have your home state license and your
 
03:17:21.790 --> 03:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice the allows you you
 
03:17:24.309 --> 03:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
can I can be here in New Hampshire if I
 
03:17:26.750 --> 03:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
am in a if this compact passed I could
 
03:17:27.950 --> 03:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
be here in New Hampshire and I could
 
03:17:29.950 --> 03:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
just have a New Hampshire license still
 
03:17:32.110 --> 03:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
and then I would be um only able to
 
03:17:34.710 --> 03:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
practice here in New Hampshire if I I
 
03:17:37.309 --> 03:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
then joined the compact if I then got my
 
03:17:38.510 --> 03:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice through the
 
03:17:39.950 --> 03:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
compact it's almost like I hold a
 
03:17:42.349 --> 03:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
separate license that allows me to go to
 
03:17:45.269 --> 03:17:45.279 align:start position:0%
another state that that's what would be
 
03:17:48.349 --> 03:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
taken away um so representative goalie
 
03:17:52.349 --> 03:17:52.359 align:start position:0%
to your example someone um a speech
 
03:17:55.429 --> 03:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
language pathologist is doing work in
 
03:17:57.429 --> 03:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who's originally licensed
 
03:18:00.550 --> 03:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
in Louisiana if they commit misconduct
 
03:18:04.389 --> 03:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire our board can take
 
03:18:05.950 --> 03:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
action against their privilege to
 
03:18:08.790 --> 03:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
practice through it would they' still
 
03:18:11.349 --> 03:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
have a hearing they'd have a notice of
 
03:18:13.269 --> 03:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
the charges against then they' have a
 
03:18:15.309 --> 03:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
hearing at the end of that hearing our
 
03:18:16.950 --> 03:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
board could decide to revoke their
 
03:18:18.429 --> 03:18:18.439 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice here in New
 
03:18:20.429 --> 03:18:20.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so they couldn't practice here
 
03:18:22.910 --> 03:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um our public are
 
03:18:25.790 --> 03:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
protected in addition um I'd have to
 
03:18:27.830 --> 03:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
find where it says this but once we
 
03:18:30.389 --> 03:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
revoke their privilege to practice uh
 
03:18:34.030 --> 03:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
notification gets sent to the compact um
 
03:18:36.349 --> 03:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
and I don't remember if the compact
 
03:18:38.150 --> 03:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
automatically revokes their privileged
 
03:18:41.750 --> 03:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
practice in any other state or or I'd
 
03:18:42.830 --> 03:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
have to
 
03:18:47.349 --> 03:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
look into that but we we still are able
 
03:18:50.510 --> 03:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
to protect our own citizens does that
 
03:18:52.790 --> 03:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
but what happens what happens to their
 
03:18:55.389 --> 03:18:55.399 align:start position:0%
actual license from their home state in
 
03:18:57.469 --> 03:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
other words so okay we refer it the
 
03:18:59.349 --> 03:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
contact revokes their right to be a
 
03:19:00.590 --> 03:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
member of the
 
03:19:03.590 --> 03:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
compact then the I'm assuming the whole
 
03:19:05.309 --> 03:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
matter would be referred to the home
 
03:19:07.950 --> 03:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
state well now the home state wants to
 
03:19:09.590 --> 03:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
take action do they have to have a whole
 
03:19:11.630 --> 03:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
other due process hearing where they
 
03:19:13.189 --> 03:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
won't be ble to produce New Hampshire
 
03:19:15.229 --> 03:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
Witnesses or all that or they can they
 
03:19:17.429 --> 03:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
rely simply on the record of the New
 
03:19:17.439 --> 03:19:18.349 align:start position:0%
rely simply on the record of the New
Hampshire

03:19:18.349 --> 03:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:19:21.590 --> 03:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
proceeding it it probably depends on the
 
03:19:24.750 --> 03:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
home States uh Practice Act there I
 
03:19:26.590 --> 03:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
would tell you in New Hampshire that
 
03:19:28.510 --> 03:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
someone would have I believe they'd have
 
03:19:31.269 --> 03:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
to have a whole another that if the
 
03:19:32.870 --> 03:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
reverse it was a new New Hampshire
 
03:19:35.150 --> 03:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
practitioner that committed misconduct
 
03:19:36.910 --> 03:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
in Louisiana had their life their
 
03:19:39.389 --> 03:19:39.399 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice taken away if the
 
03:19:40.790 --> 03:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire board then caught wind of
 
03:19:42.469 --> 03:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
it and said we want to revoke New
 
03:19:45.150 --> 03:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license um I believe we'd have
 
03:19:47.630 --> 03:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
to hold another hearing I do see um and
 
03:19:49.189 --> 03:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to pass the buck Susan
 
03:19:51.870 --> 03:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
Adams from Asha who helped draft this
 
03:19:54.750 --> 03:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
legislation or her her group did so if
 
03:19:57.510 --> 03:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
I'm misspeaking Susan please let me know
 
03:19:59.070 --> 03:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
no I think you're I think you're right
 
03:20:01.630 --> 03:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
on target um like you said New Hampshire
 
03:20:03.710 --> 03:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
only has the right to revoke the
 
03:20:06.510 --> 03:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice in that state and
 
03:20:08.830 --> 03:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
once that privilege is revoked the home
 
03:20:13.590 --> 03:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
state can choose or not um to have a due
 
03:20:15.790 --> 03:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
process hearing to revoke their license
 
03:20:18.269 --> 03:20:18.279 align:start position:0%
depending on what kind of bad action
 
03:20:21.510 --> 03:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
they they had in New Hampshire um some
 
03:20:23.990 --> 03:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
states you know the kind of the joke
 
03:20:26.110 --> 03:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
that we had when we were um working on
 
03:20:29.150 --> 03:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
this compact was marijuana marijuana is
 
03:20:31.349 --> 03:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
legal in some states not legal in other
 
03:20:36.790 --> 03:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
states so if your bad action um was to
 
03:20:39.950 --> 03:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
partake in marijuana and your home state
 
03:20:42.550 --> 03:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't that isn't illegal in your home
 
03:20:44.189 --> 03:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
state then your home state probably
 
03:20:46.389 --> 03:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take action against your your
 
03:20:49.150 --> 03:20:49.160 align:start position:0%
state license so it's really up to the
 
03:20:51.790 --> 03:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
home state to decide whether or not that
 
03:20:54.150 --> 03:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
action has reached a level to where they
 
03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
would contemplate removing your state
 
03:20:58.790 --> 03:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
license and then once your state license
 
03:21:01.110 --> 03:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
is removed you you lose all of your
 
03:21:04.870 --> 03:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:06.830 --> 03:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
03:21:10.830 --> 03:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
Shu or representative goalie were you
 
03:21:13.710 --> 03:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
done no that still doesn't answer my
 
03:21:16.510 --> 03:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
question if the home state has a hearing
 
03:21:18.030 --> 03:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
do the witnesses have to travel from
 
03:21:21.229 --> 03:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
state to state for that hearing so let
 
03:21:25.030 --> 03:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
me let me um put it like this I mean
 
03:21:28.070 --> 03:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
because we heard from Mr brck that New
 
03:21:28.990 --> 03:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would have a whole another
 
03:21:30.349 --> 03:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
hearing if it was something that took
 
03:21:32.189 --> 03:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
place in Louisiana with a New Hampshire
 
03:21:34.990 --> 03:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
license holder so when that hearing
 
03:21:37.710 --> 03:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
taking place here in New Hampshire do
 
03:21:40.110 --> 03:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
the witnesses have to be
 
03:21:43.389 --> 03:21:43.399 align:start position:0%
present so that that really is up to the
 
03:21:45.309 --> 03:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
the the state that's holding the
 
03:21:47.670 --> 03:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
investigation or hearing but what I will
 
03:21:51.269 --> 03:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
say that basically this is the same as
 
03:21:54.469 --> 03:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
somebody has a license here and they
 
03:21:57.550 --> 03:21:57.560 align:start position:0%
also have a just a license in Louisiana
 
03:21:59.830 --> 03:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
and we take action against that license
 
03:22:02.590 --> 03:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
we would send it on to Louisiana and
 
03:22:04.590 --> 03:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
then their law and rules would kick in
 
03:22:07.269 --> 03:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
and they would do what they needed to do
 
03:22:09.590 --> 03:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
in that situation they could hold a
 
03:22:12.110 --> 03:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
hearing they may not it's it's up to
 
03:22:14.389 --> 03:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
them am
 
03:22:16.990 --> 03:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure if New Hampshire does
 
03:22:19.670 --> 03:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
this but I know that many states have as
 
03:22:23.189 --> 03:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
a condition of lure that if your right
 
03:22:26.030 --> 03:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
to practice in another state is revoked
 
03:22:27.910 --> 03:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's similarly revoked in the state that
 
03:22:29.950 --> 03:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
you got the license so I'm not sure that
 
03:22:32.189 --> 03:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
if a a duplicate due process hearing
 
03:22:36.070 --> 03:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
would be necessary or not um if anyone
 
03:22:39.389 --> 03:22:39.399 align:start position:0%
could speak to that um I think I can and
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
I think this will enter um
 
03:22:45.229 --> 03:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
representative Go's question um
 
03:22:48.070 --> 03:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
it if I was Prosecuting the case for the
 
03:22:52.150 --> 03:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire board um and a someone had
 
03:22:54.750 --> 03:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
had their a New Hampshire Home State
 
03:22:56.910 --> 03:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
lensey who was practicing in in
 
03:22:58.910 --> 03:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
Louisiana and had their privilege to
 
03:23:01.790 --> 03:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
practice there revoked by Louisiana my
 
03:23:03.910 --> 03:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
number one exhibit would be here's the
 
03:23:06.429 --> 03:23:06.439 align:start position:0%
order of Louisiana revoking their
 
03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice um that would
 
03:23:11.550 --> 03:23:11.560 align:start position:0%
probably be enough to pass the uh burden
 
03:23:14.469 --> 03:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
of appr here in New Hampshire 51% that
 
03:23:17.670 --> 03:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
they did something wrong and um their
 
03:23:20.189 --> 03:23:20.199 align:start position:0%
license should be revoked if I want to
 
03:23:23.670 --> 03:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
be extra careful and I can get that um a
 
03:23:26.189 --> 03:23:26.199 align:start position:0%
witness to what happened in Louisiana
 
03:23:28.670 --> 03:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
available to testify via Zoom I would do
 
03:23:31.469 --> 03:23:31.479 align:start position:0%
that but I think you would be using the
 
03:23:33.950 --> 03:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
exhibit of what
 
03:23:36.870 --> 03:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
Louisiana of Louisiana's action is of
 
03:23:38.349 --> 03:23:38.359 align:start position:0%
proof that it occurred and the reason
 
03:23:40.750 --> 03:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
that we'd be taking away the license as
 
03:23:43.630 --> 03:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
long as Louisiana an offered a a hearing
 
03:23:45.550 --> 03:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
that provided the same substantial due
 
03:23:47.510 --> 03:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
process rights as in Hampshire I would
 
03:23:48.990 --> 03:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
think that judicial notice of the
 
03:23:50.750 --> 03:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
previous hearing they wouldn't have to
 
03:23:52.550 --> 03:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
redo it over again just because it's in
 
03:23:54.670 --> 03:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
a different geography is that
 
03:23:57.830 --> 03:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
correct um we would
 
03:23:59.910 --> 03:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh we wouldn't have to have a whole
 
03:23:59.920 --> 03:24:00.830 align:start position:0%
uh we wouldn't have to have a whole
hearing

03:24:00.830 --> 03:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:24:04.030 --> 03:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
over they would be they do have a due
 
03:24:05.790 --> 03:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
process right in their home state
 
03:24:07.950 --> 03:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
license because we'd be taking action
 
03:24:09.990 --> 03:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
against a different license so we would
 
03:24:12.189 --> 03:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
have to provide notice to them and the
 
03:24:15.830 --> 03:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a hearing um they might
 
03:24:17.870 --> 03:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
it would be it wouldn't be as large of a
 
03:24:19.870 --> 03:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
hearing for that very reason that it's
 
03:24:21.870 --> 03:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
already the underlying issues have
 
03:24:25.070 --> 03:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
already been um dealt with in Louisiana
 
03:24:26.750 --> 03:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
and we could use that Louisiana court
 
03:24:29.110 --> 03:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
order or not court order sorry board
 
03:24:32.110 --> 03:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
order is our proof um but there would
 
03:24:34.269 --> 03:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
still be a a brief hearing here in New
 
03:24:38.269 --> 03:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay thank you if I could um
 
03:24:40.990 --> 03:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
yeah um yeah some of this I think is
 
03:24:43.110 --> 03:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
addressed if if you look at page 10
 
03:24:46.150 --> 03:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
starting at line 24 section 7 adverse
 
03:24:49.269 --> 03:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
actions it deals with
 
03:24:52.670 --> 03:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
um you know what what the U member State
 
03:24:56.510 --> 03:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
the remote State can do and this is um
 
03:24:58.830 --> 03:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
around the privilege to practice and
 
03:25:00.670 --> 03:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
their right to have practice as part of
 
03:25:03.950 --> 03:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
the compact rather than H State one and
 
03:25:05.910 --> 03:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
I could see there being concerns because
 
03:25:08.070 --> 03:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
the practitioner may be remote and other
 
03:25:09.550 --> 03:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
information that we would want in New
 
03:25:13.150 --> 03:25:13.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is remote and it does say that
 
03:25:15.189 --> 03:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
um you know we could issue subpoenas for
 
03:25:16.630 --> 03:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
both hearings and investigations
 
03:25:18.790 --> 03:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
requiring attendance testimony
 
03:25:22.110 --> 03:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
Witnesses um we'd have to pay to get
 
03:25:24.070 --> 03:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
people here but it does say you know we
 
03:25:27.510 --> 03:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
could uh recover those costs from the uh
 
03:25:29.550 --> 03:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
person the action was being taken
 
03:25:31.750 --> 03:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
against so anyway there is some language
 
03:25:34.150 --> 03:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
in here uh dealing with that and also
 
03:25:35.349 --> 03:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
with joint
 
03:25:37.510 --> 03:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
investigations okay thank you uh
 
03:25:39.710 --> 03:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative Shu um you're not on the
 
03:25:41.150 --> 03:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so if you could just say
 
03:25:43.670 --> 03:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
where you are and you know the 91a stuff
 
03:25:46.670 --> 03:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
please before you sure thank you yes I'm
 
03:25:49.429 --> 03:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
um zooming in from my home in Pembrook
 
03:25:50.750 --> 03:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
and I am
 
03:25:55.269 --> 03:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
alone um I just wanted to point out that
 
03:25:57.670 --> 03:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
um well first of all I'll just comment
 
03:26:00.790 --> 03:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
the thought occurred to me that um
 
03:26:04.269 --> 03:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
talking about testifying for a hearing
 
03:26:07.070 --> 03:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire is pretty used to using
 
03:26:09.710 --> 03:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
Zoom but I would point out that many
 
03:26:11.950 --> 03:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
states particularly Southern stat such
 
03:26:15.110 --> 03:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
as Louisiana have been more demanding
 
03:26:18.630 --> 03:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
about uh people attending in person so I
 
03:26:21.910 --> 03:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
think we might have some conflicts with
 
03:26:25.229 --> 03:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
uh trying to make our case via the
 
03:26:27.870 --> 03:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
Internet what I was originally going to
 
03:26:30.389 --> 03:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
say though I heard Miss Kelly talking
 
03:26:34.830 --> 03:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
about uh each state in the compact would
 
03:26:37.830 --> 03:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
be basically able to make their own
 
03:26:41.910 --> 03:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
rules and serving as a member of JAL car
 
03:26:45.030 --> 03:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
I will point out that New Hampshire is
 
03:26:50.110 --> 03:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
pretty well known as being um the most
 
03:26:53.150 --> 03:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
legislative active regarding our
 
03:26:56.429 --> 03:26:56.439 align:start position:0%
administrative rules process uh we have
 
03:26:59.150 --> 03:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
more legislative input in that process
 
03:27:02.510 --> 03:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
than any other state in the US I believe
 
03:27:05.790 --> 03:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding so if other
 
03:27:09.349 --> 03:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
states are making their own rules uh
 
03:27:12.469 --> 03:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
that seems like it could be atic in
 
03:27:15.750 --> 03:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
regards to how the compact is treated by
 
03:27:18.630 --> 03:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
each state um I just wanted to point
 
03:27:21.950 --> 03:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
that out thank you I I just if I could I
 
03:27:24.150 --> 03:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
would say that the from my reading of
 
03:27:27.469 --> 03:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
the bill it says the the rule making
 
03:27:30.550 --> 03:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
Authority pertains only to the compact
 
03:27:33.429 --> 03:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
itself not to the scope or extent of
 
03:27:35.349 --> 03:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
practice within the state so we would
 
03:27:37.510 --> 03:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
still have authority over how the rules
 
03:27:39.670 --> 03:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
are made for with everything that
 
03:27:41.790 --> 03:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
happens within our state the the rul
 
03:27:43.710 --> 03:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
making Authority for this would only
 
03:27:47.630 --> 03:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
apply to um uh how we interact in the
 
03:27:50.229 --> 03:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
compact um uh representative grto you've
 
03:27:52.269 --> 03:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
had your hand up for a
 
03:27:54.990 --> 03:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
while thank you that's exactly what I
 
03:27:57.070 --> 03:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
was goingon to say I think that if we if
 
03:28:00.469 --> 03:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
we use the the license let's use the
 
03:28:04.070 --> 03:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
driver license analogy you know um these
 
03:28:06.429 --> 03:28:06.439 align:start position:0%
audiologists would have a license
 
03:28:08.550 --> 03:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
similar to a driver's license that was
 
03:28:10.229 --> 03:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
actually issued by the
 
03:28:14.429 --> 03:28:14.439 align:start position:0%
compact and then my concern is if
 
03:28:17.469 --> 03:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
somebody does something in a state
 
03:28:18.910 --> 03:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of concerns I have
 
03:28:20.870 --> 03:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
number one these states and these
 
03:28:24.710 --> 03:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
compacts are very far away and you know
 
03:28:27.349 --> 03:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
is there
 
03:28:30.590 --> 03:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
um are do have we entered in these in
 
03:28:34.309 --> 03:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
compacts with states that are this far
 
03:28:39.150 --> 03:28:39.160 align:start position:0%
from our our own State um number two um
 
03:28:41.550 --> 03:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
we would have to be very involved with
 
03:28:44.469 --> 03:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
the rul making of the compact
 
03:28:47.910 --> 03:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
itself and um do we have the I mean do
 
03:28:53.070 --> 03:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
we have that ability to put some um
 
03:28:56.590 --> 03:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
language in through this legislation or
 
03:28:57.910 --> 03:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
through other
 
03:29:00.670 --> 03:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
ways so that we know that New
 
03:29:03.830 --> 03:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's residents are protected and
 
03:29:06.429 --> 03:29:06.439 align:start position:0%
our state is protected for example if
 
03:29:08.269 --> 03:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
somebody does something
 
03:29:12.030 --> 03:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
in um a state other than their home
 
03:29:16.429 --> 03:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
state and um there's an issue like let's
 
03:29:18.870 --> 03:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
say they have a license in um North
 
03:29:21.070 --> 03:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
Carolina and something happens in
 
03:29:24.349 --> 03:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
Mississippi how do we know how is that
 
03:29:26.189 --> 03:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
communicated is that it's going to be
 
03:29:28.469 --> 03:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
Comm communicated I guess through the
 
03:29:31.990 --> 03:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
compact right and then with the compact
 
03:29:35.670 --> 03:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
even though it's sort of like the the
 
03:29:39.910 --> 03:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
what happens to that license C is within
 
03:29:43.070 --> 03:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
their own state
 
03:29:47.910 --> 03:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
regulations um how would that if do we
 
03:29:51.750 --> 03:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
have the right to revoke a license from
 
03:29:53.950 --> 03:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
someone who's been who's lost their
 
03:29:55.950 --> 03:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
license in another state or is that the
 
03:29:57.030 --> 03:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
job of the
 
03:29:59.150 --> 03:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
compact I think we already have that
 
03:30:01.070 --> 03:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
even if we don't join the compat uh
 
03:30:03.510 --> 03:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
Senator Sherman thank you go ahead yeah
 
03:30:05.950 --> 03:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
I just want to um thank you for letting
 
03:30:08.870 --> 03:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
me join uh I just wanted to answer some
 
03:30:10.670 --> 03:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
of Jackie's I'm sorry representative
 
03:30:13.870 --> 03:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
grot concerns first of all the person is
 
03:30:15.590 --> 03:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
not licensed by the compact they're
 
03:30:17.429 --> 03:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
licensed by their home
 
03:30:20.510 --> 03:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
state uh and so when you think about the
 
03:30:24.590 --> 03:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
way things work right now um I have um
 
03:30:26.429 --> 03:30:26.439 align:start position:0%
one active license but at one point I
 
03:30:30.630 --> 03:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
had four active licenses I had uh New
 
03:30:32.790 --> 03:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh actually three New
 
03:30:35.189 --> 03:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Virginia and
 
03:30:38.030 --> 03:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and and Tom is absolutely
 
03:30:41.590 --> 03:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
right if something if I were
 
03:30:44.269 --> 03:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
sanctioned at all in any of those States
 
03:30:46.150 --> 03:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
all states would know about it and I'm
 
03:30:48.229 --> 03:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
required to report it just like I'm
 
03:30:50.189 --> 03:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
required to report any malpractice or
 
03:30:51.389 --> 03:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
any other
 
03:30:55.670 --> 03:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
infraction um so in a way the compact
 
03:30:57.349 --> 03:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
actually gives an
 
03:31:00.830 --> 03:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
internal uh conduit for information
 
03:31:04.189 --> 03:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
where um say for example someone is
 
03:31:07.550 --> 03:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
practicing in New Hampshire under the
 
03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
Compact and their home is down in
 
03:31:12.870 --> 03:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
Louisiana the compact actually will make
 
03:31:14.510 --> 03:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
sure that anything that happens in New
 
03:31:17.750 --> 03:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is is known in
 
03:31:22.229 --> 03:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
Louisiana and um so it's in in a way it
 
03:31:23.469 --> 03:31:23.479 align:start position:0%
actually protects New Hampshire
 
03:31:25.990 --> 03:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
residents more while decreasing the
 
03:31:30.189 --> 03:31:30.199 align:start position:0%
regulatory burden and cost on the
 
03:31:35.309 --> 03:31:35.319 align:start position:0%
lensey uh and I and I think the other
 
03:31:37.229 --> 03:31:37.239 align:start position:0%
I'm was trying to remember the earlier
 
03:31:39.309 --> 03:31:39.319 align:start position:0%
point I think that representative goalie
 
03:31:41.550 --> 03:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
was or the question that he was asking
 
03:31:46.070 --> 03:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
asking this really doesn't change much
 
03:31:49.870 --> 03:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
in the way of what would happen if my
 
03:31:52.670 --> 03:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
license in New Hampshire if I lost my
 
03:31:54.389 --> 03:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
license in New Hampshire and I had a
 
03:31:57.110 --> 03:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
license in Virginia Virginia would look
 
03:31:59.590 --> 03:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
at what happened in New Hampshire would
 
03:32:01.710 --> 03:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
make a decision if they felt they needed
 
03:32:04.429 --> 03:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
Witnesses they could call witnesses from
 
03:32:06.510 --> 03:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but they're not compelled
 
03:32:11.189 --> 03:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
to and it's really the that I agree with
 
03:32:13.990 --> 03:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
completely the I have seen Physicians
 
03:32:16.469 --> 03:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
who have lost licenses in one State lose
 
03:32:19.150 --> 03:32:19.160 align:start position:0%
their licenses in other states because
 
03:32:21.510 --> 03:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
of the nature of the infraction that
 
03:32:24.469 --> 03:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
occurred in that one state so we're not
 
03:32:26.590 --> 03:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
Reinventing the wheel here these
 
03:32:28.830 --> 03:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
compacts we have them in nursing already
 
03:32:30.429 --> 03:32:30.439 align:start position:0%
and we've had them for several years
 
03:32:33.510 --> 03:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
they work really well and one of the one
 
03:32:36.590 --> 03:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
of the huge impacts is that it actually
 
03:32:39.710 --> 03:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
decreases the cost of being a
 
03:32:42.070 --> 03:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
professional in New Hampshire
 
03:32:44.950 --> 03:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
um by decreasing the need to relicense
 
03:32:46.229 --> 03:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
in multiple
 
03:32:50.150 --> 03:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
States um so I think I hope Jackie I've
 
03:32:52.349 --> 03:32:52.359 align:start position:0%
answered your
 
03:32:56.429 --> 03:32:56.439 align:start position:0%
questions um but remember this is this
 
03:32:58.630 --> 03:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
is something that right now is actually
 
03:32:58.640 --> 03:32:59.550 align:start position:0%
is something that right now is actually
more

03:32:59.550 --> 03:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:33:02.469 --> 03:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
burdensome because you are licensed in
 
03:33:05.309 --> 03:33:05.319 align:start position:0%
multiple States than being a part of a
 
03:33:08.189 --> 03:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
connected conduit of information with a
 
03:33:09.750 --> 03:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
license in one
 
03:33:13.630 --> 03:33:13.640 align:start position:0%
state Senator Sheran if you could um is
 
03:33:15.510 --> 03:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
this similar to the
 
03:33:18.830 --> 03:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
EMT compact that we discussed earlier in
 
03:33:22.950 --> 03:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
so far as someone utilizing it um it's
 
03:33:25.710 --> 03:33:25.720 align:start position:0%
it's on a temporary you know basis it's
 
03:33:27.150 --> 03:33:27.160 align:start position:0%
not you know you can't just come here
 
03:33:29.189 --> 03:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
and live here and operate under the
 
03:33:31.590 --> 03:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
compact um you'd be required to get a
 
03:33:33.229 --> 03:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
license at some point in New Hampshire
 
03:33:35.510 --> 03:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
is that not true no that's that's not
 
03:33:38.830 --> 03:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
the case so compact nursing uh right now
 
03:33:41.030 --> 03:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
I mean the beauty of it is if if you
 
03:33:41.040 --> 03:33:41.910 align:start position:0%
I mean the beauty of it is if if you
have

03:33:41.910 --> 03:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:33:46.510 --> 03:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
a um suppose I think Maine is looking at
 
03:33:48.910 --> 03:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
this suppose Maine enters into this if
 
03:33:51.110 --> 03:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
it right now if you're a nurse a compact
 
03:33:53.870 --> 03:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
nurse and your license is in Maine and
 
03:33:56.910 --> 03:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
you have a job uh you live in Maine but
 
03:33:58.710 --> 03:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
you have a job in New Hampshire you can
 
03:34:00.110 --> 03:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
come over to New Hampshire you don't
 
03:34:01.189 --> 03:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
have to have a
 
03:34:04.750 --> 03:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
license uh and in in virtually all
 
03:34:07.550 --> 03:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
aspects of health care right now we are
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
deficient in our
 
03:34:12.309 --> 03:34:12.319 align:start position:0%
Workforce um and so this has really been
 
03:34:15.790 --> 03:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
seen as something that makes it uh
 
03:34:17.790 --> 03:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
attractive to practice in New Hampshire
 
03:34:19.229 --> 03:34:19.239 align:start position:0%
because you don't have to have a license
 
03:34:21.710 --> 03:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire if you have if you're
 
03:34:23.510 --> 03:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
part of the if New Hampshire is a part
 
03:34:26.389 --> 03:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
of the compact so it's different but
 
03:34:30.110 --> 03:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
it's different for very important reason
 
03:34:33.349 --> 03:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
which is is that we we need to have
 
03:34:36.389 --> 03:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
people able to be nimble in where they
 
03:34:40.150 --> 03:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
practice uh and these are not high
 
03:34:42.389 --> 03:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily highly
 
03:34:46.269 --> 03:34:46.279 align:start position:0%
reimbursing um professions and so you
 
03:34:48.870 --> 03:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
know $120 or whatever the fee is Tom
 
03:34:51.469 --> 03:34:51.479 align:start position:0%
would know better than I would but
 
03:34:55.550 --> 03:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
whatever that fee is um is is something
 
03:34:58.910 --> 03:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
that um is saved in every state so if
 
03:35:01.510 --> 03:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
somebody lived in Maine and practiced in
 
03:35:03.070 --> 03:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Massachusetts and they
 
03:35:04.910 --> 03:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
were part of a compact that spanned all
 
03:35:06.510 --> 03:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
three states they would only need to be
 
03:35:09.510 --> 03:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
licensed in one state but they would
 
03:35:11.630 --> 03:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
have the same level of screen in in all
 
03:35:13.830 --> 03:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
three states as they would as if they
 
03:35:16.070 --> 03:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
were licensed in all three
 
03:35:19.189 --> 03:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
states and the interconnectivity of the
 
03:35:21.510 --> 03:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
compact actually
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
increases the communication between the
 
03:35:27.110 --> 03:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
states on their performance and
 
03:35:29.870 --> 03:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
competencies what about uh just a second
 
03:35:32.590 --> 03:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
Tony what about off offsetting in other
 
03:35:34.750 --> 03:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
words so if you currently you have to
 
03:35:37.150 --> 03:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
have a license in whatever state you so
 
03:35:38.590 --> 03:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
like yourself you said you had several
 
03:35:41.349 --> 03:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
licenses used to keep active there was a
 
03:35:43.550 --> 03:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
fee Associated that and that fee went to
 
03:35:45.189 --> 03:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
the organization that had the
 
03:35:47.870 --> 03:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility to oversee and and police
 
03:35:50.590 --> 03:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
if you will the the practice in that
 
03:35:53.590 --> 03:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
state if if we have people getting a
 
03:35:56.110 --> 03:35:56.120 align:start position:0%
license in one State Kansas for example
 
03:35:57.630 --> 03:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
and they come and they're practicing
 
03:35:59.790 --> 03:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
here and their license expires and they
 
03:36:02.469 --> 03:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
just keep renewing it in Kansas well
 
03:36:05.309 --> 03:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
Kansas is getting the money but we're
 
03:36:07.670 --> 03:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
we're picking up the duty to to police
 
03:36:10.870 --> 03:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
them and to to um manage that practice
 
03:36:14.070 --> 03:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
in this state is that not the case or in
 
03:36:15.790 --> 03:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
other words are we are we losing ref
 
03:36:18.790 --> 03:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue that that a lot of our boards
 
03:36:21.790 --> 03:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
are require to maintain their own
 
03:36:23.830 --> 03:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
function right well the boards are
 
03:36:26.510 --> 03:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
self-funding as you said and U that's
 
03:36:28.429 --> 03:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
that's a good question might be better
 
03:36:30.349 --> 03:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
for Tom to answer the fiscal side of
 
03:36:33.590 --> 03:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
that or or somebody from oplc to answer
 
03:36:36.670 --> 03:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
how that's handled um Senator Sherman I
 
03:36:39.309 --> 03:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
can I can address that question the
 
03:36:41.870 --> 03:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
states have the ability to assess a fee
 
03:36:44.030 --> 03:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
to each person that they um issue a
 
03:36:45.830 --> 03:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice to and that's
 
03:36:48.189 --> 03:36:48.199 align:start position:0%
specifically to make up any lost revenue
 
03:36:50.950 --> 03:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
from um you know from having previously
 
03:36:52.950 --> 03:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
required that person to get a a full
 
03:36:55.349 --> 03:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
license and is that in the language of
 
03:36:55.359 --> 03:36:56.229 align:start position:0%
license and is that in the language of
the

03:36:56.229 --> 03:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:36:59.550 --> 03:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
statute yep and I would also mention
 
03:36:59.560 --> 03:37:01.150 align:start position:0%
statute yep and I would also mention
your

03:37:01.150 --> 03:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:37:04.590 --> 03:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
um your example of somebody in Kansas uh
 
03:37:06.309 --> 03:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
you know who keeps renewing their
 
03:37:09.110 --> 03:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
license in Kansas if you have physically
 
03:37:12.229 --> 03:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
moved and your state of residence is now
 
03:37:15.150 --> 03:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you are required to get a
 
03:37:17.790 --> 03:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
a home state license in New Hampshire so
 
03:37:19.110 --> 03:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
okay that seemed to contradict what
 
03:37:21.830 --> 03:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Sherman had said where it's
 
03:37:23.349 --> 03:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
where you're basically where you hold
 
03:37:25.349 --> 03:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
your driver's license where you pay your
 
03:37:28.110 --> 03:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
taxes um you have to have that home
 
03:37:30.750 --> 03:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
state license in order to access the
 
03:37:30.760 --> 03:37:32.910 align:start position:0%
state license in order to access the
compact

03:37:32.910 --> 03:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
compact
 
03:37:35.670 --> 03:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
okay I must I think I misunderstood the
 
03:37:37.469 --> 03:37:37.479 align:start position:0%
question but that's correct what Susan
 
03:37:40.389 --> 03:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
said okay thank you representative leus
 
03:37:42.550 --> 03:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um yeah that's one
 
03:37:44.349 --> 03:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
point I was going to make that uh if you
 
03:37:46.910 --> 03:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
move here um you do have to get a lition
 
03:37:50.830 --> 03:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
is for the military uh families that
 
03:37:52.550 --> 03:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
they can have declare their state of
 
03:37:53.910 --> 03:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
residence and they don't have to change
 
03:37:57.030 --> 03:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
it even if they're you know on duty here
 
03:37:58.790 --> 03:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
let's say for a couple of years they can
 
03:38:00.469 --> 03:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
still maintain their home license and
 
03:38:02.750 --> 03:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
their family could uh that's one here
 
03:38:04.790 --> 03:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
thing here that's explicitly for the
 
03:38:06.790 --> 03:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
military um the other thing is it's a
 
03:38:08.309 --> 03:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
lot like a driver's license one is if
 
03:38:09.429 --> 03:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
you move to another state you have to
 
03:38:11.590 --> 03:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
get a new driver's license
 
03:38:14.590 --> 03:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
and also if you look at page 10 at the
 
03:38:17.389 --> 03:38:17.399 align:start position:0%
top um let's say you've got a license in
 
03:38:19.710 --> 03:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
Louisiana but you're practicing in New
 
03:38:22.229 --> 03:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um you have to follow the
 
03:38:23.550 --> 03:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
rules in New
 
03:38:25.950 --> 03:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um you know even though your
 
03:38:27.750 --> 03:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
license is this compact license that
 
03:38:29.189 --> 03:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
you're using same thing as if you drive
 
03:38:31.550 --> 03:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
in another state I mean they'll accept
 
03:38:32.910 --> 03:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
your driver's license but you have to
 
03:38:34.710 --> 03:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
follow their rules
 
03:38:37.389 --> 03:38:37.399 align:start position:0%
there yeah that's that's good
 
03:38:37.399 --> 03:38:39.309 align:start position:0%
there yeah that's that's good
representative

03:38:39.309 --> 03:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:38:39.319 --> 03:38:41.870 align:start position:0%
representative
goalie

03:38:41.870 --> 03:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
goalie
 
03:38:43.750 --> 03:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I I had the same
 
03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
concerns you did about uh Revenue um
 
03:38:48.269 --> 03:38:48.279 align:start position:0%
with the number of folks coming in here
 
03:38:50.950 --> 03:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
um and with the licensing fees that we
 
03:38:53.910 --> 03:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
could possibly lose um because at first
 
03:38:56.550 --> 03:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
it sounded like they could shop around
 
03:38:58.189 --> 03:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
for probably the cheapest license fee
 
03:38:59.590 --> 03:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
and go to that state and then just come
 
03:39:01.110 --> 03:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
back here to New Hampshire to practice
 
03:39:02.990 --> 03:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
for a little while and move on somewhere
 
03:39:06.070 --> 03:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
else um is my concern but I think in
 
03:39:07.870 --> 03:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
hearing this
 
03:39:10.429 --> 03:39:10.439 align:start position:0%
um we ought to put something in and we
 
03:39:12.590 --> 03:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
look further into these compacts that if
 
03:39:14.070 --> 03:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
we are going to have people coming into
 
03:39:14.990 --> 03:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who are part of the
 
03:39:17.189 --> 03:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
compact I think they should be charged
 
03:39:18.710 --> 03:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
the fee I don't know if they are now I
 
03:39:21.269 --> 03:39:21.279 align:start position:0%
don't believe they are but we need to
 
03:39:22.670 --> 03:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
look into that and I think it needs to
 
03:39:26.469 --> 03:39:26.479 align:start position:0%
be done let me um give you an example of
 
03:39:28.870 --> 03:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
the fee that a fee that is charged the
 
03:39:31.830 --> 03:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
PT board has basically the same thing so
 
03:39:33.429 --> 03:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
what they did is they looked at what the
 
03:39:36.830 --> 03:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
compact commission was charging was I I
 
03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
believe they were
 
03:39:39.239 --> 03:39:40.950 align:start position:0%
believe they were
charging

03:39:40.950 --> 03:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
charging
 
03:39:43.870 --> 03:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
$50 and so the PT board said okay
 
03:39:46.030 --> 03:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
they're paying $50 to the compact
 
03:39:47.309 --> 03:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
they're going to pay New Hampshire for
 
03:39:48.830 --> 03:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
their privileged
 
03:39:51.750 --> 03:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
$6 we don't have as much paperwork to do
 
03:39:53.630 --> 03:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
and we don't have as much of that type
 
03:39:56.590 --> 03:39:56.600 align:start position:0%
of thing to do so we charged less for
 
03:39:58.750 --> 03:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
the privilege but we're still getting
 
03:40:01.110 --> 03:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
that revenue for every time they renew
 
03:40:02.750 --> 03:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
their license they have to renew their
 
03:40:05.070 --> 03:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
compact privilege so every two years
 
03:40:07.229 --> 03:40:07.239 align:start position:0%
just like everybody else so if anything
 
03:40:10.189 --> 03:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
happens there's that money coming in to
 
03:40:14.030 --> 03:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
cover some of those costs is that um how
 
03:40:15.510 --> 03:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
is that fee established is that
 
03:40:18.030 --> 03:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
established through room making um who
 
03:40:19.830 --> 03:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
who sets the fee what's the process for
 
03:40:23.389 --> 03:40:23.399 align:start position:0%
that that we set it in rule making so is
 
03:40:25.870 --> 03:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
that rule uh compact rule making or is
 
03:40:27.309 --> 03:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
that regular rul making that the
 
03:40:28.990 --> 03:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
legislature would have oversight through
 
03:40:32.150 --> 03:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
jail car I believe because I think I did
 
03:40:35.150 --> 03:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
it it was through jail car and it was
 
03:40:38.189 --> 03:40:38.199 align:start position:0%
set within the PT board's New Hampshire
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
rules okay and one followup Mr chair yes
 
03:40:47.590 --> 03:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
please um I noticed in this bill and the
 
03:40:50.990 --> 03:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
language of the compact um
 
03:40:53.950 --> 03:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
there's uh cost associated with this
 
03:40:57.510 --> 03:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
organization and um the ability to
 
03:41:01.269 --> 03:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
collect fees to help pay for the costs
 
03:41:02.750 --> 03:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to hear a little more about
 
03:41:05.269 --> 03:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
how that is taken care of and what the
 
03:41:05.279 --> 03:41:07.750 align:start position:0%
how that is taken care of and what the
structure

03:41:07.750 --> 03:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
structure
 
03:41:12.510 --> 03:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:15.870 --> 03:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
I was going to defer to Susan I can try
 
03:41:20.110 --> 03:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
to answer that um so the the the compact
 
03:41:22.429 --> 03:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
commission does have the ability to
 
03:41:24.550 --> 03:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
assess states of fee to be part of the
 
03:41:27.070 --> 03:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
Compact and that's to help fund the work
 
03:41:29.950 --> 03:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
of the commission itself um and creating
 
03:41:32.389 --> 03:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
that database maintaining all the
 
03:41:35.309 --> 03:41:35.319 align:start position:0%
information um covering comp uh
 
03:41:36.910 --> 03:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
commission meetings there's like a
 
03:41:40.870 --> 03:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
yearly commission meeting um so the
 
03:41:43.349 --> 03:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
compact does have the ability to assess
 
03:41:46.990 --> 03:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
that fee but what that fee is and if
 
03:41:48.950 --> 03:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
there will be an assessment is really up
 
03:41:51.670 --> 03:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
to the compact commission um I know that
 
03:41:54.349 --> 03:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
for this compact we've we've already
 
03:41:57.189 --> 03:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
talked about looking at Grants um that
 
03:41:58.910 --> 03:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
we could possibly get to help fund You
 
03:42:00.590 --> 03:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
Know cover a lot of those costs so that
 
03:42:04.429 --> 03:42:04.439 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have to assess the states um
 
03:42:06.110 --> 03:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
so those are things you know we would
 
03:42:08.990 --> 03:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
look at you know federal grants DOD now
 
03:42:13.030 --> 03:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
has a grant um to help fund compacts um
 
03:42:14.710 --> 03:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
so we would be looking at things like
 
03:42:17.110 --> 03:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
that I know that I believe it's the
 
03:42:19.510 --> 03:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
nursing compact does
 
03:42:23.630 --> 03:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
not assess States and I think that the
 
03:42:25.630 --> 03:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
and Tina correct me if I'm wrong I think
 
03:42:29.469 --> 03:42:29.479 align:start position:0%
that the PT compact does assess States
 
03:42:32.070 --> 03:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
now not that I know of I don't think
 
03:42:34.110 --> 03:42:34.120 align:start position:0%
that there's no they aren't assessing
 
03:42:35.710 --> 03:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
they're going on what they're making off
 
03:42:39.070 --> 03:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
of the the compact privileges okay yeah
 
03:42:40.870 --> 03:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
so I think it's you know right now I
 
03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
don't know that any states then are
 
03:42:42.479 --> 03:42:43.550 align:start position:0%
don't know that any states then are
actually

03:42:43.550 --> 03:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:42:46.070 --> 03:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
assessing um or any compacts are
 
03:42:48.630 --> 03:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
assessing States let's assume that they
 
03:42:50.469 --> 03:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
did though let's assume that because we
 
03:42:52.510 --> 03:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
they have the authority to they assess a
 
03:42:55.269 --> 03:42:55.279 align:start position:0%
feat in the Hampshire where did those
 
03:42:57.750 --> 03:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
funds come from um and and how would
 
03:42:59.070 --> 03:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
they be
 
03:43:00.990 --> 03:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
appropriated I think that would just be
 
03:43:03.510 --> 03:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
up to the to to you guys to decide who
 
03:43:05.149 --> 03:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
would pay that fund you know would it
 
03:43:07.990 --> 03:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
come out from a general a g general fund
 
03:43:10.510 --> 03:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
would it come from the board specific Al
 
03:43:12.429 --> 03:43:12.439 align:start position:0%
I think different states handle it
 
03:43:15.070 --> 03:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
differently um so it would it would
 
03:43:17.229 --> 03:43:17.239 align:start position:0%
depend on how you guys want to handle
 
03:43:19.309 --> 03:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
that it just seems a little difficult
 
03:43:21.349 --> 03:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
for for the legislature to say that
 
03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
we're it's basically a blank check um
 
03:43:25.469 --> 03:43:25.479 align:start position:0%
because they can set whatever they want
 
03:43:26.950 --> 03:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
and then we have to find a way to fund
 
03:43:29.229 --> 03:43:29.239 align:start position:0%
it later on that's a little concerning
 
03:43:31.830 --> 03:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
um Mr bradrick you had your hand up well
 
03:43:34.550 --> 03:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
I was just gonna add that so um op PLC
 
03:43:36.750 --> 03:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
boards there are four boards that belong
 
03:43:41.070 --> 03:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
to compacts uh PT I think medicine
 
03:43:45.670 --> 03:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
um psychology and one other nursing
 
03:43:49.469 --> 03:43:49.479 align:start position:0%
obviously um if the subcommittee would
 
03:43:51.269 --> 03:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
like I'm happy to go back to our finance
 
03:43:53.429 --> 03:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
person and figure out if any of them are
 
03:43:55.469 --> 03:43:55.479 align:start position:0%
charging and how much it's being charged
 
03:43:57.469 --> 03:43:57.479 align:start position:0%
right now I'll also just point out that
 
03:44:00.950 --> 03:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
oplc is self-funded um so we don't get
 
03:44:04.590 --> 03:44:04.600 align:start position:0%
funds from the general fund um if I
 
03:44:06.630 --> 03:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
would imagine if
 
03:44:09.469 --> 03:44:09.479 align:start position:0%
uh we started getting charged a fee from
 
03:44:12.030 --> 03:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
a compact commission we could Implement
 
03:44:13.870 --> 03:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
rules similar to what Tina had said and
 
03:44:16.429 --> 03:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
charge the people coming in to get the
 
03:44:19.750 --> 03:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
privilege to practice um a fee that
 
03:44:22.870 --> 03:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
would cover the compact commission fee
 
03:44:25.550 --> 03:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
um that's just one way it could be done
 
03:44:27.870 --> 03:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
but yeah I wanted to point out the money
 
03:44:29.269 --> 03:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be coming from the general fund
 
03:44:32.070 --> 03:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's opl's
 
03:44:34.750 --> 03:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
self-funded I I agree that oplc self
 
03:44:36.910 --> 03:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
funded but this statute doesn't seem to
 
03:44:38.469 --> 03:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
say that the money is going to come from
 
03:44:41.070 --> 03:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
oplc so so that it kind of leaves it up
 
03:44:42.309 --> 03:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
in the air where the money is going to
 
03:44:44.269 --> 03:44:44.279 align:start position:0%
come from which would only leaves the
 
03:44:46.830 --> 03:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
general fund um and since we have no
 
03:44:49.870 --> 03:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
idea what that fee is um you know is it
 
03:44:53.830 --> 03:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
$1,000 is it $50,000 I mean it's
 
03:44:57.710 --> 03:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
um seem to rec call that nursing might
 
03:44:57.720 --> 03:45:00.389 align:start position:0%
um seem to rec call that nursing might
charge

03:45:00.389 --> 03:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
$6,000 and per state per state but and
 
03:45:06.349 --> 03:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
and we've had you know I've had talks
 
03:45:10.070 --> 03:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
about this with with CSG you know and
 
03:45:12.670 --> 03:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
granted it's not in writing anywhere but
 
03:45:15.349 --> 03:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
I we would not be able to charge more
 
03:45:19.030 --> 03:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
than nursing charges as just a matter of
 
03:45:21.670 --> 03:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
Common Sense almost um you know nursing
 
03:45:23.429 --> 03:45:23.439 align:start position:0%
is the biggest compact out there they
 
03:45:27.710 --> 03:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
have the most members um it would not do
 
03:45:29.349 --> 03:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
be good for us and it wouldn't be good
 
03:45:31.590 --> 03:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
for states to charge more than what they
 
03:45:31.600 --> 03:45:32.750 align:start position:0%
for states to charge more than what they
would

03:45:32.750 --> 03:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:45:36.510 --> 03:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
charge go ahead Senator I I I would be
 
03:45:39.510 --> 03:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely open to an amendment that
 
03:45:41.670 --> 03:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
that put the responsibility for handling
 
03:45:45.309 --> 03:45:45.319 align:start position:0%
those charges on oplc so that you know
 
03:45:47.070 --> 03:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
so that it is self-funded it's not
 
03:45:49.189 --> 03:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
impacting the general
 
03:45:51.710 --> 03:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
fund I I appreciate that I was actually
 
03:45:53.469 --> 03:45:53.479 align:start position:0%
about to suggest that I think that's a
 
03:45:55.710 --> 03:45:55.720 align:start position:0%
good idea I think that other states have
 
03:45:57.910 --> 03:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
done that just so that we're not tying
 
03:45:59.750 --> 03:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
future legislators to a bill that we
 
03:46:00.950 --> 03:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what it
 
03:46:05.149 --> 03:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:08.229 --> 03:46:08.239 align:start position:0%

things that these folks can do and it
 
03:46:57.159 --> 03:46:57.830 align:start position:0%
things that these folks can do and it
kind

03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
kind
 
03:47:00.229 --> 03:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
of puts a little makes you step back a
 
03:47:02.070 --> 03:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
little bit wondering um with all these
 
03:47:04.149 --> 03:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
things they can do um who's overseeing I
 
03:47:07.269 --> 03:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
know the commission board commission Who
 
03:47:10.269 --> 03:47:10.279 align:start position:0%
was appointed uh overseeing
 
03:47:14.229 --> 03:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
but um looking at the budget and uh the
 
03:47:15.990 --> 03:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
states that are going to be paying who's
 
03:47:18.550 --> 03:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
going to be actually be overseeing this
 
03:47:21.950 --> 03:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:24.070 --> 03:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
ense representative goalie I would
 
03:47:26.030 --> 03:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
mention that that is actually standard
 
03:47:27.830 --> 03:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
language it's in the nursing Compact and
 
03:47:31.710 --> 03:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
the PT compact um as for who will be
 
03:47:34.070 --> 03:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
overseeing the whole thing the the
 
03:47:36.830 --> 03:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
compact commission um so every state who
 
03:47:38.790 --> 03:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
is a member of the compact will have two
 
03:47:38.800 --> 03:47:40.229 align:start position:0%
is a member of the compact will have two
members

03:47:40.229 --> 03:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
members
 
03:47:42.870 --> 03:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
um represent their state one audiologist
 
03:47:44.910 --> 03:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
and one speech language pathologist and
 
03:47:46.349 --> 03:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
they they will be the ones who will make
 
03:47:49.189 --> 03:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
all of the decisions um there will be an
 
03:47:51.469 --> 03:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
executive committee that will be uh
 
03:47:55.030 --> 03:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
voted into existence by those compact uh
 
03:47:56.950 --> 03:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um just to see to the
 
03:47:59.910 --> 03:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
day-to-day operations of the compact but
 
03:48:02.830 --> 03:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
it is it is really uh an instrumentality
 
03:48:04.990 --> 03:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
of the state the compact commission is
 
03:48:07.030 --> 03:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
really an instrumentality of the state
 
03:48:08.750 --> 03:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
um and every all the decisions will be
 
03:48:12.910 --> 03:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:16.070 --> 03:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
follow are they going to have a
 
03:48:18.349 --> 03:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
centralized office for these folks going
 
03:48:20.550 --> 03:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
to be from their home States and working
 
03:48:22.469 --> 03:48:22.479 align:start position:0%
via zoom and holding meetings that way
 
03:48:24.790 --> 03:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
or how do that take place I mean in the
 
03:48:26.349 --> 03:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
beginning it's probably going to be a
 
03:48:29.189 --> 03:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
volunteer position uh to take over I
 
03:48:31.309 --> 03:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
know that the nursing commission uh just
 
03:48:34.030 --> 03:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
got their first real employee that they
 
03:48:37.269 --> 03:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
pay um within the last couple of years
 
03:48:38.830 --> 03:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
so in the beginning it's just going to
 
03:48:40.030 --> 03:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
be volunte
 
03:48:42.670 --> 03:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
work of you know between the states and
 
03:48:45.030 --> 03:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
and the organizations that have um a
 
03:48:47.630 --> 03:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
stake in the in the commission um there
 
03:48:51.070 --> 03:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
won't be a paid position overseeing the
 
03:48:53.349 --> 03:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
compact there won't be office space
 
03:48:54.790 --> 03:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
anything like
 
03:48:58.189 --> 03:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
that um if I just Mr chair that and
 
03:49:00.110 --> 03:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
that's one of my concerns we're hearing
 
03:49:01.790 --> 03:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
the nursing compact has just got their
 
03:49:03.710 --> 03:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
first employee and are we starting
 
03:49:05.469 --> 03:49:05.479 align:start position:0%
something that's just going to grow and
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
cost money um as we go forward and more
 
03:49:10.510 --> 03:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
States on board and it gets bigger and
 
03:49:13.550 --> 03:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
bigger that it it's just going to be
 
03:49:16.830 --> 03:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
expanding that's my concern I hope that
 
03:49:18.910 --> 03:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
it expands I mean we we want it to be a
 
03:49:21.590 --> 03:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
50-state compact um nursing right now I
 
03:49:24.630 --> 03:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
believe is at 34 states um but again
 
03:49:26.469 --> 03:49:26.479 align:start position:0%
they have there are four million nurses
 
03:49:28.670 --> 03:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
in the country um they're one of the
 
03:49:31.269 --> 03:49:31.279 align:start position:0%
biggest occupations in this country we
 
03:49:34.590 --> 03:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
have you know Asha ourselves have only
 
03:49:38.550 --> 03:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
218,000 members um so it's it's only
 
03:49:41.790 --> 03:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
going to be able to get so big um but I
 
03:49:44.510 --> 03:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
think you know once more States join
 
03:49:46.990 --> 03:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
then we you know maybe have a the
 
03:49:49.070 --> 03:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
ability to to pull funds a little bit
 
03:49:51.469 --> 03:49:51.479 align:start position:0%
more to be able to afford those things
 
03:49:53.750 --> 03:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
it may be that the the this compact
 
03:49:56.910 --> 03:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
never has a a you know a paid employee
 
03:49:58.510 --> 03:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
that oversees it it might be done
 
03:50:01.389 --> 03:50:01.399 align:start position:0%
entirely by the executive committee um
 
03:50:03.710 --> 03:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
it just really depends on how like you
 
03:50:06.990 --> 03:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
said how big it gets um but I I can't
 
03:50:11.189 --> 03:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
see us as being big enough
 
03:50:13.670 --> 03:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
to operate in the way that the nursing
 
03:50:17.550 --> 03:50:17.560 align:start position:0%
compact operates I am I I I like the
 
03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
concept the whole concept of the compact
 
03:50:21.910 --> 03:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
think I think is great I just as
 
03:50:23.830 --> 03:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
stewards of the taxpayer funds we have
 
03:50:26.189 --> 03:50:26.199 align:start position:0%
to be really careful that we don't have
 
03:50:28.630 --> 03:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
one person whoever that may be who is
 
03:50:30.910 --> 03:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire representative on the
 
03:50:33.550 --> 03:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
committee for the compact able to commit
 
03:50:36.070 --> 03:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire um to
 
03:50:38.630 --> 03:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
expenses in other words um it says they
 
03:50:42.070 --> 03:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
can take out loans um I don't personally
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
think that there should be one person
 
03:50:44.790 --> 03:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
speaking for the State of New Hampshire
 
03:50:46.309 --> 03:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
saying yeah go ahead we approve of that
 
03:50:48.870 --> 03:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
loan um there's got to be some kind of
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
firewall to protect the taxpayers from
 
03:50:55.670 --> 03:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
being committed to something um without
 
03:50:58.750 --> 03:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
at least legislative oversight on some
 
03:51:01.590 --> 03:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
level I I I'd hate to see us getting a
 
03:51:03.030 --> 03:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
bill in the mail for something that was
 
03:51:05.670 --> 03:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
agreed to by one person that we granted
 
03:51:06.910 --> 03:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
this authority
 
03:51:09.269 --> 03:51:09.279 align:start position:0%
to well and I don't think that that
 
03:51:11.590 --> 03:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
those people the the Commissioners are
 
03:51:13.750 --> 03:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
not going to have a blank check I mean
 
03:51:15.309 --> 03:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
they're they're only going to be able to
 
03:51:17.510 --> 03:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
do what oplc tells them that they're
 
03:51:20.070 --> 03:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
going to be able to do ultimately oplc
 
03:51:21.590 --> 03:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
will be
 
03:51:23.510 --> 03:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
overseeing what goes on with the
 
03:51:25.030 --> 03:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
commission and what those Commissioners
 
03:51:28.110 --> 03:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
are allowed to do or say I I would agree
 
03:51:29.550 --> 03:51:29.560 align:start position:0%
with you because they're a
 
03:51:32.070 --> 03:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative they're not a sole
 
03:51:33.950 --> 03:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
individual acting on their own they're a
 
03:51:36.590 --> 03:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative of the state and of the
 
03:51:39.309 --> 03:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
board and they would before they would
 
03:51:40.750 --> 03:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
do anything like that they would have to
 
03:51:43.030 --> 03:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
come back and get a they can't just act
 
03:51:45.309 --> 03:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
unilaterally they'd get permission
 
03:51:47.670 --> 03:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
they'd run it by the board just like any
 
03:51:50.030 --> 03:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
other thing that they do and you can
 
03:51:54.429 --> 03:51:54.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:56.710 --> 03:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
Tom could I say something oh go ahead
 
03:51:59.070 --> 03:51:59.080 align:start position:0%
Tom go ahead I'm sorry I was just gonna
 
03:52:01.910 --> 03:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
say I think you're right Tina and I if
 
03:52:03.269 --> 03:52:03.279 align:start position:0%
this would work I I would want to make
 
03:52:05.349 --> 03:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
sure this wouldn't blow up the compacts
 
03:52:07.070 --> 03:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
I I think it wouldn't but as we
 
03:52:09.990 --> 03:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier may be room for some
 
03:52:11.630 --> 03:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
sort of amendment saying the funds have
 
03:52:13.910 --> 03:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
to come from the oplc general fund and
 
03:52:16.550 --> 03:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
maybe it could also say something like
 
03:52:21.950 --> 03:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
which those funds or the the fees we
 
03:52:25.269 --> 03:52:25.279 align:start position:0%
take in to issue these Interstate
 
03:52:27.550 --> 03:52:27.560 align:start position:0%
licenses have to cover those fees so
 
03:52:31.110 --> 03:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
we're not so we're not charging anyone
 
03:52:32.950 --> 03:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
in the state we're not charging New
 
03:52:34.990 --> 03:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire only lies we're charging the
 
03:52:36.750 --> 03:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
people that are taking advantage of the
 
03:52:39.110 --> 03:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
compact I I don't know if that's
 
03:52:42.149 --> 03:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
possible um I
 
03:52:44.429 --> 03:52:44.439 align:start position:0%
guess I know that we can't Tinker too
 
03:52:46.229 --> 03:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
much with the language of the compact or
 
03:52:48.550 --> 03:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
else it um it doesn't work with the
 
03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
other states I don't know if we can add
 
03:52:53.269 --> 03:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
funding language if we can I could bring
 
03:52:54.830 --> 03:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
it back to my executive director and see
 
03:52:56.510 --> 03:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
if she would agree and I can bring
 
03:52:59.429 --> 03:52:59.439 align:start position:0%
something back to the committee well I I
 
03:53:01.309 --> 03:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned I mean the
 
03:53:02.990 --> 03:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
language of the compact has to be what
 
03:53:06.510 --> 03:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
it is but there can be a higher level uh
 
03:53:09.630 --> 03:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
wording that says that you know anything
 
03:53:12.030 --> 03:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
uh they the compact Representatives
 
03:53:14.149 --> 03:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
can't commit to anything on behalf of
 
03:53:16.030 --> 03:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
the state without approval of of
 
03:53:18.189 --> 03:53:18.199 align:start position:0%
somebody do you follow what I'm saying I
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
don't want to mess with the language
 
03:53:21.510 --> 03:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
necessary to be in the compact but I
 
03:53:23.110 --> 03:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
want to fail safe or some type of
 
03:53:25.070 --> 03:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
firewall that says okay before anything
 
03:53:28.110 --> 03:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
is committed to um financially on behalf
 
03:53:30.670 --> 03:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire that
 
03:53:33.229 --> 03:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
there's at least more approval than than
 
03:53:34.389 --> 03:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
even than
 
03:53:37.950 --> 03:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
OPC representative leus go ahead I'm
 
03:53:37.960 --> 03:53:39.550 align:start position:0%
OPC representative leus go ahead I'm
sorry

03:53:39.550 --> 03:53:39.560 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:53:43.030 --> 03:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I mean next because I yeah she
 
03:53:44.870 --> 03:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
did have her hand up okay I'm sorry go
 
03:53:47.189 --> 03:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
ahead go ahead Jackie I'm sorry I'm just
 
03:53:49.469 --> 03:53:49.479 align:start position:0%
trying to Neal out what the issues are
 
03:53:53.149 --> 03:53:53.159 align:start position:0%
because between all of us I think that
 
03:53:56.710 --> 03:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
if we look at we understand how we
 
03:53:58.349 --> 03:53:58.359 align:start position:0%
license within our
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
state right so and and that we feel very
 
03:54:03.510 --> 03:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
comfortable because we feel we have
 
03:54:06.229 --> 03:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
control over that the licensing fees pay
 
03:54:09.830 --> 03:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
for the um the the uh operation of the
 
03:54:14.229 --> 03:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
committee of the board is that right yes
 
03:54:16.990 --> 03:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
there's no and so the issue that I think
 
03:54:19.590 --> 03:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
the that what we're trying to understand
 
03:54:24.149 --> 03:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
is um and then and we already have had
 
03:54:27.269 --> 03:54:27.279 align:start position:0%
legislation that as a policy has allowed
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
us to have con compacts in four
 
03:54:35.710 --> 03:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
other practices
 
03:54:40.309 --> 03:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
correct and why are we so I'm asking
 
03:54:44.910 --> 03:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
myself why is it that now how is this
 
03:54:47.149 --> 03:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
compact different from the other
 
03:54:50.429 --> 03:54:50.439 align:start position:0%
ones and what can you tell us about
 
03:54:50.439 --> 03:54:51.429 align:start position:0%
ones and what can you tell us about
these

03:54:51.429 --> 03:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:54:53.670 --> 03:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
compacts that
 
03:54:57.710 --> 03:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
will um answer the question on our in
 
03:55:00.309 --> 03:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
our mind about how this is if we know
 
03:55:03.070 --> 03:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
for example that this compact is going
 
03:55:06.070 --> 03:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
to work similarly to the other
 
03:55:09.910 --> 03:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
ones is it drastically different is it
 
03:55:13.349 --> 03:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
identical is it similar I think this is
 
03:55:16.590 --> 03:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
the thing that we need to because we've
 
03:55:19.830 --> 03:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
we've entered in compacts before so how
 
03:55:21.670 --> 03:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
is this compact different from other
 
03:55:25.070 --> 03:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
compacts and do the other compacts have
 
03:55:27.469 --> 03:55:27.479 align:start position:0%
we incurred fees you know have we
 
03:55:30.469 --> 03:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
incurred costs for those compacts and if
 
03:55:33.550 --> 03:55:33.560 align:start position:0%
so how what were they
 
03:55:36.149 --> 03:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
addressed well I can say that this these
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
two compacts were modeled after the the
 
03:55:41.550 --> 03:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
PT compact they are I wouldn't say
 
03:55:43.990 --> 03:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
they're exact but they're very similar
 
03:55:46.590 --> 03:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
and that boilerplate language with
 
03:55:50.670 --> 03:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
regards to um the commission and all of
 
03:55:54.149 --> 03:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things are the
 
03:55:57.429 --> 03:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
same and we have not run into fees with
 
03:56:00.630 --> 03:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
that PT compact now the nursing compact
 
03:56:04.030 --> 03:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
that's been in existence for a long time
 
03:56:06.349 --> 03:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
if they're charging the $6,000 that's
 
03:56:09.389 --> 03:56:09.399 align:start position:0%
been decided upon and they've and I'm
 
03:56:13.269 --> 03:56:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:15.590 --> 03:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
them well you see this is the thing
 
03:56:17.149 --> 03:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
because you don't because we need
 
03:56:19.149 --> 03:56:19.159 align:start position:0%
somebody who knows the answers to these
 
03:56:20.990 --> 03:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
things this is the thing and I don't
 
03:56:23.710 --> 03:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
know who that person is who is that
 
03:56:26.630 --> 03:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
person so I've emailed on the the
 
03:56:29.870 --> 03:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
finance question I've emailed our um
 
03:56:31.750 --> 03:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
Director of Finance to see if he can
 
03:56:34.830 --> 03:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
pull four the four compacts that oplc
 
03:56:36.469 --> 03:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
belongs to and I believe there's some
 
03:56:38.189 --> 03:56:38.199 align:start position:0%
compacts that other agencies belong to
 
03:56:40.630 --> 03:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
but I'm talking about oplc are we
 
03:56:42.590 --> 03:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
charged anything and how much because I
 
03:56:44.389 --> 03:56:44.399 align:start position:0%
think that would be very helpful to you
 
03:56:46.229 --> 03:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
um I just emailed him when we first
 
03:56:48.189 --> 03:56:48.199 align:start position:0%
discussed this 15 minutes ago and I
 
03:56:51.309 --> 03:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
haven't heard back um so on that piece
 
03:56:53.189 --> 03:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
you know we can get you that
 
03:56:56.830 --> 03:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
answer um as far as comparing this to
 
03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
other compacts uh Tina is correct my
 
03:57:02.550 --> 03:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is this is most similar to
 
03:57:05.149 --> 03:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
the PT compact um they're all very
 
03:57:07.630 --> 03:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
similar I haven't gone through line by
 
03:57:10.590 --> 03:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
by line to to match them up and see how
 
03:57:14.630 --> 03:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
they're different um you know I I can do
 
03:57:18.950 --> 03:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
that if the committee wants to see um
 
03:57:18.960 --> 03:57:20.070 align:start position:0%
that if the committee wants to see um
see

03:57:20.070 --> 03:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:57:23.469 --> 03:57:23.479 align:start position:0%
this representative Roy um yeah I know
 
03:57:26.870 --> 03:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
that Dan logston from CSG is is on the
 
03:57:30.389 --> 03:57:30.399 align:start position:0%
call um maybe if you are can bring him
 
03:57:33.030 --> 03:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
into this he he'll be able to shed some
 
03:57:35.309 --> 03:57:35.319 align:start position:0%
more light on on the
 
03:57:37.590 --> 03:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
questions okay I just promoted into
 
03:57:37.600 --> 03:57:39.830 align:start position:0%
questions okay I just promoted into
panelist

03:57:39.830 --> 03:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
panelist
 
03:57:40.950 --> 03:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh in the meantime representative
 
03:57:46.229 --> 03:57:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:49.630 --> 03:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
while uh so I appreciate the opportunity
 
03:57:52.830 --> 03:57:52.840 align:start position:0%
to weigh in a little bit because I I I
 
03:57:54.349 --> 03:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
understand that there's some skepticism
 
03:57:57.070 --> 03:57:57.080 align:start position:0%
there's due diligence involved in the
 
03:57:59.710 --> 03:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's questioning and
 
03:58:02.830 --> 03:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
deliberation but uh just just a couple
 
03:58:05.469 --> 03:58:05.479 align:start position:0%
of things that those of us who've been
 
03:58:07.630 --> 03:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
on the committee for a while uh can
 
03:58:09.189 --> 03:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps contribute that's what I'm going
 
03:58:12.229 --> 03:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
to try and do in my remarks uh and that
 
03:58:15.229 --> 03:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
is first of all as American citizens we
 
03:58:17.149 --> 03:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
have the free right of movements within
 
03:58:19.750 --> 03:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
the United States right uh we we can
 
03:58:23.429 --> 03:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
move any to any state at any time uh
 
03:58:27.229 --> 03:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
just as I came here 35 years ago roughly
 
03:58:30.229 --> 03:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
um and so I've been a taxpayer and a
 
03:58:31.870 --> 03:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
contributor to the state of New
 
03:58:34.590 --> 03:58:34.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all along um I haven't been a
 
03:58:37.309 --> 03:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
burden on the state uh hope I won't ever
 
03:58:39.910 --> 03:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
be a burden on the state on other
 
03:58:42.429 --> 03:58:42.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um but the bottom line is
 
03:58:45.189 --> 03:58:45.199 align:start position:0%
everybody has a freedom of movement uh
 
03:58:47.189 --> 03:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
and and the idea that we're suddenly
 
03:58:48.870 --> 03:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
gonna there was a remark the question
 
03:58:50.429 --> 03:58:50.439 align:start position:0%
raised earlier about we're going to be
 
03:58:52.790 --> 03:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
flooded with people coming up from
 
03:58:57.950 --> 03:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
Louisiana well my answer is what's the
 
03:59:00.030 --> 03:59:00.040 align:start position:0%
draw to come to New
 
03:59:02.030 --> 03:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of the things that this
 
03:59:04.790 --> 03:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
committee has been doing for virtually
 
03:59:06.990 --> 03:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
the entire time that I've been on it 15
 
03:59:10.670 --> 03:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
years is we've been trying to work for
 
03:59:13.389 --> 03:59:13.399 align:start position:0%
better standards of reciprocity and so
 
03:59:16.110 --> 03:59:16.120 align:start position:0%
forth so that we can get people that we
 
03:59:19.550 --> 03:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
need in this state that is a matter that
 
03:59:22.590 --> 03:59:22.600 align:start position:0%
is not being sufficiently understood
 
03:59:25.750 --> 03:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
here I believe is that when we want it
 
03:59:28.429 --> 03:59:28.439 align:start position:0%
when we have a shortage of nurses or
 
03:59:30.950 --> 03:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
physical therapists or whatever the need
 
03:59:34.710 --> 03:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
is then we want people to come here to
 
03:59:38.429 --> 03:59:38.439 align:start position:0%
do those jobs because we need them and
 
03:59:40.309 --> 03:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
and to the degree that the compacts
 
03:59:43.110 --> 03:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
enable us to get people who are trained
 
03:59:46.990 --> 03:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
skilled and so forth to come here then
 
03:59:48.870 --> 03:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
that's to our advantage and we've been
 
03:59:51.510 --> 03:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
doing trying to do that for
 
03:59:53.870 --> 03:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
years um so the idea that we're going to
 
03:59:55.990 --> 03:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
have people come sleding up here that
 
03:59:58.229 --> 03:59:58.239 align:start position:0%
must mean that there is a tremendous
 
04:00:00.550 --> 04:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
boom in the New Hampshire
 
04:00:02.750 --> 04:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
economy I don't think it's very likely
 
04:00:04.070 --> 04:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
that we're going to get a tremendous
 
04:00:06.670 --> 04:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
boom but there certainly has been growth
 
04:00:09.110 --> 04:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire economy for most of
 
04:00:13.229 --> 04:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
my 35 years here uh and we've also had
 
04:00:16.630 --> 04:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh additional people moving in mostly
 
04:00:16.640 --> 04:00:18.110 align:start position:0%
uh additional people moving in mostly
from

04:00:18.110 --> 04:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:00:21.750 --> 04:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts not from Louisiana um and
 
04:00:23.110 --> 04:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
they're right across the border there
 
04:00:24.790 --> 04:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
are a lot of them that have settled
 
04:00:25.990 --> 04:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
across the border and become New
 
04:00:28.309 --> 04:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens and
 
04:00:31.349 --> 04:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh and and if they came and
 
04:00:33.670 --> 04:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
started a business uh then they're
 
04:00:36.870 --> 04:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
contributing to the tax base uh property
 
04:00:39.630 --> 04:00:39.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and so forth and so on this is
 
04:00:42.269 --> 04:00:42.279 align:start position:0%
all to the benefit of the New Hampshire
 
04:00:46.630 --> 04:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
economy if you subscribe to the e to the
 
04:00:50.110 --> 04:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
theory that all economic growth is good
 
04:00:52.269 --> 04:00:52.279 align:start position:0%
then you want ought to want more people
 
04:00:54.550 --> 04:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
now the idea that we're going to have be
 
04:00:57.349 --> 04:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
flooded with anybody I think is not the
 
04:01:00.269 --> 04:01:00.279 align:start position:0%
real world unless there is a tremendous
 
04:01:02.349 --> 04:01:02.359 align:start position:0%
demand and if there's a tremendous
 
04:01:04.790 --> 04:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
demand then we need those people to come
 
04:01:07.269 --> 04:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
here to meet that demand and one of the
 
04:01:09.309 --> 04:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
things we know on this committee those
 
04:01:11.429 --> 04:01:11.439 align:start position:0%
of who's been here for a while is that
 
04:01:13.469 --> 04:01:13.479 align:start position:0%
we have a tremendous need in mental
 
04:01:16.510 --> 04:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
health in nursing and in other
 
04:01:19.870 --> 04:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
especially medical Fields so this
 
04:01:23.590 --> 04:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
compact is going to enable us to meet
 
04:01:26.149 --> 04:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
some of those needs and the compact
 
04:01:28.149 --> 04:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
Theory and principle is one that's well
 
04:01:30.030 --> 04:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
established it's been working in the
 
04:01:31.710 --> 04:01:31.720 align:start position:0%
state with the with regard to some of
 
04:01:34.229 --> 04:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
these professions for some time and we
 
04:01:36.429 --> 04:01:36.439 align:start position:0%
we we don't see the state tilting into
 
04:01:38.950 --> 04:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
the ocean because to me and many people
 
04:01:41.990 --> 04:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
have come flooding in uh and so
 
04:01:43.750 --> 04:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative representative Schmid
 
04:01:45.790 --> 04:01:45.800 align:start position:0%
with with all due respect I think we
 
04:01:47.550 --> 04:01:47.560 align:start position:0%
we've established that we kind of like
 
04:01:48.990 --> 04:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
the idea of the compact we're talking
 
04:01:51.790 --> 04:01:51.800 align:start position:0%
about a the nuts and bolts of it and um
 
04:01:54.309 --> 04:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
I think the rep the Louisiana was just
 
04:01:56.469 --> 04:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
an example of a state where someone
 
04:01:59.870 --> 04:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
could come from do you have anything add
 
04:02:02.309 --> 04:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
I take your point Mr chairman and and I
 
04:02:05.349 --> 04:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
and I said in my initial statement that
 
04:02:07.630 --> 04:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
the skepticism and the due diligence is
 
04:02:11.269 --> 04:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate but some of the ideas uh
 
04:02:15.389 --> 04:02:15.399 align:start position:0%
strike me more as being you know over
 
04:02:18.790 --> 04:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
suspicious as if we are the first state
 
04:02:21.389 --> 04:02:21.399 align:start position:0%
to try this or as if we have never dealt
 
04:02:23.630 --> 04:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
with any other kind of compact before
 
04:02:26.070 --> 04:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
our experience has been good that's why
 
04:02:28.790 --> 04:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to expand it so I
 
04:02:31.269 --> 04:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to share my
 
04:02:33.189 --> 04:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
thoughts with the with the committee
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:39.389 --> 04:02:39.399 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair and I'll be
 
04:02:41.510 --> 04:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
real brief I just wanted to respond to
 
04:02:43.710 --> 04:02:43.720 align:start position:0%
that uh there was no influx of
 
04:02:45.790 --> 04:02:45.800 align:start position:0%
louisianans coming up here uh that was
 
04:02:47.429 --> 04:02:47.439 align:start position:0%
statement was not made uh in this
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
hearing but I also just want to remind
 
04:02:51.389 --> 04:02:51.399 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt that when folks
 
04:02:53.630 --> 04:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
do come here and as he just stated uh
 
04:02:55.550 --> 04:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
moving up here from Massachusetts or
 
04:02:57.710 --> 04:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
wherever um out of state and moving to
 
04:02:59.670 --> 04:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that we heard earlier in
 
04:03:01.149 --> 04:03:01.159 align:start position:0%
this hearing that once they become a
 
04:03:02.710 --> 04:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
resident they will be getting a New
 
04:03:05.229 --> 04:03:05.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license so the compact really
 
04:03:08.229 --> 04:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't involve those cases thank you
 
04:03:10.189 --> 04:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
okay thanks all right let's let's move
 
04:03:12.870 --> 04:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
along our representative
 
04:03:17.750 --> 04:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
leus um thank you Mr chair um you know
 
04:03:20.149 --> 04:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
first of all I I do um want to make it
 
04:03:22.429 --> 04:03:22.439 align:start position:0%
easy for people to practice uh wherever
 
04:03:24.469 --> 04:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
and to move if they want um I'm
 
04:03:26.429 --> 04:03:26.439 align:start position:0%
generally supportive of this um but I
 
04:03:28.550 --> 04:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
think it's part of due diligence we need
 
04:03:31.870 --> 04:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
to you know look at it with open eyes
 
04:03:33.670 --> 04:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
and understand what's going on and you
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
had uh some comments about having some
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
control over what happened
 
04:03:40.830 --> 04:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
um especially things that might generate
 
04:03:44.710 --> 04:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
fees and I think you know basically if
 
04:03:46.070 --> 04:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to do this we need we need
 
04:03:49.229 --> 04:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
to depend on the commission being
 
04:03:51.750 --> 04:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable um you know even if we put
 
04:03:53.070 --> 04:03:53.080 align:start position:0%
some restrictions on what our
 
04:03:55.429 --> 04:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
Representatives chose to do um they're
 
04:03:57.550 --> 04:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
going to be just uh two votes on this
 
04:03:59.790 --> 04:03:59.800 align:start position:0%
and um they could vote against it and
 
04:04:02.189 --> 04:04:02.199 align:start position:0%
there still could be you know let's say
 
04:04:05.710 --> 04:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
some large fees assessed um and that's
 
04:04:08.790 --> 04:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
true and um you know I definitely
 
04:04:10.790 --> 04:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
support if we can do it an amendment to
 
04:04:13.389 --> 04:04:13.399 align:start position:0%
say that uh you know this has to be paid
 
04:04:15.670 --> 04:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
for by oplc and and you know part of the
 
04:04:17.710 --> 04:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
whole self funding thing and there's a
 
04:04:20.070 --> 04:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism where we can uh
 
04:04:23.469 --> 04:04:23.479 align:start position:0%
charge um you know the people who are
 
04:04:26.309 --> 04:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
practicing here under the compact for it
 
04:04:31.510 --> 04:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
um but uh but in the end um you know we
 
04:04:34.110 --> 04:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
can't have any kind of absolute control
 
04:04:35.550 --> 04:04:35.560 align:start position:0%
I don't think where the legislature
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
control um what they do
 
04:04:40.830 --> 04:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
but and but I think that's you know the
 
04:04:42.550 --> 04:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
experience shows that that hasn't been a
 
04:04:44.950 --> 04:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
problem in other compacts and I'm okay
 
04:04:47.630 --> 04:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
with that agree thank you uh
 
04:04:47.640 --> 04:04:48.830 align:start position:0%
with that agree thank you uh
representative

04:04:48.830 --> 04:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:04:52.389 --> 04:04:52.399 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you Mr chair um just a quick
 
04:04:56.510 --> 04:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
aside um representative Schmidt asking
 
04:04:58.309 --> 04:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
what's the draw for people from
 
04:05:00.590 --> 04:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
Louisiana I just promised them that they
 
04:05:04.590 --> 04:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:07.510 --> 04:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
22nd uh but I wanted to put forward if
 
04:05:10.469 --> 04:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
if it wouldn't uh violate the
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
langage um for the compact something
 
04:05:16.189 --> 04:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
along the lines of a statement any
 
04:05:19.670 --> 04:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
expenses agreed to within the compact by
 
04:05:22.269 --> 04:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
our representative shall be covered by
 
04:05:25.950 --> 04:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
oplc funds something along those lines
 
04:05:25.960 --> 04:05:26.950 align:start position:0%
oplc funds something along those lines
just

04:05:26.950 --> 04:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:05:28.950 --> 04:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
suggesting yeah I think we all pretty
 
04:05:31.389 --> 04:05:31.399 align:start position:0%
much agree with that that that would
 
04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
satisfy a lot of the uh Financial
 
04:05:36.550 --> 04:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
concerns we have Mr uh logon you wanted
 
04:05:39.149 --> 04:05:39.159 align:start position:0%
to uh weigh in
 
04:05:42.229 --> 04:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh uh yes uh if if if folks would like
 
04:05:44.269 --> 04:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
me to I just made some notes and
 
04:05:46.670 --> 04:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate um the opportunity to speak
 
04:05:49.110 --> 04:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
with you all today um just to recap the

glad to be of service to you uh the

national Center for interstate compacts
 
04:06:12.269 --> 04:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
um has been working on all these
 
04:06:14.229 --> 04:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
existing ler compacts in one form or
 
04:06:16.510 --> 04:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
another so just quickly someone ask
 
04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
about the differences I mean all these
 
04:06:20.149 --> 04:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
lure compacts are similar in Form and
 
04:06:22.269 --> 04:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
Function um there's essentially two
 
04:06:23.830 --> 04:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
kinds so the medical compact is
 
04:06:25.550 --> 04:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
expedited lier you're actually getting
 
04:06:27.910 --> 04:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
licensed into the states in an expedited
 
04:06:29.710 --> 04:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
manner the all the other ones are what's
 
04:06:32.309 --> 04:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
called Mutual recognition compacts so
 
04:06:34.550 --> 04:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
your home state license is being
 
04:06:37.030 --> 04:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
mutually recognized by the other compact
 
04:06:39.229 --> 04:06:39.239 align:start position:0%
member states the nursing compacts works
 
04:06:41.710 --> 04:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
just like your driver's license uh when
 
04:06:44.910 --> 04:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
PT uh was developing uh their compact
 
04:06:46.950 --> 04:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that uh the folks
 
04:06:48.750 --> 04:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
developing that wanted a little bit more
 
04:06:50.990 --> 04:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
visibility on who was in their states
 
04:06:52.710 --> 04:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
and also what they heard from their
 
04:06:55.229 --> 04:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
state boards uh was that we're concerned
 
04:06:56.950 --> 04:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
about Revenue law so we'd like a
 
04:06:59.389 --> 04:06:59.399 align:start position:0%
mechanism uh to be able to you know
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
potentially claw back some of that
 
04:07:02.229 --> 04:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
Revenue I don't know if that exact
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
phrase was used but that's the the the
 
04:07:05.830 --> 04:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
result of it and so they came up with
 
04:07:08.550 --> 04:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
this privileged to practice model and um
 
04:07:10.149 --> 04:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
the all the professions that we've been
 
04:07:12.469 --> 04:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
working with subsequently have
 
04:07:14.149 --> 04:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
gravitated toward that because it does
 
04:07:16.149 --> 04:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
give the state boards the ability to
 
04:07:17.910 --> 04:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
charge a fee for that uh compact
 
04:07:19.630 --> 04:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
privilege and recover some of that
 
04:07:23.110 --> 04:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue um so that that's one point I
 
04:07:26.710 --> 04:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to make again um the back half of
 
04:07:29.710 --> 04:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
all these compacts are very similar um
 
04:07:31.269 --> 04:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
because they rely on that same boiler
 
04:07:35.070 --> 04:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
plate language um and as far as the
 
04:07:36.389 --> 04:07:36.399 align:start position:0%
assessments go I just want to address
 
04:07:38.429 --> 04:07:38.439 align:start position:0%
that you know New Hampshire is a member
 
04:07:41.229 --> 04:07:41.239 align:start position:0%
of a lot of compacts that assess New
 
04:07:44.710 --> 04:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire U not sure where uh the the
 
04:07:46.830 --> 04:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
the end result of that money comes from
 
04:07:49.830 --> 04:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
but um uh you're a member of the uh uh
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
the juvenile compact the compact for
 
04:07:53.469 --> 04:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
juvenile offenders the interstate
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
compact for adult offender supervision
 
04:07:57.710 --> 04:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
uh the military children's compact
 
04:08:00.030 --> 04:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
commission uh the Emergency Management
 
04:08:05.429 --> 04:08:05.439 align:start position:0%
assistance compact um and um uh the uh
 
04:08:07.870 --> 04:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
and then all of the ler compact so uh
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know in our work with these lure
 
04:08:12.870 --> 04:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
compacts and you know this absolutely is
 
04:08:15.269 --> 04:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
something uh uh that I think speaks to
 
04:08:16.830 --> 04:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
to what you're talking about here you
 
04:08:18.990 --> 04:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
know I think the goal of all these
 
04:08:21.469 --> 04:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
compacts are to be self- sustaining and
 
04:08:25.269 --> 04:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
to rely on assistance from um board
 
04:08:26.790 --> 04:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
organizations national board
 
04:08:28.590 --> 04:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
organization and National membership
 
04:08:30.990 --> 04:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
organizations but yes there there is
 
04:08:33.109 --> 04:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
that assessment language there because
 
04:08:36.269 --> 04:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
we insist on it this benefits the states
 
04:08:38.030 --> 04:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
um we're not encouraging an assessment
 
04:08:39.189 --> 04:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
toward the states but it would be
 
04:08:41.510 --> 04:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
irresponsible to create something like
 
04:08:43.710 --> 04:08:43.720 align:start position:0%
an interstate compact commission which
 
04:08:45.429 --> 04:08:45.439 align:start position:0%
is an instrumentality of the states it's
 
04:08:48.389 --> 04:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
a quasa governmental agency it's Supra
 
04:08:50.189 --> 04:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
state but it's subf Federal and it's
 
04:08:52.910 --> 04:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
accountable to the state so um without
 
04:08:54.670 --> 04:08:54.680 align:start position:0%
you know having having that assessment
 
04:08:56.349 --> 04:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
but I think their all of their intention
 
04:08:59.149 --> 04:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
is is to limit as much as possible any
 
04:09:01.550 --> 04:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
assessment on the states um and
 
04:09:03.389 --> 04:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
certainly just something about I know
 
04:09:05.109 --> 04:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk about you
 
04:09:06.670 --> 04:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
know these folks are empowered to speak
 
04:09:09.309 --> 04:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
on on behalf of our state um you know
 
04:09:11.189 --> 04:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
what kind of recourse do we had and
 
04:09:13.070 --> 04:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
another uh speaker really hit it on the
 
04:09:14.910 --> 04:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
head I mean these are public meetings
 
04:09:16.910 --> 04:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
the agendas will be published well in
 
04:09:18.910 --> 04:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
advance um you know the compact
 
04:09:20.670 --> 04:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
Commissioners aren't just going to show
 
04:09:22.189 --> 04:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
up at the meeting and get presented with
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
something and vote on it um you know the
 
04:09:26.550 --> 04:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
the agencies that appoint the
 
04:09:28.109 --> 04:09:28.119 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are going to have
 
04:09:29.750 --> 04:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
visibility on what's going to happen at
 
04:09:31.109 --> 04:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
the meetings and we'll instruct their
 
04:09:33.229 --> 04:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
delegates uh at least this is how it
 
04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
happens with the other compacts I don't
 
04:09:35.670 --> 04:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
know why it wouldn't happen with this
 
04:09:37.950 --> 04:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
one they'll instruct their delegates uh
 
04:09:39.910 --> 04:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
how to proceed and how to vote and you
 
04:09:42.590 --> 04:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
know this compact like all of them um
 
04:09:44.349 --> 04:09:44.359 align:start position:0%
you know this is an extreme remedy but
 
04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
but they do have a withdraw provision so
 
04:09:49.229 --> 04:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
um you know this isn't the the Hotel
 
04:09:51.229 --> 04:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
California I mean you you can check out
 
04:09:53.389 --> 04:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
and you can actually leave uh at some
 
04:09:56.030 --> 04:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
point you're not you have to meet your
 
04:09:59.429 --> 04:09:59.439 align:start position:0%
obligations but um but if the compact
 
04:10:00.790 --> 04:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
commission was to do something so
 
04:10:02.309 --> 04:10:02.319 align:start position:0%
honorous that the legislature in New
 
04:10:04.030 --> 04:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire said that's it we're getting
 
04:10:06.590 --> 04:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
out you can get out you have to get out
 
04:10:08.950 --> 04:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
the same way you joined but but there is
 
04:10:10.950 --> 04:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
is that uh is that provision there's
 
04:10:12.229 --> 04:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
also a lot of Provisions around
 
04:10:14.550 --> 04:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
mediation uh that that we would hope uh
 
04:10:17.630 --> 04:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
States would take advantage of so uh end
 
04:10:19.790 --> 04:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
though but this is an instrumentality of
 
04:10:21.750 --> 04:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
the states it's accountable to the
 
04:10:24.309 --> 04:10:24.319 align:start position:0%
states um and you know you have the
 
04:10:27.550 --> 04:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
power to uh provide as much oversight as
 
04:10:30.870 --> 04:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
as you wish to provide okay thank you
 
04:10:32.389 --> 04:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
secretary if I could ask a quick
 
04:10:35.630 --> 04:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
question and that is Mr logon uh um
 
04:10:36.910 --> 04:10:36.920 align:start position:0%

director of the national Center for
 
04:10:45.630 --> 04:10:45.640 align:start position:0%
interstate compacts at the Council of
 
04:10:47.910 --> 04:10:47.920 align:start position:0%

muted right so does your organization or
 
04:11:04.710 --> 04:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
do these all these compacts that we
 
04:11:09.830 --> 04:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
belong to do they send out annual
 
04:11:12.990 --> 04:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
reports that's a great question um yes
 
04:11:15.670 --> 04:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh they well they compile and ex uh uh
 
04:11:17.070 --> 04:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
the reports and they're provided to
 
04:11:20.229 --> 04:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
their state commissioner now um whether
 
04:11:22.189 --> 04:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
it's provided to the legislature I can't
 
04:11:24.429 --> 04:11:24.439 align:start position:0%
speak speak to representative but yes
 
04:11:26.950 --> 04:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
the large National compacts like the
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
interstate compact for adult offender
 
04:11:31.590 --> 04:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
supervision and the juvenile Compact and
 
04:11:33.269 --> 04:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
the military children's Compact and the
 
04:11:35.550 --> 04:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management compact uh and the
 
04:11:37.030 --> 04:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
interstate compact for the placement of
 
04:11:38.349 --> 04:11:38.359 align:start position:0%
children which deals with kids and
 
04:11:40.750 --> 04:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
Foster Care uh they all put together
 
04:11:42.910 --> 04:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
annual reports if you Google them you
 
04:11:44.910 --> 04:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
can find their websites and get access
 
04:11:46.990 --> 04:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
to those reports if it would be helpful
 
04:11:50.830 --> 04:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
I can certainly um um uh get links and
 
04:11:52.389 --> 04:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
send those over to you all as well could
 
04:11:54.469 --> 04:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
you please send those to us because I
 
04:11:56.109 --> 04:11:56.119 align:start position:0%
this is important information that we
 
04:11:59.229 --> 04:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
need to know I me I had no I had no idea
 
04:12:02.030 --> 04:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
that we we belong to so many compacts
 
04:12:03.389 --> 04:12:03.399 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be a good place it
 
04:12:06.109 --> 04:12:06.119 align:start position:0%
would be good for a place to keep that
 
04:12:09.510 --> 04:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
on our State website sure absolutely
 
04:12:11.109 --> 04:12:11.119 align:start position:0%
thank you and just to respond to what
 
04:12:14.149 --> 04:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
you said about um Mr Lon about the we
 
04:12:16.469 --> 04:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
belong to so many compacts I guess the
 
04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
difference is the uh on this particular
 
04:12:21.349 --> 04:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
one um I'm chairing the subcommittee and
 
04:12:23.269 --> 04:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to sign up on something
 
04:12:25.389 --> 04:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
until I know what it's going to cost us
 
04:12:27.469 --> 04:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
um but having said that I think that
 
04:12:30.590 --> 04:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
we've come to a a quasi consensus that
 
04:12:32.790 --> 04:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
um we need some language that says
 
04:12:35.590 --> 04:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
opsc is going to be responsible for any
 
04:12:38.349 --> 04:12:38.359 align:start position:0%
fees generated by this

04:13:11.910 --> 04:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
executive director I do not see her
 
04:13:14.469 --> 04:13:14.479 align:start position:0%
having an issue with this but um I'll
 
04:13:15.990 --> 04:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
get on a call with her after this
 
04:13:17.910 --> 04:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
meeting some something very simple short
 
04:13:21.670 --> 04:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
sweet any fees that are required uh as a
 
04:13:23.269 --> 04:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
as a condition of our membership in this
 
04:13:26.309 --> 04:13:26.319 align:start position:0%
compact will be funded by the oplc and
 
04:13:29.109 --> 04:13:29.119 align:start position:0%
um just to be clear if I may um I know
 
04:13:30.990 --> 04:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
we've been primarily talking about the
 
04:13:33.510 --> 04:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
first compact in this lead uh this bill
 
04:13:35.830 --> 04:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
the speech language pathology Audiology
 
04:13:38.389 --> 04:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
there's also that the nearly identical
 
04:13:42.149 --> 04:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
OT compact um you want that to cover
 
04:13:44.550 --> 04:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
both yeah I would I'm basically treating
 
04:13:46.269 --> 04:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
these as the same thing just different
 
04:13:48.870 --> 04:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
professions but the nuts and bolts of it
 
04:13:51.070 --> 04:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
um that we're responsible for should be
 
04:13:54.750 --> 04:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:57.710 --> 04:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
same okay check we also get uh from them
 
04:13:58.750 --> 04:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
if there's any fees that we are
 
04:14:00.269 --> 04:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
currently paying into these compacts as
 
04:14:02.910 --> 04:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:05.950 --> 04:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
are yeah if anyone has that information
 
04:14:07.590 --> 04:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
I would like to see that as well what
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
what we're currently paying um in
 
04:14:12.550 --> 04:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
compact fees and how they're being paid
 
04:14:14.590 --> 04:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
um that would be great so do you think
 
04:14:16.790 --> 04:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
we can get all this together um within a
 
04:14:19.950 --> 04:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
week Mr brri absolutely I I um I just
 
04:14:21.830 --> 04:14:21.840 align:start position:0%

04:14:24.189 --> 04:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
language we might be able to tweak so I
 
04:14:26.070 --> 04:14:26.080 align:start position:0%

04:14:30.710 --> 04:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
