the issues in executive session I'm
 
00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
going to open up a couple of these bills
 
00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
and not take any motions we're going to
 
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
have some discussion first we've done
 
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
that many times in education policy
 
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
where we have concerns where we can draw
 
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
upon technical support if we need it and
 
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
then I will then announce when I'm ready
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
to take motions and I will address
 
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
somebody to make a motion after we have
 
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
this discussion first we break into
 
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
caucuses where we meet as a caucus
 
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
either side and try to determine okay
 
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
with this new information we gathered
 
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
where is your team going to be and
 
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 align:start position:0%
they'll come back and I'll take a motion
 
00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
and we'll move on with it and so
 
00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 align:start position:0%
starting out in today's ad do right here
 
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
we have five bills or let's see am I
 
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
looking at the right one four bills
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
no I'm looking at the wrong sheet
 
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
here uh
 
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.070 align:start position:0%
here uh
bye

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
bye
 
00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 align:start position:0%
bills and I'd like to open up for
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
discussion purposes for the HB
 
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
443 so let's turn to that bill and I did
 
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
have a discussion this morning earlier
 
00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:45.639 align:start position:0%
before I had go to another meeting with
 
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
the folks over at
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
nhti with Shannon Reed working with Mark
 
00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.759 align:start position:0%
Rubenstein Mark Rubenstein is the chair
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
of that particular uh commission um
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
regarding this Bill and as you recall
 
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
the bill reads terms the appointed
 
00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
members on the commission we're talking
 
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
about except as otherwise indicated
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
above shall be for five years and it's
 
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
striking out and until a successor is
 
00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:17.479 align:start position:0%
appointed in qualified vacancy shall be
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
filled for the unexpired
 
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
term we had discussion about that during
 
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
the hearing process and there was some
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
question as far as uh you know uh
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
um the people that are going beyond
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
their appointed time beyond the five
 
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
years but haven't been reappointed or
 
00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
nobody else has been uh appointed
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
pursuant to executive councel and
 
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
governor and so those people continue
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
even though they're now living down in
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
Arizona and have nothing to do with the
 
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
college that they're supposedly supposed
 
00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
to be representing on this
 
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:02.360 align:start position:0%
commission so um the question being then
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh where do we go with with this bill in
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to amend it to be more
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
clearly understood that you're going to
 
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
be representing that
 
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
college and attending meetings regularly
 
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
or whatever it may be and if you miss
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
for example hypothetically three in a
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
row or something without being an
 
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
excused absence are you kicked off um
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
and does that have to be put in
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
legislation or not um so I asked um I
 
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
talked with uh the folks at nhti that
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
share this thing because the remember
 
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
the chancellors are on this of the
 
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
colleges we also have the presidents of
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
the of of the uh colleges and then we
 
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
also have the private Council the
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
council uh uh M M M um what's his name
 
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
Stark um the Dartmouth College all the
 
00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
privates in the state they also have
 
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
representation and they wanting to get
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
involved with this somehow
 
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
um so I I'm I'm going to open this up to
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
discussion right now if there's
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
questions let's try to get these things
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
answered they're willing to come over
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
and work with us on if we don't want
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
this is not an early Bill if we need
 
00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:17.079 align:start position:0%
more information on that we can do that
 
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
um I just want to make sure that we're
 
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
understanding what the purpose of this
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
commission is what do they do and is
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
this something that Doe is going to have
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
be able to do in place of them um
 
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
I have concerns that Doe is not going to
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
be able to do that there's there it's
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
really comprehensive what they do in
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
reviewing those people want to come in
 
00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:41.079 align:start position:0%
and open up a higher education
 
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
institution in this state it's very
 
00:09:45.069 --> 00:09:45.079 align:start position:0%
complex and we're not doing it for
 
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:47.240 align:start position:0%
international schools as we once did
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
that was presented by uh Mr applebe so
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's open for discussion right now not
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
taking any kind of motions if there's
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
question yet repesent papovich thank you
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um since this is an executive
 
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
session I'll keep it really short I will
 
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
say that it seems
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
that this bill is not ready to be exact
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm fine just not really taking any
 
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
action right now and um creating a work
 
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
session and figuring out which way we go
 
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:17.240 align:start position:0%
from the work session but in terms of
 
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
one quick suggestion given that my
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the meetings are
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
regularly scheduled twice a year for the
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
commission if we are going to have a
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
number of unexcused absences that
 
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
trigger this probably the highest I
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
would support would be two because
 
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
that's already one year of the seat
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
basically being vacant
 
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
unofficially but again we can I'm fine
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
just waiting until it's time because we
 
00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
we still have strategic directions to
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
decide on
 
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
this the the number of times they meet
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
really depends upon what they have in
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
their plate coming atams first those
 
00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
people that are under review or on
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
conditional approval or those which are
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
coming for initial approval if they're
 
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
coming in for new initial approval they
 
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
oftentimes meet
 
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
monthly uh to review these applications
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
looking into the finances of the people
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
and also the uh the standards in which
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
their their staff that are going to be
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
working there are going to be bound to
 
00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
so I I I like the suggestion just not
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
doing anything on it today it's not an
 
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:24.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.829 --> 00:11:28.839 align:start position:0%
Ames first I I agree that uh it would
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
make sense to hold this
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
and have a work session and deal with it
 
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
but uh I would say that I think what
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
what's presented here is a uh very
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
narrow problem that relates to terms of
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
a particular category of uh the group
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
that is on the board here um and trying
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
to make that trying to deal with a
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
problem that Mak you know sounds like a
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
real problem and um so that's one thing
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
and that's what the bill presents I
 
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
think the broader question that has been
 
00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:12.279 align:start position:0%
raised about the purpose of this
 
00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:13.509 align:start position:0%
raised about the purpose of this
commission

00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:12:16.829 --> 00:12:16.839 align:start position:0%
and uh how it fits into the higher
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
education public higher education
 
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
Enterprise in New Hampshire is a a
 
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
question that's really not gerain to
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill and uh we can go into it
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
sure but uh it's it's going Beyond
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
what's presented here in the
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
bill and uh rep have yeah thank you very
 
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and and um and you know
 
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
similar you know I I was having thoughts
 
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
very similar to what representative Ames
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
was just um um just
 
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
discussing um but I do think I mean I I
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
I agree with the um you know with the
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
thoughts that um that representative pav
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
Mueller put on the table in terms of um
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
maybe um you know not acting on this
 
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
bill today so that we can consider what
 
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
the larger uh situation and if a non-
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
gerain amendment can be introduced maybe
 
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
that's something uh we we would want to
 
00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
hold a hearing on and move forward with
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
or not so but um but I I agree there I
 
00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:24.519 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a reason to um to to
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
to act today on so what I'd like to do
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
is I'd like to put a small sub committee
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
together uh of folks which will like to
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
work with higher education the we've had
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh the uh chair of this
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
commission support that and we also have
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
folks from the privates which would like
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
to come in and and yes that's widening
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
the scope of what this bill is uh but we
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
have to first deal with this issue of
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
the vacancies and are they going to be
 
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
filled and are they working with all
 
00:13:57.949 --> 00:13:57.959 align:start position:0%
those people or is it a few people the
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
college presidents making these
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
decisions uh if the other appointed
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
people don't
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
show and I don't know that I don't know
 
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
what the history of it is so I just like
 
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
to defer this action today put together
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
a small subcommittee to have them come
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
back um prior and have that report come
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
back to us prior to the date that this
 
00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:19.399 align:start position:0%
has to be out of the committee has to be
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
out by March 20th so we would have a
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee come back with a
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations to us and we go with it
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
there is there any opposition to doing
 
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
that not seeing any no I just wanted to
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
add a
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
comment go ahead I just wanted to say
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
that one of my concerns is the fact that
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
the governor is making these these
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
appointments and so I think we need to
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
look at the um regulations that are
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
related to governor and Council
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
appointments because maybe we can't
 
00:14:49.949 --> 00:14:49.959 align:start position:0%
change it here it might conflict with
 
00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
something that's there well it's it's in
 
00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:55.759 align:start position:0%
our statute which we write uh that it's
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
done by governor and councel uh we can
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
change any anything we want that's in
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
there it's our prerogative so we're the
 
00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
legislature we are a separate Branch
 
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
totally from the governor so those are
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
words that are music to my
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
ears okay so we're going to bypass on
 
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
this right now and go to the the next
 
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
bill which we had in the dock which is
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
484 and this is Rel to reallocation and
 
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
repurposing of Career and Technical
 
00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:25.959 align:start position:0%
education classroom Space by local
 
00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:27.069 align:start position:0%
education classroom Space by local
school

00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:27.079 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
districts here's what I got again from
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
the uh director of uh Career Technical
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
education this morning on on the
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
telephone on the cell
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
phone I understand and I've read the
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
information regarding where where
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
Milford is on this right now and having
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
to try to uh use this space which has
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
been CTE space for 20
 
00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
years and then utilizing that space uh
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
going forward here in their uh
 
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
repurposing and use of that space um
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
it's he's he's of the opinion that if in
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
fact you have a space such as that
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
that's been used by CTE that you want to
 
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
have a general education class come in
 
00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
and teach within that classroom
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
space it's okay if in fact you're still
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
using it on the other part of the day
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
for a Health Sciences class which is
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
wrapped up in those CTE clusters program
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
so it's a shared space that they said if
 
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
if if in fact you're going for that
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
grant money which you know would be the
 
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
$ 13.7 million which is a state share um
 
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
that of I think the total project Gary
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong was around $28
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
million 23 and she's been reduced by the
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
state that's right so go down to 23 and
 
00:16:59.470 --> 00:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
so you're looking at you know then the
 
00:17:03.029 --> 00:17:03.039 align:start position:0%
9.9 having to come up from a local Bond
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
um that uh this
 
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.470 align:start position:0%
um that uh this
legislation

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh may not really have an impact one way
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
or the other on it other words there
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
he's saying if you're going to continue
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
to use it for CTE even though you're
 
00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:18.919 align:start position:0%
going to be using it also for General Ed
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
and you have some uh deferred
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
maintenance in there they that's not
 
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
going to stop them from getting their
 
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
Grant they may you may be hearing
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
something different but uh so at at this
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
point in time that's what I got back
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
they're also saying over the doe right
 
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
now that there is a a group with the
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility of giving a report in May
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
of this this year dealing with how we're
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
going to do Capital Improvements and
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the programs and CTE right
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
now right now it's it's the always the
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
next two projects Milford and ringe Jeff
 
00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
this this go around and then then we get
 
00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
down to the bottom of the list here we
 
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
will be then starting a new process and
 
00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:03.799 align:start position:0%
they're coming out with a report how to
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
allocate dollars to do that and uh that
 
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
that study group report comes out in May
 
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned and with there'll
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
probably be new rules and everything
 
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
associated with so we're going to be
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
just jumping how we do things here very
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
shortly here should we wait till then um
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
if this is imperative and that we really
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
need it to allow them to have a CTE
 
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
program I'm open to doing anything to
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
help a CTE program I'll tell you right
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
there I will always vote in support of a
 
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
CTE program so open for a discussion
 
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
yeah D
 
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair based
 
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
on your presentation it seems
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
that while you know this may not
 
00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily be needed or solve the exact
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
problem there doesn't seem to be any
 
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
harm in just passing it and then
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
adjusting it based on the report of the
 
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
commission or what not in the next year
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
I mean I think I would rather do
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
something this is a rather innocuous and
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
harmless bill that may help I don't
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
think there is any harm in you know
 
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
oding it if needed and you know then
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
continue to survey the landscape and see
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
if more action is needed but I wouldn't
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
want to not do anything when something
 
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
can be done just to wait for more
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
day yeah
 
00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:24.919 align:start position:0%
yes I I am of the
 
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
same um opinion as you that anything
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
that we can do to help help the CTE
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
programs would be something that we need
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
to do um this wouldn't just help the CTE
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
programs this also would help the
 
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
regular Ed programs I think that it's
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
that we can I think that we should um
 
00:19:48.149 --> 00:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
put this through as ought to pass and
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
then wait for the committee report to
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
come out and next year if something
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
different needs to happen something
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
different needs to happen so I would I
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
would say the same thing as represent
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
said thank you yeah if if I'm
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
understanding the situation that conal
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
was facing um last this past fall when
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
they were looking at
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
expanding the way I understood it is
 
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
they wanted to build a new CTE Center on
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
the school and they wanted to move it
 
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
into a different location and they
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to repurpose their current CTE
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
Center for classroom space so this bill
 
00:20:31.149 --> 00:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
would actually help them be able to do
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
that because I think as things stand now
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
they would not have been able to do that
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
and would have had to demolish that old
 
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
CTE Center and build a brand new center
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
so this would have preserved that space
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
to be repurposed for other things and
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
allowed them the ability to apply for
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
the the grant they chose not to at the
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
time but um or since but it would have
 
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
allowed them to be able to build a brand
 
00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
new CTE Center and still preserve this
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
area MH
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
yes represent luno thank you um Mr chair
 
00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.190 align:start position:0%
yes represent luno thank you um Mr chair
so

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:09.549 --> 00:21:09.559 align:start position:0%
um in in some conversations I've had
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
with um with with a former CT director
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
outside of um the the committee room
 
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
although he has testified here before uh
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
there are there there are at least a
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
couple other situations across the state
 
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
involving CTE space potentially unused
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
CTE space in the need for um for
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
non-ct high school classes to or
 
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
interest among non-ct High School class
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
or High School courses to um to to use
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
some unused uh CTE space but I think um
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
from from from you know uh uh from the
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
conversations I've had not all of these
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
situations are the same and uh or would
 
00:21:59.789 --> 00:21:59.799 align:start position:0%
be covered by the language that's in the
 
00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
current um bill that's in in front of us
 
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
here and um and so uh and and and also I
 
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
think some of the the um
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
the I'm I'm I'm not sure how much this
 
00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:17.799 align:start position:0%
committee um uh knows about what the
 
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
specific situation in Milford um is
 
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
either and and you know I'm just looking
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
at at a memo that I got from from the
 
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
former CTE director I he wres I asked if
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
they could explain something about the
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
chemistry Labs which he seemed to focus
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
on um then they mentioned a c biotech
 
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
room that the high school not CTE was
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
using initially built through the CTE
 
00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:45.799 align:start position:0%
renovation build sponsored by the state
 
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
so so not quite sure where things you
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
know stand on the ground in Milford but
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
also in um I believe North Conway and
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
Claremont also have um situations that
 
00:22:59.549 --> 00:22:59.559 align:start position:0%
need to need to that would like to be
 
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
addressed as well I I I in the
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
discussion today I had that discussion
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
with Mr beards and he said that if
 
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to be jointly sharing and
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
using that facility it's different than
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
a facility that you're taking over
 
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
totally for general education regular
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
education so what I did um last night I
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
I just want to get this clarified I did
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
write a blur for this bill OTP blurb and
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
I want to read that for everybody right
 
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
now to hear where I'm coming because it
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
says some of the things I think that
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
that town is trying to do uh and the
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
other one that's we're dealing with je
 
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
Jeff's ringe and that's a different
 
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
situation Jeff has gotten into the
 
00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:47.799 align:start position:0%
business of doing some jaffre excuse me
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
jaffre um that's where Val is down there
 
00:23:52.029 --> 00:23:52.039 align:start position:0%
and where they're having a smaller
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
program which is sort of a a a satellite
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
to what they've had before but they're
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
trying now to bring the seat te centers
 
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
into these high schools so kids don't
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
have this travel time and we're losing a
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
lot of scheduling and all that so I'm
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
going to read this quickly this bill
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
authorizes the school district to
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
repurpose Career Technical education CTE
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
space uh after 20 years of exclusive use
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
at no cost that's in the bill this
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
change to statute will enable the
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
Milford CTE Center to move forward with
 
00:24:23.789 --> 00:24:23.799 align:start position:0%
their proposed CTE project each bium two
 
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
centers are designated at the state
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
level for CT renovation support funding
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
the Milford High School and applied
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
techn Technology Center project did
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
receive state approval but the initial
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
proposed state budget project renovation
 
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
amount of 28 million has been reduced as
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh represent uh uh uh um Daniels said to
 
00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.830 align:start position:0%
uh represent uh uh uh um Daniels said to
roughly

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
23 uh this funding reduction has
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
resulted in milford's need to reduce the
 
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
project in size and scope therefore
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
repurposing current spa space I should
 
00:24:59.710 --> 00:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
repurpose and use of the current space
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
the project includes a Motorsports
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
program facility SL classroom
 
00:25:06.389 --> 00:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
Renovations and replace and replacing
 
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
outdated CTE
 
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
equipment in addition to State support
 
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
and local funds several Milford
 
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
businesses and nonprofit organizations
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
have pledged support for the renovation
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
project through in-kind donations of
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
equipment and more 21 Milford businesses
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
have written letters of support for the
 
00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:24.039 align:start position:0%
project many which host students for
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
work-based learning uh I think this is
 
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
narrowing down to a singular project
 
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
until we get that may report done but
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
and I was also told by Jeff B beards
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
they probably will get that if they send
 
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
her application and they'll probably get
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
it anyways because they're seeing as a
 
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
shared area shared space for both uh
 
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
regular Ed and and CTE so um my
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
suggestion is we we move this thing
 
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
forward with not to
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
pass yes represent Damon thank you Mr
 
00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.149 align:start position:0%
pass yes represent Damon thank you Mr
chair

00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
so I just want to bring up for part of
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
the discussion and bringing this forward
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
because of a situation in Claremont
 
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
although I don't think it's Unique to
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
Claremont or likely to be unique in the
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
future and preface my remark by saying I
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
hugely value the CTE centers and the
 
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
need to get more students benefiting
 
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
from them however in Claremont there is
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
a situation where there is unused CTE
 
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
space because a program
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
closed the bill building is a short 5
 
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
minute walk from the high school which
 
00:26:35.549 --> 00:26:35.559 align:start position:0%
is crowded they want to be able to use
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
the unused CTE space for General Ed not
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
shared with
 
00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
CTE because they don't have a need for
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
that but actually separate for General
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
Ed so I actually frankly had intended to
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
bring forward an amendment and I
 
00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
neglected to get to that but what I
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
would put out to the committee is and
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
ask for some consideration if you look
 
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
at lines seven and 8
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
if we were to remove the words if the
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
space is being vacated to enable
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
expansion of the Career and Technical
 
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
education program that occupies the
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
space if we remove those words then we
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
are basically saying space that has been
 
00:27:15.389 --> 00:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
used by the Career Technical Center for
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
20 years can be repurposed by the
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
district so it leaves the district the
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
flexibility to use the space to the best
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
advantage of their students which is the
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
essence of local control
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
so I'd be interested to hear people's
 
00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
feedback on
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
that feedback represent
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chair sorry about
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
my voice
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm in favor of that because I
 
00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
think uh people's purposes change over a
 
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
long period of time right and so what
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
seemed like you know it was necessary 20
 
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
years ago you got to be able to have the
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
flexibility to rethink
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
at some later point so I I think that's
 
00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
reasonable and when Mr beard said to me
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
this morning yeah it may not be using
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
now so you want to repurpose it for what
 
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
you just said represent McGuire but it
 
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
may be down 10 years from then that the
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
nature of CT has changed they want to
 
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:18.039 align:start position:0%
repurpose it back to CT I think they
 
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
ought have that ability to do
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
that that's a local
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
decision reps and
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
Damon so would it be acceptable to just
 
00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
not take action on the bill this morning
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
I'll get an amendment drafted to bring
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
at when it's appropriate
 
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
scheduled any reactions from the
 
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
committee on that represent
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
papovich to be fair while I haven't
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
spent that kind of time on this that was
 
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
kind of the thought I had when I looked
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
at it it seems that after 20 years of
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
strings attached the school should have
 
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
the flexibility to use the space you
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
know 20 years is a long time things
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
change I don't want to micromanage and
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
try to guess down the road so personally
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
I would be fine with the if the space is
 
00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:04.519 align:start position:0%
being vacated and so on until he
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
occupies the space being removed and
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
just leaving the it can be
 
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
repurposed further comment yes's
 
00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
represent luno then represent fell yeah
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair yeah I'm
 
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
I'm good with uh with the idea of of of
 
00:29:22.669 --> 00:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
um waiting for an amendment and then and
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
then taking action on this but but uh uh
 
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
in between those two things I think it
 
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
would also be um be good to get um um
 
00:29:36.269 --> 00:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
director Beard's um um just feedback on
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
on the proposed amendment as well as
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
Steve Rothenberg who um you know deeply
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
involved in that I mean just to I've
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
spoken with represent be I I speak often
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
with Steve Rothenberg but and on this
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
one right here I think that we're I want
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
to see some kind of decision made now uh
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible seeing they're
 
00:29:57.389 --> 00:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
looking at March meeting coming up as
 
00:29:57.399 --> 00:29:58.590 align:start position:0%
looking at March meeting coming up as
well

00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
um so if they can see this this
 
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
supporting CT and moving something
 
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
forward I think that will may help them
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
gather the votes that they need to do
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
this sure so um I'm just saying if we
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
don't exec today you know if we exec
 
00:30:15.149 --> 00:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
this soon would be able to get the
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
amendment done and be able to get some
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
feedback if in fact we get an amendment
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
today and folks like that Amendment why
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
don't we uh take action on that later
 
00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.950 align:start position:0%
don't we uh take action on that later
today

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean sure okay so that I yes
 
00:30:34.509 --> 00:30:34.519 align:start position:0%
represent could I ask representative
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
Damon just to repeat exactly which words
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
she would be deleting in the amendment
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
yeah of
 
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:43.519 align:start position:0%
course it
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
is line seven and eight and it would be
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
taking out starting with the word if if
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
the space is being vacated to enable
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
expansion of the Career and Technical
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
education program that occupies the
 
00:30:59.629 --> 00:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
space so it's the last phrase of that s
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require a build exactly you
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
don't have to be expanding CTE to use
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
the space for other purposes that may
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
CTE represent C and then repres excuse
 
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
me represent fellows I had recognized
 
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
her earlier represent let's go across
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
there and then back to you so I just
 
00:31:24.629 --> 00:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to confirm does anybody know
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
exactly what the federal requirements
 
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
are because these are built with partly
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
with Federal money these were not built
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
with federal dollars W just State
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
dollars they were built with State
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
appropriated dollars I asked that
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
question this morning okay and then in
 
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
that case I the part that's in here um
 
00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:44.039 align:start position:0%
before um representative Damon's um
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment just the way it's
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
written now I don't understand what the
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
to yeah okay representative Co comp
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
that's well what I want clarification
 
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
noost Pap I believe it refers to the
 
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
requirement that if a school has been
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
built you would State money and you know
 
00:32:15.549 --> 00:32:15.559 align:start position:0%
it's no longer used for the purpose that
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
the school would need to refund the
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
state for all or part of the building a
 
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding of the at no
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
cost language but again you know if we
 
00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
can make a quick phone call to doe and
 
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
clarify that would be great but that's
 
00:32:29.789 --> 00:32:29.799 align:start position:0%
understanding of it the the school
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
building Aid is a different topic but we
 
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
also have that phrase in there if if
 
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to do something with that
 
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
building within that 20-year period of
 
00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
time you owe that State Building Aid
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
back to the state so we're we're
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
clarifying it here we got the same
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
20year rule in this so uh I don't think
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
that no cost makes any difference if you
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
got the 20 years already in there or or
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
or maybe it it does doesn't do any bad
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
to clarify it either so i' I'd leave it
 
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
purposes agree AG okay are we all good
 
00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:11.559 align:start position:0%
to say to represent Damon go get a
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
Amendment on
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
that thank you I'm I'm willing to
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor okay okay so so we would have
 
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
yourself represent Damon and Mr
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire is co-sponsoring
 
00:33:33.389 --> 00:33:33.399 align:start position:0%
that m a g u i r e mc mc you 5050 CH
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
okay great so we'll hang on to that and
 
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
get on to the next bill because we have
 
00:33:38.559 --> 00:33:42.190 align:start position:0%
get on to the next bill because we have
three

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:46.389 align:start position:0%
 
more

00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
um here we are okay relative the
 
00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
response via local districts to provide
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
transportation and meals for pupils in
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.669 --> 00:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
I see there's an amendment for
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
that yeah I have a proposed an amendment
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
so let's have the discussion on this
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
first okay okay
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
right uh on on the bill
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
itself do anybody any more clarification
 
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
about okay do we have anybody making a
 
00:34:21.839 --> 00:34:24.149 align:start position:0%
about okay do we have anybody making a
motion

00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
on okay so what we want to do is have a
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
brief discussion on them then we're
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
going to break in the caucus no I'm not
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
taking any
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
motions can you please reverent McGuire
 
00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
yes very simple the amendment removes
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
section two which is the section about
 
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
food but leaves section one which was
 
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
the section about
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
Transportation okay let's have some
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
discussion on that what he's doing is
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
saying that right now the law states
 
00:34:59.230 --> 00:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
that a district shall provide
 
00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:04.599 align:start position:0%
transportation for K through 8 and may
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
provide transportation to school for
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
grades 9 through 12 this came out of the
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
umberger report back in
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
2019 so this would now say that it's for
 
00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.550 align:start position:0%
2019 so this would now say that it's for
full-time

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
kindergarten uh shall provide
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
transportation for full-time kindergart
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about a halftime
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
program here so they would not have to
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
provide transp that's how I understand
 
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
am I correct on that represent McGuire
 
00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.710 align:start position:0%
am I correct on that represent McGuire
yes

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
discussion not see re
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
Damon thank
 
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
you so you all will not be surprised
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
that I do not support the amendment um I
 
00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:52.839 align:start position:0%
think it's critically important to feed
 
00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
children is very manageable for the
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
districts to have the morning and the
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon afternoon kindergarten
 
00:36:02.589 --> 00:36:02.599 align:start position:0%
children overlap and feed them one lunch
 
00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
together so the late kids came in the
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
morning kids haven't left yet it's also
 
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
good for their connecting and learning
 
00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
from each other and building for their
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
relationships as they go into first
 
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
grade when they'll be all day together
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
um so I I do not think it is valuable to
 
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
remove the nutrition component represent
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
spsb I think removing section two leaves
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
the it is
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's the other way around so so
 
00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
there's no change to
 
00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.030 align:start position:0%
there's no change to
food

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
food
 
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
creation well bricky excuse me I did you
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
both have your lights on I I think I
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
what um Mr chairman could I pass the
 
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
amendment the around does everybody have
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
a copy of the amendment no okay can you
 
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
yeah this
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
audience repent McGuire can you explain
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
it so the main thing is you can see the
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
title has changed right so the title now
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
is only about Transportation so the bill
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
is only about Transportation it's no
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
food your Amendment your amendment is
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
Del food is already in law right so
 
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
already in law they have to provide food
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
I think I understand that but I'm sorry
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair no I I recognize your
 
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
representation okay um amend the bill by
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
deleting section
 
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
two which is the
 
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
food section two is already the law if
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
words yeah so leave it as it
 
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
is so we're only talking about
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
bricky

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
bricky
 
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
so so what does it say about food it
 
00:38:59.069 --> 00:38:59.079 align:start position:0%
says that we're going to feed them no
 
00:39:01.309 --> 00:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
matter what the only reason I ask is
 
00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:04.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
um because right now um there
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
are the opposed and the online testimony
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
is uh 19 opposed and only three support
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
I think that's what it was but um it
 
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
most of them talked about the food so I
 
00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
think that that was I just want to make
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
sure that the the issue of the food is
 
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
still there and all the every single one
 
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
of the emails that I received about this
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
was really about the food so we're we're
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
sure that the food's still there repon
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
spelsbury yes you're correct so so the
 
00:39:46.109 --> 00:39:46.119 align:start position:0%
current law makes no distinction
 
00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
regarding food between half day and full
 
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
it's just pupil right all right thank so
 
00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
we're leaving that
 
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
alone ref and Luna
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair so um so
 
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
getting rid of section two um looking at
 
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:03.950 align:start position:0%
getting rid of section two um looking at
just

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
Transportation if we're going with the
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
um the wording in the bill just in in
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
section one um am I understanding this
 
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
correct that that for for um halfday um
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
kindergarten students and so usually I
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
think halfday programs will be a halfday
 
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
program in the morning and a half day
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
program in the afternoon or full day
 
00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:26.200 align:start position:0%
program that encompasses both those but
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
for the halfday kids kiddos they'd be
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
able to get a ride in in the morning but
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
no ride home um at noon or the the the
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
second half day kiddos would be able
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
would have to take a you know um you
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
know parent or guardian or friend to
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
drop them off you know at noon time and
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to catch a ride home on
 
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
the bus
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
but but um but there would be no no no
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation solution both
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
home to school and then school to home
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
for um you you'd get one half of that
 
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
but you wouldn't get the full um the
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
full Transportation that's what it says
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's that that's what that's what the
 
00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
change all right represent
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
Co yeah thank you Mr chairman the way
 
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
I'm reading this is it removes the
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
requirement but doesn't necessarily say
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
that it's disallowed so the way I'm
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
interpreting this is that school
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
districts may still contract with a
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
busing company for their halfday
 
00:41:31.309 --> 00:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
students for those rides but it's not a
 
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
requirement in law that they shall do
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
it that's
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
correct represent papovich to be very
 
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
brief it increases local control by
 
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
letting school districts decide whether
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
those programs for how they
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
kindergartens are needed or not some
 
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
districts may have very few kids and see
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
no point in you know running a bus for
 
00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:56.839 align:start position:0%
three kids I'm pretty sure that wiam
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
will continue operating the buses the
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
way they do because we have a lot of
 
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
kids and it wouldn't make any sense so
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
really you know I don't want to provide
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
a top down mandate to every school when
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
fine yes represent
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
Amon first I apologize for my confused
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
remarks on the amendment which I am fine
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
amendment however I'm not fine with the
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
basis of the bill in regards to
 
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
transportation we live in a state with
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
many many rural school
 
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
districts with many many parents who do
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
not work in the
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
community they don't have a feasible way
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
to get their kindergarten aged child to
 
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.309 align:start position:0%
to get their kindergarten aged child to
afternoon

00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
kindergarten without compromising their
 
00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:45.559 align:start position:0%
capacity to be earning a living to
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
support the family because they're not
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily working in the community
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
there are many single family single
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
parent households where it becomes even
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
more complicated to do that frankly the
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
two years that my two daughters were in
 
00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:01.720 align:start position:0%
kindergarten were the hardest years for
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
maintaining them being where they needed
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
to be getting to child care and two
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
hardworking parents trying to be where
 
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
we were supposed to be for
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
work I think it's not a very good
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
service for our
 
00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
constituents the fundamental piece of
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
education is get the kids to the site of
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
Education I don't know why we wouldn't
 
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
support that uh does anybody know what
 
00:43:28.349 --> 00:43:28.359 align:start position:0%
the definition of a full day
 
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
is um you whether I know there's number
 
00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
hours you have to have each year a
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
number of days you have to each year um
 
00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:38.559 align:start position:0%
when I've been a school principal it's
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
been if you stayed from the morning
 
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
start till after lunch that would be a
 
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
full day that's why on these snow days
 
00:43:48.549 --> 00:43:48.559 align:start position:0%
they try to hold them in there as long
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
as they can so they get credit for the
 
00:43:53.549 --> 00:43:53.559 align:start position:0%
full day am I right or wrong on
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
that okay so if you have your half day
 
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
kindergarten coming in the morning with
 
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
everybody else and going home after
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
right think so that's good
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
question well well it's considered by
 
00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
Statute a full day or by rule so if you
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
have a full day so that would mean that
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
uh those students may get a breakfast or
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
but if you wanted them there through
 
00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
lunchtime you couldn't do it if you want
 
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
to count them as as um or not provide
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
them Transportation you'd have to get
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
them out of there before the noon lunch
 
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
am I right or wrong represent luno so
 
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
it's a very good question Mr chair and
 
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe getting some clarification
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
from the Department to our our half day
 
00:44:51.069 --> 00:44:51.079 align:start position:0%
kindergarten students
 
00:44:53.309 --> 00:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
who let's say they receive
 
00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
Transportation eat lunch and then go
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
home immediately after lunch are are
 
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
they a 0.5 ADM or are they a 1.0 the
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
after and whether that's considered a a
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
halfday program or a full day program
 
00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
for virtue of of the 180 days or is it
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
um or or they considered a full day
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
student from the standpoint of
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
admr Mr chair uh attorney do you have
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
anything for us in
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
that is it wiser for us to hold on this
 
00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.589 align:start position:0%
that is it wiser for us to hold on this
bill

00:45:28.589 --> 00:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.549 --> 00:45:30.559 align:start position:0%
for you know I'm looking over here to my
 
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
right prent papovich I would suggest
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
that for me personally given that it's a
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
local control thing I don't see a need
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
to wait but I will be happy to defer if
 
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee would like
 
00:45:44.549 --> 00:45:44.559 align:start position:0%
now we're gonna break for caucus we're
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
gonna have a caucus right now and come
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
back in about five minutes Mr chair can
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
we put one more piece of information in
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
that yes M Wilson is telling us that the
 
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
full day is five hours I believe the
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
so that would go from 8 o'clock to 1:00
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
right after lunch you got your
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
instruction remember in
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
kindergarten yeah well recess is
 
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
instruction in the kindergarten
 
00:46:20.589 --> 00:46:20.599 align:start position:0%

here

00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.549 --> 00:48:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%

rep Sam McGuire thank you Mr chairman so
 
00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:56.839 align:start position:0%
I think this is a
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
quite a reasonable request um because
 
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
any children who are in half day
 
00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
kindergarten necessarily have to have
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
adult supervision for the other half of
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
the day so
 
00:55:13.789 --> 00:55:13.799 align:start position:0%
um that adult supervision should be able
 
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
transportation um and for for some
 
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
districts like the one that's requesting
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
this it's it's a very large expense with
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
not very much benefit so it should be up
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
to them what they decide to do represent
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
Pap you had the second do you have any
 
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.190 align:start position:0%
Pap you had the second do you have any
further

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
discussion any further discussion
 
00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
represent fellows um yes I'm I'm fine
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
with uh removing the second part of
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
section of the bill but in in terms of
 
00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
the first one I can't support that
 
00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
because what it does is it puts parents
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
in a difficult situation when there's a
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
halfday program and if a parent uh the
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
if a parent is working and their child
 
00:56:04.029 --> 00:56:04.039 align:start position:0%
needs to go to daycare for half a day
 
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
this makes it impossible to guarantee
 
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
that that that child can get to that
 
00:56:11.789 --> 00:56:11.799 align:start position:0%
daycare center if there's no bus
 
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
transportation for that daycare center
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
that's within the district then um the
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
parent May well choose to just not send
 
00:56:22.029 --> 00:56:22.039 align:start position:0%
their caught child to kindergarten at
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
discussion not seeing Madam clerk would
 
00:56:31.789 --> 00:56:31.799 align:start position:0%
you please call the
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
role actually can we do just on on the
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
amendment hands on the amendment oh we
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
can do that too so all those in support
 
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
of the amendment and the amendment
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
number is
 
00:56:45.839 --> 00:56:47.510 align:start position:0%
number is
03458

00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
03458
 
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
supportive supportive of the amendment
 
00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
all those
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
opposed so it's
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
unanimous okay now we have the motion uh
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
would you please make a motion for
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%

00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
Maguire yes so
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
moved Mr second representative
 
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
otpa not yes repesent
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
luno thanks for much Mr chair so
 
00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I think we've
 
00:57:34.029 --> 00:57:34.039 align:start position:0%
learned in this committee is a a lot of
 
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
us have personal stories to tell because
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
at some point we were all connected with
 
00:57:41.069 --> 00:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
schools whether they were Public Schools
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
or private schools or kids in public
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
schools or on school buses or eating
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
school lunches or everything everybody's
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
got a personal story uh to tell and and
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
um as to I so so um uh both our kids
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
went to uh went to public schools from
 
00:58:02.349 --> 00:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
first grade through uh through 12th
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
grade and um uh but they didn't do
 
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
kindergarten in public school why
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
because back then Hopkinson only offered
 
00:58:14.349 --> 00:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
half day programs and um my wife and I
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
needed a full day solution to um um uh
 
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
to kindergarten and um and in fact we
 
00:58:23.789 --> 00:58:23.799 align:start position:0%
needed a full day solution that not only
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
started at um at between 7 and 8:00 uh
 
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
in the morning but also included an
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
after school program and I think uh you
 
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
know we may have gotten penalized a
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
dollar a minute if we were late pickup
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
after 6 o' but um but um but we were
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
both early in our careers at that uh at
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
that time and it would have been
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely impossible for us to um to
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
drop them off any later or pick them up
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
any uh any earlier uh than that and um
 
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
and uh uh but but it came at quite a
 
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:03.799 align:start position:0%
cost for us for us to do that and I
 
00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
think back then the tuition was probably
 
00:59:08.589 --> 00:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't remember what it was but
 
00:59:11.309 --> 00:59:11.319 align:start position:0%
but you know we're talking you know it
 
00:59:15.309 --> 00:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
you know tens of you know a $10,000
 
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
chunk um uh for that but it allowed us
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
to move on with our careers you know I I
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
just think about how how important that
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity is for for young families
 
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
and we want them obviously to to be able
 
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
to do the best they can for themselves
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
and for their for their kids but but if
 
00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:41.799 align:start position:0%
if they're not able to uh to pick up
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
their kids or drop off their kids midday
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh or they're not able to get their kids
 
00:59:50.589 --> 00:59:50.599 align:start position:0%
to an after school program because a lot
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
of these buses the bus now in Hopkinson
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
when it um when it um when it pick picks
 
01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
up kids um to bring them home also stops
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
at after school programs to to drop the
 
01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
kids off but if you're not able to um uh
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
to do that it's um and and and for a lot
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
of people too across the state
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
transportation's an issue and transport
 
01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
personal transportation's an issue not
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
everybody has a driver's license not
 
01:00:21.029 --> 01:00:21.039 align:start position:0%
everybody has access to uh to a vehicle
 
01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
and uh not everybody lives um right next
 
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:24.839 align:start position:0%
to others that they might be able to
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
carpool uh in in a in a convenient way
 
01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
but um but you know what we have here in
 
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
is not compulsory attendance for
 
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
kindergarten we do have compulsory
 
01:00:38.829 --> 01:00:38.839 align:start position:0%
attendance I think grades 1 through 12
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
is not required for kindergarten and for
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
parents that are that are going to find
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
a hardship to uh to to get their kids to
 
01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
kindergarten or complete inability to do
 
01:00:51.789 --> 01:00:51.799 align:start position:0%
that it leaves them with only one option
 
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's a good option for the
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
kid I don't think students I don't think
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
it's a good option for families I don't
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
think it's a good option for the state
 
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
cuz we know when when uh when when our
 
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
kids don't go to kindergarten that they
 
01:01:04.589 --> 01:01:04.599 align:start position:0%
enter first
 
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
graded behind behind not ready so um so
 
01:01:13.029 --> 01:01:13.039 align:start position:0%
I uh I I you know I I I just can't
 
01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:16.119 align:start position:0%
support uh this what's what's left to
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and unfortunately I think
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
during the during the hearing and during
 
01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
during comments the um the the
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
the everything seemed be focused on the
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
um the school meal the nutrition piece
 
01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.039 align:start position:0%
and uh and not the transportation piece
 
01:01:33.549 --> 01:01:33.559 align:start position:0%
had this bill just focused on
 
01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
eliminating midday Transportation or
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
incomplete transportation for half day
 
01:01:40.349 --> 01:01:40.359 align:start position:0%
kindergarten kids I don't think this
 
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
bill would be going anywhere further
 
01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
discussion rapan
 
01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
papovich I just want to briefly say on
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
the record especially for the Watchers
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
that may be confused that this bill does
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
not prohibit that transportation from
 
01:01:58.349 --> 01:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
being provided schools that feel the
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
need for it will continue to do it
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
because it is allowed it mer merely
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
removes a mandate which is a burden to
 
01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
the districts that do not need that
 
01:02:11.069 --> 01:02:11.079 align:start position:0%
Transportation thank you and I will just
 
01:02:14.349 --> 01:02:14.359 align:start position:0%
add a last comment in here that the
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
current law says no Transportation has
 
01:02:20.829 --> 01:02:20.839 align:start position:0%
to be provided if they're within 2 miles
 
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
of the school but most districts do
 
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
provide transportation because they're
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
concern for the health the Safety and
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
Security of kids and so this is a local
 
01:02:33.069 --> 01:02:33.079 align:start position:0%
decision and I believe that a local
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
school board will make the right
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
decision um to do the transportation one
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
last comment who wants to make that last
 
01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
comment on your side FS good represent
 
01:02:45.309 --> 01:02:45.319 align:start position:0%

kindergarten
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
children is cost effective
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
of our society because kids who have
 
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
kindergarten need less Services when
 
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
they enter first grade so for all the
 
01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
reasons stated working parents health
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
and safety of children very valid but
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
truly this is an economic benefit to our
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
school systems it's not a huge sum of
 
01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:23.240 align:start position:0%
money leaving it to local control is
 
01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
defaulting to the halves and the Have
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
Nots again the communities that have
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
resources will continue to provide

discussion yeah very very briefly uh
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
when I'm looking at that fiscal note
 
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
where we're talking
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
1.19 million FY 26 and another million
 
01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.630 align:start position:0%
1.19 million FY 26 and another million
in

01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
27 uh we' We've looked at gifted
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
talented bills before and uh this is
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
coming very inexpensively for gifted
 
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
talented bills usually it's up closer to
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
$3 to $7 million
 
01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
um and um it's it's uh I don't believe
 
01:06:33.309 --> 01:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
this is the year which even though I've
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
always presented legislation in this
 
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
area of education and I think it's
 
01:06:42.269 --> 01:06:42.279 align:start position:0%
important uh that this is not the year
 
01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:45.640 align:start position:0%

01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.719 --> 01:19:53.629 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:19:53.629 --> 01:19:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.639 --> 01:20:23.629 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
going to go ahead now with the couple
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
hearings which we have scheduled for the
 
01:21:13.709 --> 01:21:13.719 align:start position:0%
latter part of the morning here uh HB
 
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
739 is the one up right now this is Rel
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
to excess funds paid to municipalities
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
for the use of school
 
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
districts and I'd like to welcome
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury to the
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
education funding
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
committee well it's familiar territory
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
isn't it thank you
 
01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:35.639 align:start position:0%
uh so HB
 
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
739 deals with the swept tax and the
 
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
situation of those communities that
 
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
collect more than they would be entitled
 
01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
to receive an adequacy funding the
 
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
so-called uh donor towns in the the P
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
that was used before
 
01:21:57.870 --> 01:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
2011 what the bill
 
01:22:00.669 --> 01:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
does is it
 
01:22:03.310 --> 01:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
reinstates three provisions of law that
 
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
were repealed in
 
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
2011 so as everybody I believe knows
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
01:22:13.709 --> 01:22:13.719 align:start position:0%
2011 if a community uh realized
 
01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
so-called excess swept it remitted it to
 
01:22:16.239 --> 01:22:16.910 align:start position:0%
so-called excess swept it remitted it to
the

01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
Dr and so the the principal um provision
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
here is uh three r numeral 2 and the
 
01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
language added in lines 26 to
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
29 simply states that if there is an
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
excess Statewide education property tax
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
payment due uh then it has to be uh
 
01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
remitted to the
 
01:22:43.950 --> 01:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
Dr uh again this reinstates language
 
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
that was previously in the law on page
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
two it further stipulates that any such
 
01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
funds that are remitted to the state
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
treasurer would uh be deposited in the
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and the third uh um
 
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
provision is in lines on
 
01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
page uh one lines 19 and 20 basically
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
says that figure is then netted out uh
 
01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
when determining uh the amount of the
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
education tax warrant so those are the
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
mechanics of it the purpose of the bill
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
was to put before the legislature the
 
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh streamlined surgical way of dealing
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
with the the problem and it's a problem
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
that's been discussed in the legislature
 
01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.669 align:start position:0%
that's been discussed in the legislature
uh

01:23:36.669 --> 01:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
repeatedly and of course uh we have a uh
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
we have a ruling of judge rof in the
 
01:23:46.590 --> 01:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
superior court that the U uh retention
 
01:23:49.229 --> 01:23:49.239 align:start position:0%
of excess swept is unconstitutional
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
because when it's all uh uh netted out
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
it creates uh uh inconsistent tax rates
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
across the
 
01:24:01.709 --> 01:24:01.719 align:start position:0%
state uh you could be a betting man and
 
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
and you could uh you know take bets on
 
01:24:06.669 --> 01:24:06.679 align:start position:0%
what the uh us the New Hampshire Supreme
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
Court's going to
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
do we could also wait to find out what
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
they do but I feel very confident that
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
on this particular part of Judge Rua's
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
rulings they're going to affirm and uh
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
and the legislature is going to have to
 
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
do something about it I just add you a
 
01:24:28.709 --> 01:24:28.719 align:start position:0%
little bit of my own uh perspective I
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
think that this uh this problem
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
basically is a dilemma uh it stems from
 
01:24:37.149 --> 01:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that we've chosen to provide
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
state aid uh you know under the adequacy
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
formula in part funded by the swept
 
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
which further assesses property tax and
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
when we do
 
01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
that we we're going to do either one of
 
01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
two things we're either going to allow
 
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
the towns that collect more to keep it
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
in which case I don't even understand
 
01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
you know why have a state tax on
 
01:25:04.510 --> 01:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
property that doesn't redistribute
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
anything you might as well just leave it
 
01:25:09.390 --> 01:25:09.400 align:start position:0%
to the districts and communities to have
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
a higher local Ed
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
tax but the liability is if we're going
 
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
to have a swept tax then it does have to
 
01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:17.590 align:start position:0%
to have a swept tax then it does have to
be

01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional we have other bills in
 
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
front of us that rearrange swept in a
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
variety of ways more than doubling it
 
01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
that uh uh and and there are other bills
 
01:25:30.669 --> 01:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
that also in one fashion or another uh
 
01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
address this problem so I'm not I'm not
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
a fan of swept I'm very sympathetic to
 
01:25:40.109 --> 01:25:40.119 align:start position:0%
the so-called donor uh towns uh but the
 
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
bottom line is if the swept uh tax stays
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
in law then it needs to be made
 
01:25:46.669 --> 01:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
constitutional and this is the very
 
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
least that we should do if we don't
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
address it in some other Bill thank you
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions for
 
01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:54.639 align:start position:0%
representa spillsbury
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
represent papovich and then represent
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
luno I not as much a question as much as
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
a thank you for bringing a very clean
 
01:26:04.109 --> 01:26:04.119 align:start position:0%
bill so that the committee has a
 
01:26:06.070 --> 01:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
potential tool in the toolbox if that's
 
01:26:08.910 --> 01:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
the way we need to go I appreciate it
 
01:26:11.950 --> 01:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
repr luno thank you so so thank you very
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
much and thank you very uh
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury for bringing
 
01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
this for I agree it is a very clean bill
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
and and I agree with your um with your
 
01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
statements with respect to the the um
 
01:26:27.149 --> 01:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
um how this if we're going to have a
 
01:26:29.310 --> 01:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
state property tax that it should behave
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
like a state um uh behave like a state
 
01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
tax but my question here is um is as we
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
as we go back towards um uh a a
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
situation where or condition where
 
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
excess weep is remitted so they you net
 
01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
out your cost of inadequate education
 
01:26:52.109 --> 01:26:52.119 align:start position:0%
school districts receive essentially two
 
01:26:55.629 --> 01:26:55.639 align:start position:0%
um um uh
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
I guess they receive an estimate for the
 
01:26:59.310 --> 01:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
cost of an adequate education by I think
 
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
November 15th of
 
01:27:06.189 --> 01:27:06.199 align:start position:0%
the of the PRI year prior to the the
 
01:27:07.709 --> 01:27:07.719 align:start position:0%
next school year they receive an
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
estimate of the cost of adequate
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
education and then later in the spring
 
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
that gets updated based on based on um
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
complete um admr uh information plus all
 
01:27:24.669 --> 01:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
the differentiated Aid categories uh
 
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
how does the timing of of that work with
 
01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
the with the remitting of the or with
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
the calculation of what's excess we and
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
the remitting of excess wept and if it's
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
not the same as what the actual cost of
 
01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
an adequate education was as in that you
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
know that final calculation by the
 
01:27:45.669 --> 01:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
department how would that get reconciled
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a very good question and uh
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
I know that Bruce caner is here from the
 
01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
Dr and has a pin card in I have listened
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
to him give that explanation previously
 
01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't I don't want to garble his
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
words so that would be great thank you
 
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
very much representative any further
 
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
01:28:09.790 --> 01:28:09.800 align:start position:0%

question that represent Luna just asked
 
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840 align:start position:0%

01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
um the timing uh question that just
 
01:28:49.109 --> 01:28:49.119 align:start position:0%
occurred um as written this bill if
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
signed into law would take effect July 1
 
01:28:52.750 --> 01:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:28:56.910 --> 01:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
year which means that we would be
 
01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
calculating and preparing the swept
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
warrants for use as of April 1st
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
2026 um this
 
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
fall and in order to comply with this
 
01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.430 align:start position:0%
fall and in order to comply with this
bill's

01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
bill's
 
01:29:18.189 --> 01:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
Provisions we would need to know from
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
education um their
 
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
calculation of the ad y aid for a
 
01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
um uh a district or what would be
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
effectively for that municipality so
 
01:29:37.149 --> 01:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
that our warrant would then
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
include the language which had been
 
01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
years ago on the warrants um identifying
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
the amount of the excess um swept tax
 
01:29:51.629 --> 01:29:51.639 align:start position:0%
involved in the in the total of the
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
warrant so that calculation would need
 
01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:55.400 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
done uh by the laws regulating
 
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
swept Dr has until December
 
01:30:07.709 --> 01:30:07.719 align:start position:0%
15 of 2025
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
to um have those warrants ready and and
 
01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
forwarded uh we have worked with a
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
earlier deadline under the current
 
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
law so that um
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
the swept amounts were known in advance
 
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
so that education could utilize those
 
01:30:36.109 --> 01:30:36.119 align:start position:0%
amounts in their construction of
 
01:30:36.119 --> 01:30:40.189 align:start position:0%
amounts in their construction of
adequacy

01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
um I imagine that we would have to work
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
together on the
 
01:30:51.229 --> 01:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
timing such that uh at first blush I
 
01:30:51.239 --> 01:30:52.430 align:start position:0%
timing such that uh at first blush I
would

01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
say Department of Revenue would
 
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
calculate the
 
01:31:01.109 --> 01:31:01.119 align:start position:0%
total and then once education has come
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
up with that
 
01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
estimate um we would then take that and
 
01:31:09.149 --> 01:31:09.159 align:start position:0%
use it to
 
01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:12.280 align:start position:0%
um create the warrants having
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
identified uh the excess
 
01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
amount this approach was used um so we
 
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
have a sort of a historical model on how
 
01:31:25.109 --> 01:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
to do it and and right now I think we
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
would just work with education should
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
this um bill become law to make sure
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
that the timing and the sequence of
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
events are laid out before we do
 
01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
it so Bruce uh in looking at where we
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
are in terms of trying to look at our
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
total Foundation formula here and we are
 
01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
getting some numbers right now uh from
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh doe regarding excess swep they're
 
01:31:58.030 --> 01:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
projecting for FY
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
26 of the amount of 28,6 41,00
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
257 are are those good figures we should
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
be working around right now is that are
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
we in the ball park with the the amount
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
that they're projecting for for the
 
01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:18.430 align:start position:0%
that they're projecting for for the
excess

01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
sweat those numbers must have utilized
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
the um the swept warrant
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
that are ready for um this year FY 25
 
01:32:32.189 --> 01:32:32.199 align:start position:0%
right yes
 
01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
so I have no reason to say they aren't
 
01:32:39.629 --> 01:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
um maybe education would want to weigh
 
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
in on on that okay um thank you are
 
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
questions for yes rent McGuire thank you
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for coming um the
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal note says that the cost of this
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
bill is $300,000 for your uh computer
 
01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
can you explain why there's so much cost
 
01:33:03.629 --> 01:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
here only in a very general way
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative because the rim system is
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
um not a system that the municipal
 
01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
Bureau actually utilizes because
 
01:33:16.109 --> 01:33:16.119 align:start position:0%
Municipal doesn't deal in in actual
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue so we we're not a part of it so
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
that estimate was developed by dr's
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
Administration knowing that
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
I think the rim system would have to
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
would require some alterations because a
 
01:33:32.669 --> 01:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
new Revenue stream is being proposed in
 
01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
this bill to come to Department of
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue here in conquer and that's all I
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
can really say uh we'd have to get
 
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
somebody else probably to identify why
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
the 300,000 is that
 
01:33:48.270 --> 01:33:48.280 align:start position:0%
level further question yes follow up
 
01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
thank you so um I'm following a similar
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
Bill somewhat similar Bill house bill
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
669 which we'll have a hearing at Ways
 
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
and Means tomorrow um and it does
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
something like this but in a different
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
way it simply says to all the
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities send in the check right
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
and and don't subtract uh the Grant and
 
01:34:16.669 --> 01:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
is that is that approach have less cost
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
or is it roughly the
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
same um I'm not sure I I would imagine
 
01:34:25.149 --> 01:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
that if the other bill and I think I'll
 
01:34:28.109 --> 01:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
probably see you there um that other
 
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
bill will would require the rim system
 
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
to be adjusted as well so chances are
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
rep um I see that
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
you note that excess swept is not
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
defined uh and your this is the quick
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
note and uh
 
01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
my question really is is that a problem
 
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
or not are you just noting that and you
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
say well we understand it anyway is that
 
01:35:04.629 --> 01:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
what you're
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
saying yes I mean I think the uh history
 
01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
is helping us understand what the intent
 
01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:15.629 align:start position:0%
is helping us understand what the intent
is

01:35:15.629 --> 01:35:15.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
here further
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
fellows uh thank you Mr chair um
 
01:35:27.709 --> 01:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
are you the person who told us a week or
 
01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
so ago about the when the um this swep
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
was for a short period of time was
 
01:35:38.109 --> 01:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
collected are you the person that told
 
01:35:41.470 --> 01:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
us about that the time frame yeah i'
 
01:35:43.470 --> 01:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
have to check the tape but I think so
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so do you remember what that was it
 
01:35:49.629 --> 01:35:49.639 align:start position:0%
was was it something like 200
 
01:35:52.350 --> 01:35:52.360 align:start position:0%
2003 might have been the last
 
01:35:55.870 --> 01:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
year I looked this morning to confirm my
 
01:35:57.310 --> 01:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
thoughts at
 
01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
2004 okay our records show the use of an
 
01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:04.360 align:start position:0%
excess swept 2005 I used the same
 
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
Community to test it and it's it's gone
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
from the calculations so 2004 would have
 
01:36:13.629 --> 01:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
been the last so so that that's my um
 
01:36:16.669 --> 01:36:16.679 align:start position:0%
that's what I think it is too and the a
 
01:36:18.669 --> 01:36:18.679 align:start position:0%
different figure keeps getting repeated
 
01:36:21.070 --> 01:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
for when was the last time we we
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
collected the swep and my question
 
01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
is the the Cal this might be more for
 
01:36:31.470 --> 01:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
Education than you
 
01:36:35.070 --> 01:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
but the there are changes when there are
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
changes made after changes made to the
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
adequate distribution right after well
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
after when the warrant amounts have been
 
01:36:49.149 --> 01:36:49.159 align:start position:0%
set MH and after the
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
preliminary um estimates of adequacy
 
01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
have been set
 
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking that Dr is not going to
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
have enough time to know what the the
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
excess the excess is going to change
 
01:37:10.189 --> 01:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
every time you change you take one
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
student out of the adequacy Aid
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
distribution and it CH could change what
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
the excess is depends where the you know
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
if it's in one of those towns and I
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
don't I'm wondering if you can if you
 
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
think that Dr can keep up with with
 
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
those changes to know how much needs to
 
01:37:33.310 --> 01:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
be collected and
 
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
also isn't it fairly complicated to say
 
01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that's collected
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
because that's different than the
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
warrant amount because we know that not
 
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.070 --> 01:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
taxes if I understood your question is
 
01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:54.229 align:start position:0%
taxes if I understood your question is
whether

01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
we could reissue
 
01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
changes that's
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
right I don't know the answer to
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
that so it's a question I will try and
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
to I'm sorry I'm sorry with our adequacy
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm I put too many questions
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
together there's a lot in there and when
 
01:38:27.550 --> 01:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
we unpack some of that that's collected
 
01:38:29.589 --> 01:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
what several times during it's not
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
whenever there's a change of a
 
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment in your
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
school how this thing works it's State
 
01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
Property the state so
 
01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
um towns some towns bill by anually and
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
some Bill four times a year and you're
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
not going to know what the excess is and
 
01:38:54.669 --> 01:38:54.679 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to keep changing
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
those amounts maybe and and plus not
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
everybody pays their property tax so U
 
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
representative fellas you've created
 
01:39:06.109 --> 01:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
like three-dimensional uh chess here in
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
terms of what's going on um in terms of
 
01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
changes to adequacy I have seen now this
 
01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:15.790 align:start position:0%
changes to adequacy I have seen now this
is

01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
legislative and I think it's probably in
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
the budget Bill if something changes
 
01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
then the districts have that opportunity
 
01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
to uh hold a meeting and
 
01:39:30.109 --> 01:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate or consider a change based
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
on on
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
um the legislature changing an amount in
 
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
mid sort of in
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
Midstream as for um the impacts
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
of I don't I haven't seen that in terms
 
01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
of adequacy payments being different
 
01:39:50.669 --> 01:39:50.679 align:start position:0%
based on changes in real life student
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
enrollment and so forth uh affect
 
01:40:00.109 --> 01:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
issued right well the the warrants under
 
01:40:05.709 --> 01:40:05.719 align:start position:0%
this bill would carry an amount of
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
excess if there was one identified on
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
the warrant
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
okay and that number right now to me
 
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
stands as to whether or not the warrants
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
would have to be reissued because
 
01:40:23.709 --> 01:40:23.719 align:start position:0%
somehow the excess amount has changed
 
01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:26.360 align:start position:0%
that's the question I have to find out
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
if that's um something we've ever done
 
01:40:34.189 --> 01:40:34.199 align:start position:0%
if we could do it um so that I will try
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
to get a answer back to the committee on
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
question and the collection portion I
 
01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
don't speak to in terms of well the
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
goalposts keep moving and you never can
 
01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:47.470 align:start position:0%
goalposts keep moving and you never can
get

01:40:47.470 --> 01:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:40:50.589 --> 01:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
them U I do have one question for you
 
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
when the municipalities asked to remit
 
01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
this money back to the state yes is
 
01:40:58.109 --> 01:40:58.119 align:start position:0%
there any processing fee that the
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
municipality would charge for remitting
 
01:41:03.870 --> 01:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
this calculating and and and processing
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
it back to the
 
01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
state the bill doesn't address any fee
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
and I would imagine municipalities would
 
01:41:14.669 --> 01:41:14.679 align:start position:0%
have to determine whether they have the
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
authority to charge one on a state tax
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
which I don't know the answer to I know
 
01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
there have been other bills I think last
 
01:41:26.189 --> 01:41:26.199 align:start position:0%
last year last session one that
 
01:41:28.149 --> 01:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
addressed that question but this bill
 
01:41:33.589 --> 01:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
does not so um I don't know definitively
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not there could be but this
 
01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't mention it that answers it
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
Bruce further questions from the
 
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative luno thank
 
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
you very much and and I think it's to
 
01:41:45.629 --> 01:41:45.639 align:start position:0%
the chair because I I was just sort of
 
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the at the the date that are
 
01:41:50.790 --> 01:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
contained in the in the bill and what
 
01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
you've been talking about Mr canu and
 
01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:53.790 align:start position:0%
you've been talking about Mr canu and
and

01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
and I've I've got down here sort of
 
01:41:59.709 --> 01:41:59.719 align:start position:0%
November 15th is when the Department of
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
Education prepares their preliminary
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
cost of inadequate education right so
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
that would be used in the calculation
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about 1215 which is when
 
01:42:11.550 --> 01:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
you issue the swept warrant deadline
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
deadline deadline right for swept
 
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
warrants including the calculation of
 
01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
excess swept but it would appear that
 
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
would appear to be a preliminary
 
01:42:24.189 --> 01:42:24.199 align:start position:0%
calculation at the time and then and um
 
01:42:26.430 --> 01:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
and and I know Miss Davis is here from
 
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
the Department might be able to fill in
 
01:42:31.950 --> 01:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
when the final you know firmed up cost
 
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
of inadequate education is defined
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
probably sometime between December and
 
01:42:40.589 --> 01:42:40.599 align:start position:0%
March and then you've got March 15 which
 
01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
is when the municipalities have to
 
01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
deposit um the excess to the state
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
treasury a year out again um if I might
 
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
oh oh so this isn't all in the same six
 
01:42:56.669 --> 01:42:56.679 align:start position:0%
window this is
 
01:42:59.950 --> 01:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I I'll describe first the way it
 
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
exists currently okay
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
um while the two laws would appear to to
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
um be in sort of um tension in other
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
words education needs a swept amount
 
01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
currently to help identify
 
01:43:20.830 --> 01:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid there's a
 
01:43:23.550 --> 01:43:23.560 align:start position:0%
relationship it it it was only a few
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
years ago we realized that the state law
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
swept the deadline is after the time
 
01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
when education's trying to prepare
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
something so at Dr we said well we can
 
01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
do the calculations and produce the
 
01:43:39.629 --> 01:43:39.639 align:start position:0%
swept warrants and we've aimed for the
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
last few years for toward the end of
 
01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
September we have until December 15 but
 
01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
we do them in September and distribute
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
them so that those the swept dollar
 
01:43:53.070 --> 01:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
amounts are available to education in
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
plent of time for them to work on that
 
01:43:57.910 --> 01:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
initial adequacy Aid
 
01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:59.669 align:start position:0%
initial adequacy Aid
calculation

01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
01:44:04.669 --> 01:44:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
bill it it would appear to me that we'll
 
01:44:09.589 --> 01:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
still go first at drra we're going to
 
01:44:12.390 --> 01:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
calculate the swept dollars in the same
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
methodology as we do and provide
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
education with them so they can turn
 
01:44:20.709 --> 01:44:20.719 align:start position:0%
around and do the adequacy aid
 
01:44:23.229 --> 01:44:23.239 align:start position:0%
calculations determine if there's an
 
01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
excess between what the swept amount is
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
what the adequacy initial estimate is so
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
that we then would be able to produce
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
the warrants which will now have the two
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
numbers we already know the first one
 
01:44:38.669 --> 01:44:38.679 align:start position:0%
but we can't figure out what an excess
 
01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
is education would they'd have to tell
 
01:44:42.990 --> 01:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
us so I'm thinking the timing is going
 
01:44:44.589 --> 01:44:44.599 align:start position:0%
to be very similar we're going to do it
 
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
early hand those numbers off but we're
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
not going to produce the warrants as
 
01:44:50.669 --> 01:44:50.679 align:start position:0%
early as September we're simply going to
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
do the calculations which we can do
 
01:44:55.390 --> 01:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
usually starting around June
 
01:44:59.709 --> 01:44:59.719 align:start position:0%
1st under the current Arrangement now
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
under this law let's assume for a second
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
there's no changes as representative
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
fellows was describing we go through
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
that um sequence the warrants are issued
 
01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
those warrants would be for April 1st
 
01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
2026 and would be part of the tax rate
 
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
setting in the fall of
 
01:45:22.990 --> 01:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
2026 if there's an excess to be
 
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
collected and identified in the warrant
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
it would be due in this law in by March
 
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
2027 that's in the second to last

cards on it uh obviously this is going
 
01:45:51.390 --> 01:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
to join all the other bills and we're
 
01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
going to have a wonderful discuss
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
on that uh later par
 
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
me yeah so what we're going to do is
 
01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
close this hearing see I don't have any
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
further pin cards on
 
01:46:08.189 --> 01:46:08.199 align:start position:0%
739 and we're going to move into the
 
01:46:08.199 --> 01:46:09.229 align:start position:0%
739 and we're going to move into the
last

01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
one for the day which is
 
01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
729 making appropriation to the
 
01:46:16.709 --> 01:46:16.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Education for an attorney
 
01:46:19.589 --> 01:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
to rec codify the education
 
01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
laws thank you very much and we have two
 
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
cards here
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
here all righty so representative Hill
 
01:46:29.870 --> 01:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
you're up
 
01:46:33.790 --> 01:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
and Caitlyn Davis on you're on Deck
 
01:46:35.470 --> 01:46:35.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record I
 
01:46:38.910 --> 01:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
am representative Greg Hill Uh current
 
01:46:40.990 --> 01:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
chairman of legislative Administration I
 
01:46:43.149 --> 01:46:43.159 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Northfield uh
 
01:46:46.669 --> 01:46:46.679 align:start position:0%
maram 2 um
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
real simple Bill I'm hoping
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
um we've had this bill in the pass uh it
 
01:46:57.550 --> 01:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
has been passed through the house
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
and then was referred to the uh to
 
01:47:04.990 --> 01:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
division two of Finance um they retained
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
it uh I'm not sure really how far they
 
01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
they went in that process um perhaps
 
01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
Miss Davis from doe can fill you in on
 
01:47:20.589 --> 01:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
that part of the process um that bill I
 
01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
think requested 80,000 I think think uh
 
01:47:26.030 --> 01:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
at some point it's been bumped up now to
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
100,000 to rectify or begin the process
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
of recodification of our education
 
01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
statutes um no one Beyond uh chairman
 
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
lad can tell us uh how just just how big
 
01:47:46.189 --> 01:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
a problem this is um we've all
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
experienced uh those of us that have
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
been here for any length of time have
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
experienced the problems within the
 
01:47:55.589 --> 01:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
education statutes and duplication and
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh contradiction in some cases um it's
 
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
certainly something we need to do and
 
01:48:02.430 --> 01:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
we've been kicking this can down the
 
01:48:06.589 --> 01:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
road for quite some time so um with that
 
01:48:09.189 --> 01:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
I will uh end my testimony I'm not sure
 
01:48:12.109 --> 01:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
if there's any real need for questions
 
01:48:14.109 --> 01:48:14.119 align:start position:0%
um I think those would be best handled
 
01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
by uh by uh Miss Davis of the of
 
01:48:24.270 --> 01:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
doe but I will attempt or or deflect I
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
know you're very good at answer asking
 
01:48:27.950 --> 01:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
questions on this committee I don't see
 
01:48:30.189 --> 01:48:30.199 align:start position:0%
any hands thank you so thank you very
 
01:48:42.430 --> 01:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
doe good morning Kaitlyn Davis from the
 
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um so this bill
 
01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
um really started when representative
 
01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
Hill was at the Department of Education
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
for a public school infrastructure
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
meeting of all things and we were trying
 
01:48:57.070 --> 01:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
to look up several things and finding
 
01:48:58.350 --> 01:48:58.360 align:start position:0%
trying to I think we were trying to
 
01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
determine certain definitions of who
 
01:49:02.030 --> 01:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
might be eligible for public school
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure funds and you're trying
 
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
to use various definitions and saying
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
well this conflicts with this conflicts
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
um and so we were saying it would be
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
really helpful if we could have a
 
01:49:15.629 --> 01:49:15.639 align:start position:0%
recodification of education laws um the
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
laws in this book some of them have been
 
01:49:20.589 --> 01:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
on record for over a hundred years and
 
01:49:23.229 --> 01:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
that means many of them are outdated um
 
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
or don't necessarily make sense or when
 
01:49:26.669 --> 01:49:26.679 align:start position:0%
they were written obviously the
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
processes that we have in place now
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
could have never even been conceived in
 
01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
people's minds you know especially with
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
technology that we have um and so we
 
01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
really Envision um a recodification of
 
01:49:40.149 --> 01:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
the law to really just go through and
 
01:49:42.629 --> 01:49:42.639 align:start position:0%
find different areas that need to be
 
01:49:45.149 --> 01:49:45.159 align:start position:0%
clarified different areas that conflict
 
01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
different areas that need to potentially
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
be updated there are um areas of law
 
01:49:51.870 --> 01:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
that still require say a paper report to
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
be submitted to the Department of
 
01:49:54.990 --> 01:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
Education which doesn't necessarily make
 
01:49:56.510 --> 01:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
any sense for why we're having people
 
01:50:00.109 --> 01:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
use paper now um there are other areas
 
01:50:01.790 --> 01:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
where it's easy for the Department of
 
01:50:03.229 --> 01:50:03.239 align:start position:0%
Education and the department of revenue
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
for example to share data and
 
01:50:08.510 --> 01:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
information now but it requires a school
 
01:50:09.790 --> 01:50:09.800 align:start position:0%
district to submit something both to the
 
01:50:11.229 --> 01:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and Department
 
01:50:12.910 --> 01:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
of Revenue and we want to make sure that
 
01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
we're using best um the best systems in
 
01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
place and you know best use of people's
 
01:50:19.950 --> 01:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
times there's actually one um that uh
 
01:50:22.189 --> 01:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
Bruce and I were talking to this morning
 
01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
about an email we found an area where uh
 
01:50:26.030 --> 01:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
something has to be submitted to both
 
01:50:28.510 --> 01:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
the doe and the Department of Revenue um
 
01:50:29.950 --> 01:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
and we said well do they submit to you
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
separately and we were trying to figure
 
01:50:34.830 --> 01:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
out why why is this need to be done um
 
01:50:37.390 --> 01:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of places in law
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately conflict um or maybe
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
terms have ch changed over the years and
 
01:50:44.669 --> 01:50:44.679 align:start position:0%
so we're using older terminology that
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily tie to the practices
 
01:50:49.470 --> 01:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
that we have today um you know a simple
 
01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
one that I can think of is you know if I
 
01:50:54.069 --> 01:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
say the the word public or sorry if I
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
say the word private school most of you
 
01:50:58.390 --> 01:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
know what I'm talking about and the word
 
01:51:00.189 --> 01:51:00.199 align:start position:0%
private school does appear in law I
 
01:51:01.709 --> 01:51:01.719 align:start position:0%
actually think it's on a in a bill
 
01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
that's on the docket this week for I
 
01:51:04.350 --> 01:51:04.360 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's the policy committee
 
01:51:07.310 --> 01:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
or this committee but it talks about um
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
something that private schools have to
 
01:51:10.109 --> 01:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
do well we actually don't technically
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
have private schools in the state of New
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have non-public schools
 
01:51:15.629 --> 01:51:15.639 align:start position:0%
that's the terminology that we use um
 
01:51:17.709 --> 01:51:17.719 align:start position:0%
and so clarifying that would be very
 
01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
helpful um another really good example
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
um if you remember a couple weeks ago
 
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
when attorney Fenton did well she did
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
that I guess she did her presentation
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
for the policy committee but one of the
 
01:51:30.669 --> 01:51:30.679 align:start position:0%
things that she mentioned is Charter
 
01:51:32.350 --> 01:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
Schools when you're writing a law you
 
01:51:34.350 --> 01:51:34.360 align:start position:0%
have to write into the law that you want
 
01:51:35.790 --> 01:51:35.800 align:start position:0%
a charter school to do something
 
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise they're exempt relative to a
 
01:51:39.069 --> 01:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
law in RSA
 
01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
194b that's a great example because
 
01:51:44.189 --> 01:51:44.199 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of laws on the books that
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
have been on the books historically that
 
01:51:48.350 --> 01:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
say all schools have to do this but then
 
01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
with that reading that with the other
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
law that says charter schools are exempt
 
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
unless it specifically says Charter
 
01:51:55.470 --> 01:51:55.480 align:start position:0%
Schools people think that charter
 
01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
schools are doing whatever that
 
01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
requirement is but it's not because that
 
01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
all schools was on the books since like
 
01:52:04.109 --> 01:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
1970s Charter Schools were the
 
01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
legislation enabling them was written in
 
01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:06.950 align:start position:0%
legislation enabling them was written in
the

01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
1990s um so there's a lot of examples
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
like that I mean another example I just
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
looked up real quick RSA 193 says the
 
01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Education May collect
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
student addresses for the purpos of
 
01:52:20.189 --> 01:52:20.199 align:start position:0%
assessment reasons and then RSA 18968
 
01:52:21.550 --> 01:52:21.560 align:start position:0%
says the Department of Education shall
 
01:52:23.310 --> 01:52:23.320 align:start position:0%
not collect addresses
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
um and so really you know this is a
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
collection of laws that has been written
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
by a large uh number of individuals
 
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
through a long period of time that
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
really needs to be gone through in a
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
thoughtful manner um Rewritten
 
01:52:41.109 --> 01:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
recodified um not even to we're not
 
01:52:42.430 --> 01:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
talking about changing the laws we're
 
01:52:44.430 --> 01:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
not talking about saying you know really
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
making political decisions we're really
 
01:52:47.709 --> 01:52:47.719 align:start position:0%
just saying these are technical
 
01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
Corrections Alone um and the department
 
01:52:54.069 --> 01:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
has you know started process piece by
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
piece we are working on right one right
 
01:52:58.510 --> 01:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
now a proposal around the charter school
 
01:53:00.629 --> 01:53:00.639 align:start position:0%
laws to try to update those I know
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative fellows has sponsored
 
01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
bills over the last couple years for the
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
Department just to change different
 
01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements and whatnot so
 
01:53:09.229 --> 01:53:09.239 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to do it piece by
 
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
piece but it makes sense to have a
 
01:53:13.390 --> 01:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
larger whole whole project done to do
 
01:53:16.229 --> 01:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
this um relative to uh what
 
01:53:18.430 --> 01:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
representative um Hill talked about as
 
01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
far as the process so this bill was
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
passed out of Ed fi uh regular education
 
01:53:28.069 --> 01:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
um about three years ago it was included
 
01:53:31.709 --> 01:53:31.719 align:start position:0%
it went over to finance um Finance had
 
01:53:33.390 --> 01:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
come up with a proposal which we felt
 
01:53:35.109 --> 01:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
was a really good proposal division too
 
01:53:37.390 --> 01:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
as part of the budget process um which
 
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
was because this concern with the
 
01:53:42.109 --> 01:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
funding if that's enough which was have
 
01:53:45.149 --> 01:53:45.159 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education uh do an RFP
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
to have this work done and then come to
 
01:53:49.470 --> 01:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee with that proposal and
 
01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal could have the authority to fund
 
01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
it or not to fund it um in our
 
01:53:56.069 --> 01:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
recollection of finance and
 
01:53:58.669 --> 01:53:58.679 align:start position:0%
representative Murray um just said she
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
just said to me didn't we pass this out
 
01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
of Finance everybody remembers it being
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
passed out of Finance but it didn't end
 
01:54:05.109 --> 01:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
up in the hb2 proposal that left the
 
01:54:07.709 --> 01:54:07.719 align:start position:0%
house over to the Senate um so we don't
 
01:54:09.069 --> 01:54:09.079 align:start position:0%
we don't really know what happened to
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
that proposal um then last year outside
 
01:54:14.830 --> 01:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
of the budget uh cycle the Senate did
 
01:54:17.550 --> 01:54:17.560 align:start position:0%
take this up um a bill at his own
 
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
because it had been retained by um
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
education initially and um the Senate
 
01:54:25.149 --> 01:54:25.159 align:start position:0%
proposal that they put together was a
 
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
little complex and the house did not end
 
01:54:30.390 --> 01:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
up concurring with the Senate's proposal
 
01:54:32.189 --> 01:54:32.199 align:start position:0%
which included a fair number of
 
01:54:35.189 --> 01:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
committees and whatnot which I don't
 
01:54:36.990 --> 01:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
believe really needed to be done in the
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
preliminary work now maybe at the end
 
01:54:40.229 --> 01:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
result of the work and you know what
 
01:54:41.950 --> 01:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
ends up in the law a committee could be
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
helpful but not in the initial phase um
 
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
I think the only other thing that um you
 
01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
know just so I don't upset our my
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
counterparts and state employees ol has
 
01:54:54.669 --> 01:54:54.679 align:start position:0%
a heavy hand in this um and wants to be
 
01:54:56.830 --> 01:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
included in this process so I do think
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
that we could um we could suggest that
 
01:55:00.750 --> 01:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
the department of education does an RFP
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
in collaboration with OS um to ensure
 
01:55:06.629 --> 01:55:06.639 align:start position:0%
that they think um the right resources
 
01:55:09.229 --> 01:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
um are assigned to doing the initial
 
01:55:13.149 --> 01:55:13.159 align:start position:0%
work um and I know OSS obviously um
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
wants to be very involved in what the
 
01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
end product is and and they said you
 
01:55:18.629 --> 01:55:18.639 align:start position:0%
know it's going to take quite a bit of
 
01:55:20.430 --> 01:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
Staff time to actually write it and
 
01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
reformat it and do all of that work once
 
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
we have the product and they wanted to
 
01:55:26.830 --> 01:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that you know that was part of
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
the conversation but I think that's
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
really phase two phase one is just
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
really getting the RFP in the initial
 
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
proposal and all of the areas identified
 
01:55:38.350 --> 01:55:38.360 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed
 
01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much um it's a real
 
01:55:45.950 --> 01:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
needed Bill let me tell you in between
 
01:55:48.430 --> 01:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
calling a curricular co-curricular
 
01:55:50.910 --> 01:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
extracurricular exactly pupil vers
 
01:55:53.950 --> 01:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
student uh there's so much confusion in
 
01:55:56.589 --> 01:55:56.599 align:start position:0%
these statutes they need to be cleaned
 
01:56:00.430 --> 01:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
up um hopefully we can get that going
 
01:56:03.149 --> 01:56:03.159 align:start position:0%
questions represent luno then represent
 
01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you very much Mr chair
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Miss Davis for
 
01:56:09.189 --> 01:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
bringing um for for being here and
 
01:56:12.430 --> 01:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
talking about this um a lot of the
 
01:56:14.750 --> 01:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
things you talked about seem to suggest
 
01:56:16.709 --> 01:56:16.719 align:start position:0%
that maybe different language might be
 
01:56:18.910 --> 01:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
necessary like if we want to do an RFP
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
to uh have um have joint fiscal
 
01:56:24.270 --> 01:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
essentially be the appropriating body
 
01:56:27.589 --> 01:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
yes um for this I also wanted to to
 
01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
maybe poke on line 14 of the bill which
 
01:56:32.069 --> 01:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
talks about the work should be completed
 
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
by September 30th 2025 that's right
 
01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
around the corner I think that's the
 
01:56:37.470 --> 01:56:37.480 align:start position:0%
original bill from two years ago when
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative Hill wrote it the first
 
01:56:40.589 --> 01:56:40.599 align:start position:0%
time and I think they just carry forward
 
01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
that date but so maybe that's a 2027
 
01:56:45.550 --> 01:56:45.560 align:start position:0%
type of I think so so representative
 
01:56:46.750 --> 01:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
Hill reached out to me over the summer
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
he said I was thinking about putting
 
01:56:49.790 --> 01:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
this bill back in are you supportive I
 
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
said absolutely um but I did say you
 
01:56:54.030 --> 01:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
know I think we'll probably talk about
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
the process and how it and he said yeah
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's perfectly fine so okay great
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
thank you this is another note this has
 
01:57:04.750 --> 01:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
been proposed by Attorneys at OSS for
 
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
years and we have several recently
 
01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
retired attorneys over by the name of
 
01:57:11.669 --> 01:57:11.679 align:start position:0%
Anthony and Jeff I won't give their last
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
names which have really wanted to see
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
something happen here because every one
 
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
of us comes in there with these ideas
 
01:57:20.830 --> 01:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
and we try to throw them in a law not
 
01:57:22.189 --> 01:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
recognizing there's something that
 
01:57:26.750 --> 01:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
counters it over here and we have a very
 
01:57:31.149 --> 01:57:31.159 align:start position:0%
a huge book that's now full of conflicts
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
I usually start this testimony by
 
01:57:33.950 --> 01:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
dropping the book on the table it makes
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
a really good prop for this but wasn't
 
01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't into that today but so
 
01:57:40.629 --> 01:57:40.639 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire then represent
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
Pap or papet or spelsbury one of the
 
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
other do you have do you have an sorry
 
01:57:50.709 --> 01:57:50.719 align:start position:0%
do you have an estimate for how much
 
01:57:54.629 --> 01:57:54.639 align:start position:0%
thinner that book will be after this I'm
 
01:57:56.030 --> 01:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
sure you would go ahead and make it
 
01:57:59.629 --> 01:57:59.639 align:start position:0%
pretty thick white right again so but
 
01:57:59.639 --> 01:58:00.430 align:start position:0%
pretty thick white right again so but
follow

01:58:00.430 --> 01:58:00.440 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:58:04.629 --> 01:58:04.639 align:start position:0%
up yeah how much attorney time does
 
01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 buy it doesn't seem like enough
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
that's exactly the conversation that was
 
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:11.320 align:start position:0%
had last time and so um when
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
representative Hill initially proposed
 
01:58:15.149 --> 01:58:15.159 align:start position:0%
the bill we he literally just spit ball
 
01:58:17.189 --> 01:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
and number $100,000 round number and
 
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's why we said it's probably not
 
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
enough appropriation that's why and
 
01:58:23.069 --> 01:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
that's with the conversation we had with
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
the division too was how about the
 
01:58:27.069 --> 01:58:27.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Education put out an RFP
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
for this because there's companies that
 
01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
are out there that do this work um and
 
01:58:34.669 --> 01:58:34.679 align:start position:0%
but who knows you know a proposal this
 
01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
large um and that's why they wanted us
 
01:58:39.669 --> 01:58:39.679 align:start position:0%
to come to fiscal with the RFP to
 
01:58:42.589 --> 01:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
request the so basically if we modified
 
01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
the bill or amend the bill to allow the
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to or require
 
01:58:47.310 --> 01:58:47.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education to develop
 
01:58:51.069 --> 01:58:51.079 align:start position:0%
the RFP in consultation with OS and then
 
01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:53.159 align:start position:0%
gave the fiscal the authority to
 
01:58:55.950 --> 01:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate funds to an RFP that you
 
01:58:57.470 --> 01:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
know obviously would be a decision a
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal but we would come to with a
 
01:59:00.669 --> 01:59:00.679 align:start position:0%
request and he would appropriate the
 
01:59:02.830 --> 01:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
funds for that work we would if you then
 
01:59:05.390 --> 01:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
chose to appropriate the funds we would
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
then um go to governor and Council to
 
01:59:10.669 --> 01:59:10.679 align:start position:0%
finalize the contract just one more
 
01:59:13.950 --> 01:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
please thank you is there a
 
01:59:18.069 --> 01:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
self-contained section that we could say
 
01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
get Rewritten and then have experience
 
01:59:27.149 --> 01:59:27.159 align:start position:0%
in re redrafting that section and then
 
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
could estimate the rest of the job so I
 
01:59:31.950 --> 01:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
think the challenge with that is is that
 
01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
the sections all bleed into each other
 
01:59:36.350 --> 01:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
so much it's really challenging um I
 
01:59:38.430 --> 01:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
mean the charter schools is a great
 
01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
example so the charter school law really
 
01:59:42.910 --> 01:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
really needs to be re Rewritten um
 
01:59:44.830 --> 01:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
because what There Was You Know local
 
01:59:46.589 --> 01:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
charter schools and rather than you know
 
01:59:48.350 --> 01:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
writing a separate section of local and
 
01:59:49.990 --> 01:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
state it was all kind of written on top
 
01:59:51.390 --> 01:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
of each other which was written on open
 
01:59:52.589 --> 01:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
enrollment School schools which is a
 
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
conversation you all have been had
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
having as well um and so we've been
 
02:00:00.109 --> 02:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
doing that um kind of when we have time
 
02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
in the officing like oh here's this
 
02:00:03.149 --> 02:00:03.159 align:start position:0%
here's this but then oh well there's
 
02:00:05.069 --> 02:00:05.079 align:start position:0%
also charter school requirement in
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
building Aid there's also a charter
 
02:00:09.069 --> 02:00:09.079 align:start position:0%
school requirement over here and and so
 
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's challenging I mean you're
 
02:00:13.350 --> 02:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
going to see pece by peace mail
 
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
proposals from the Department over the
 
02:00:15.550 --> 02:00:15.560 align:start position:0%
year because it's something that we are
 
02:00:18.189 --> 02:00:18.199 align:start position:0%
trying to do as we can get to them but
 
02:00:20.669 --> 02:00:20.679 align:start position:0%
not not
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
really um represent no okay representa
 
02:00:27.390 --> 02:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
spilsbury in first he he just waved off
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
no no I'll go next par me I'll go next
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
no okay and then represent fellows thank
 
02:00:37.709 --> 02:00:37.719 align:start position:0%
you who I thought he was waving off yes
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
my question was basically Mr M okay then
 
02:00:43.069 --> 02:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
I would like go
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
ahead um
 
02:00:49.470 --> 02:00:49.480 align:start position:0%
so when laws are enacted and there's an
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment process and then ultimately
 
02:00:54.510 --> 02:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
there's codification which rearranges
 
02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
them but where we're trying to rec
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
codify an entire volume of laws there
 
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
there will be undoubtedly many many
 
02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
changes to the statutory language that
 
02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
would be required so ultimately this has
 
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
to come back to the leg in yeah yeah no
 
02:01:11.069 --> 02:01:11.079 align:start position:0%
the department can't make laws as much
 
02:01:13.229 --> 02:01:13.239 align:start position:0%
as we like
 
02:01:16.709 --> 02:01:16.719 align:start position:0%
to okay so so the the concept of course
 
02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
is not to change the thrust or intent of
 
02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
any of the laws but to Simply
 
02:01:22.310 --> 02:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
reconstruct them so so that they're
 
02:01:24.750 --> 02:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
clearing and consistent absolutely and
 
02:01:26.270 --> 02:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
so the end result of that would
 
02:01:28.350 --> 02:01:28.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately be and this would be you know
 
02:01:29.629 --> 02:01:29.639 align:start position:0%
so the department would do its work we
 
02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
would have a proposal we would work with
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
the OS to you know that's why they said
 
02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
they might need additional resources to
 
02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
completely Rec codify it in their style
 
02:01:38.589 --> 02:01:38.599 align:start position:0%
and then we would come back probably to
 
02:01:41.069 --> 02:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
the chair of House Education um to say
 
02:01:43.149 --> 02:01:43.159 align:start position:0%
will you sponsor this bill and we
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely anticipate probably a
 
02:01:47.589 --> 02:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
thousand page Bill to rectify the entire
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
thing it's it will be it will be giant
 
02:01:52.510 --> 02:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
but it and it probably to my knowledge
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
as the first of this kind at the
 
02:01:55.830 --> 02:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
department of or the state of New
 
02:01:58.030 --> 02:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire other agencies have certainly
 
02:02:00.990 --> 02:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
talked about needing to have similar um
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
have similar processes done so we could
 
02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
maybe the state could cut its teeth with
 
02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
the Department's proposal but we'll find
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
out thank you you've confirmed what I
 
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
imagined represent fellows thank you um
 
02:02:14.709 --> 02:02:14.719 align:start position:0%
I I know this has been an issue and a
 
02:02:16.990 --> 02:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
you know something people have wanted
 
02:02:21.149 --> 02:02:21.159 align:start position:0%
for more than a decade so I'm I'm just
 
02:02:24.390 --> 02:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
concerned that um $100,000 doesn't get
 
02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
you very far and I'm wondering if you
 
02:02:30.990 --> 02:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
have an idea about what could
 
02:02:36.109 --> 02:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
be the first step or one part that we
 
02:02:39.629 --> 02:02:39.639 align:start position:0%
could actually see results from so that
 
02:02:42.430 --> 02:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
we don't just get an RFP that just
 
02:02:45.870 --> 02:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
writes the next RFP for what needs to be
 
02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
done so I mean I I think ultimately we I
 
02:02:53.910 --> 02:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
think we just do an RFP for the full
 
02:02:55.350 --> 02:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
amount and we really see what those
 
02:02:57.709 --> 02:02:57.719 align:start position:0%
proposals look like until we have an r
 
02:03:00.270 --> 02:03:00.280 align:start position:0%
and and you know the end results might
 
02:03:02.790 --> 02:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
be that of an RFP that nobody thinks
 
02:03:04.350 --> 02:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
it's a proposal worth going forward but
 
02:03:05.709 --> 02:03:05.719 align:start position:0%
I think we need to do that we need to
 
02:03:07.229 --> 02:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
get that information out there and see
 
02:03:09.069 --> 02:03:09.079 align:start position:0%
what that's going to look like um and
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
then have the department work with the
 
02:03:11.870 --> 02:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
legislature to see if that's the steps
 
02:03:14.189 --> 02:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
you want to follow um if not then we
 
02:03:16.669 --> 02:03:16.679 align:start position:0%
need to have a public a conversation of
 
02:03:18.430 --> 02:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
is there an additional staff attorney a
 
02:03:20.830 --> 02:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
temporary full-time position at OS that
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
could potentially be doing this work or
 
02:03:24.270 --> 02:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
what does this actually look like but I
 
02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
concur with you that $100,000 is not
 
02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
very much and we would not get very much
 
02:03:31.229 --> 02:03:31.239 align:start position:0%
probably for $100,000 proposal but we
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
have to start somewhere and that's why
 
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
we really suggested that let's do an RFP
 
02:03:37.870 --> 02:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
see what the total dollar amount is we
 
02:03:39.709 --> 02:03:39.719 align:start position:0%
won't put a $100,000 price limit on the
 
02:03:42.270 --> 02:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
RFP we will come to fiscal and say you
 
02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
know please appropriate additional money
 
02:03:45.549 --> 02:03:45.559 align:start position:0%
so you could take out the appropriation
 
02:03:47.149 --> 02:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
entirely in an amendment of this bill
 
02:03:49.390 --> 02:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
and just say do an RF Department do an
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
RFP bring that RFP to fiscal and let's
 
02:03:53.589 --> 02:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
what that looks like and we could you
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
know you could if you want to um in
 
02:03:58.990 --> 02:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment suggests the department um
 
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
have the RFP use some sort of phased
 
02:04:03.549 --> 02:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
approach we could certainly do that my
 
02:04:05.310 --> 02:04:05.320 align:start position:0%
concern with a phased approach though is
 
02:04:06.669 --> 02:04:06.679 align:start position:0%
you know what I said to representative
 
02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
McGuire is that because it's so
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
intertwined if you said just look at
 
02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
another you know another great example
 
02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
are the invent the data system
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
inventories I can tell you at least four
 
02:04:18.510 --> 02:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
sections in law every time somebody says
 
02:04:20.430 --> 02:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
oh can you do this with data I have to
 
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
look here here here and here and that's
 
02:04:24.629 --> 02:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
not even all of the places where it says
 
02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%
that so I would be really concerned with
 
02:04:28.149 --> 02:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
if you just did you know a small section
 
02:04:30.390 --> 02:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
of law that you'd be missing some pretty
 
02:04:32.109 --> 02:04:32.119 align:start position:0%
critical P pieces that are spread in
 
02:04:33.589 --> 02:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
another section of
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
law yep so what I'm thinking is that
 
02:04:39.470 --> 02:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
that could be an example of how you
 
02:04:43.229 --> 02:04:43.239 align:start position:0%
start with you know just like a smaller
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
project which even that might you know
 
02:04:48.229 --> 02:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
the example to like look at the charter
 
02:04:51.149 --> 02:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
schools and and propose something for
 
02:04:52.990 --> 02:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
what to do with those in the data
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
collection or you know just like two
 
02:04:56.830 --> 02:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
pieces and that you might be able to
 
02:04:58.950 --> 02:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
straighten out that part of it because
 
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
to do the whole thing is going to take
 
02:05:04.750 --> 02:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
multiple people multiple years
 
02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
so but we got to understand that they're
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
all linked I can look at the military
 
02:05:12.270 --> 02:05:12.280 align:start position:0%
compacts which we have and I and talking
 
02:05:14.709 --> 02:05:14.719 align:start position:0%
about special education and they're all
 
02:05:17.229 --> 02:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
cross interl and if this we're going to
 
02:05:20.510 --> 02:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
do it it's got to be done we can't do
 
02:05:22.669 --> 02:05:22.679 align:start position:0%
this peace meal so it's going to cost
 
02:05:22.679 --> 02:05:23.709 align:start position:0%
this peace meal so it's going to cost
some

02:05:23.709 --> 02:05:23.719 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
bucks uh represent Dame and then
 
02:05:29.470 --> 02:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
representative uh Burton thank you Mr
 
02:05:31.629 --> 02:05:31.639 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for helping us with
 
02:05:31.639 --> 02:05:33.470 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for helping us with
this

02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:05:37.149 --> 02:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
um so two things you gave some very
 
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
helpful examples of why we would need to
 
02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
do this and spoke about technical
 
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
corrections but also about the potential
 
02:05:46.510 --> 02:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
for a thousand-page bill of statutory
 
02:05:48.750 --> 02:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
changes and it seems to me from some of
 
02:05:53.310 --> 02:05:53.320 align:start position:0%
the examples are cited and just logic
 
02:05:55.310 --> 02:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
that given that there's contradiction in
 
02:05:59.350 --> 02:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
the statutes like your example of um
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
addresses student addresses being
 
02:06:04.270 --> 02:06:04.280 align:start position:0%
collected or not that it's definitely
 
02:06:06.189 --> 02:06:06.199 align:start position:0%
not just working towards technical
 
02:06:09.149 --> 02:06:09.159 align:start position:0%
changes there must be many that would it
 
02:06:10.990 --> 02:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
be correct that there are many changes
 
02:06:13.589 --> 02:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
not just technical so we probably we
 
02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
need somebody to come up with a proposal
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
to identify conflicts that might
 
02:06:19.470 --> 02:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
actually and you're right that is that's
 
02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
a political change like do you want the
 
02:06:22.910 --> 02:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
department to have addresses or not well
 
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know if I just look at the
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
assessment law and I don't look full
 
02:06:27.390 --> 02:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
picture I can go ahead and go collect
 
02:06:28.549 --> 02:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
them because I would say I'm following
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
the law and my assessment team who
 
02:06:32.109 --> 02:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
really just consecrates on the special
 
02:06:33.709 --> 02:06:33.719 align:start position:0%
the assessment law might think that they
 
02:06:37.229 --> 02:06:37.239 align:start position:0%
have the authority to to do addresses um
 
02:06:40.750 --> 02:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
so um but you are right that there are
 
02:06:43.229 --> 02:06:43.239 align:start position:0%
going to be decisions that need to be
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
made as part of the ultimate um Bill be
 
02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
because of the areas that conflict yes
 
02:06:54.430 --> 02:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
yes well yes thank
 
02:06:57.069 --> 02:06:57.079 align:start position:0%
you are there other states that have
 
02:06:59.629 --> 02:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
taken on such a substantial
 
02:07:02.910 --> 02:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
recodification and if so can we learn
 
02:07:05.629 --> 02:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
from their experience so I'm not aware
 
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
of that but I haven't done any Research
 
02:07:10.750 --> 02:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
into that as well um I do think that OS
 
02:07:14.069 --> 02:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
um had some information OS I was
 
02:07:16.669 --> 02:07:16.679 align:start position:0%
actually expecting them to be here today
 
02:07:18.149 --> 02:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
um because they have a lot of thoughts
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
and opinions on this as well um but um I
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
think ol has talked about other states
 
02:07:25.990 --> 02:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
doing it or maybe knowing people that
 
02:07:28.030 --> 02:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
have done it there's definitely
 
02:07:29.669 --> 02:07:29.679 align:start position:0%
companies out there that do it if you
 
02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
Google it real quick you can find
 
02:07:32.950 --> 02:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
companies so it's clearly a service
 
02:07:35.589 --> 02:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
that's needed and I'm guessing um you
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
know they could tell you what states
 
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
they've worked with I don't know if it's
 
02:07:40.990 --> 02:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
education specific um you know the
 
02:07:42.830 --> 02:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
federal government does it fairly frequ
 
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
not frequently but for example you know
 
02:07:46.990 --> 02:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
they rewrote No Child Left Behind into
 
02:07:49.069 --> 02:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
the every student succeeds act um and
 
02:07:49.950 --> 02:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
that was essentially just a
 
02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:51.589 align:start position:0%
that was essentially just a
recodification

02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
recodification
 
02:07:53.069 --> 02:07:53.079 align:start position:0%
um there were obviously many changes
 
02:07:54.990 --> 02:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
that were made too but that was a base
 
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
law that is was kind of started and and
 
02:08:00.549 --> 02:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
worked on so it's definitely something
 
02:08:02.589 --> 02:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
that you know in our you know our
 
02:08:04.030 --> 02:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
Attorneys at the Department of Education
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
if we had more of them they could
 
02:08:07.549 --> 02:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
probably do that too if you know Liz
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
Brown and Diane Fenton both work on
 
02:08:11.709 --> 02:08:11.719 align:start position:0%
these all of the time that they do not
 
02:08:14.350 --> 02:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
have the capacity to do that so um if we
 
02:08:15.390 --> 02:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
had a full-time attorney at the
 
02:08:16.950 --> 02:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
department that focus on that I mean
 
02:08:19.069 --> 02:08:19.079 align:start position:0%
there's there's a a variety of different
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
ways of getting this done um but really
 
02:08:24.149 --> 02:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
I think we need to do is all accept that
 
02:08:25.950 --> 02:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
this is not great the way it is right
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
now and we cannot continue to move
 
02:08:30.109 --> 02:08:30.119 align:start position:0%
forward because we're just continuing to
 
02:08:32.350 --> 02:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
build on a foundation that is really
 
02:08:34.669 --> 02:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
weak um and we got to draw a line in the
 
02:08:36.189 --> 02:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
sand and say we're going to make these
 
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
improvements going
 
02:08:40.990 --> 02:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:43.189 --> 02:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
Burton thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um having been
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
out of the legislature for six years I
 
02:08:52.149 --> 02:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
was really impressed when an AI reviewed
 
02:08:55.830 --> 02:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
thousands of pages of testimony and came
 
02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
up with a simplified
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
model instead of making Robo calls to
 
02:09:03.069 --> 02:09:03.079 align:start position:0%
everybody is it possible that an AI
 
02:09:06.109 --> 02:09:06.119 align:start position:0%
could take this on objectively go
 
02:09:08.109 --> 02:09:08.119 align:start position:0%
through the thing and then spit out
 
02:09:11.149 --> 02:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
where the yeah I mean I think that um AI
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
is definitely a tool that could be used
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
here um but it it needs to be guided by
 
02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
somebody and the department does still
 
02:09:19.870 --> 02:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the staff and capacity to
 
02:09:23.310 --> 02:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
guide that so A proposal from a um a
 
02:09:26.830 --> 02:09:26.840 align:start position:0%
vendor certainly could um start off with
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
using AI to do a lot of this work and
 
02:09:30.069 --> 02:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
that's a great tool that's been
 
02:09:32.350 --> 02:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
developed even in the 3 to four years
 
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
that I've been after this that wasn't
 
02:09:37.390 --> 02:09:37.400 align:start position:0%
available four years ago
 
02:09:39.950 --> 02:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
but representative cocom and then
 
02:09:41.229 --> 02:09:41.239 align:start position:0%
representative Ames did you have your
 
02:09:43.950 --> 02:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
hand up yes thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:09:46.229 --> 02:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you mentioned
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
before and this has been something I've
 
02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:50.559 align:start position:0%
been a little bit curious about um you
 
02:09:52.750 --> 02:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
brought up we no longer use private
 
02:09:56.430 --> 02:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
schools we use non-public schools and I
 
02:09:58.669 --> 02:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
I've noticed a recent we Chang
 
02:10:01.950 --> 02:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
superintendent to be senior education
 
02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
official so I'm curious are we changing
 
02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
those through the law is that's what's
 
02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
happening to the these changes did we
 
02:10:11.310 --> 02:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
change um the superintendent title to be
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
senior ex um education official through
 
02:10:15.709 --> 02:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
law and that's what's creating the
 
02:10:18.109 --> 02:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
conflict that you're finding here so the
 
02:10:20.669 --> 02:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
non-public schools are absolutely that's
 
02:10:22.229 --> 02:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
in law that we use the term non-public
 
02:10:24.589 --> 02:10:24.599 align:start position:0%
schools in law um relationship to the
 
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent um title I and the senior
 
02:10:31.229 --> 02:10:31.239 align:start position:0%
education official I believe that's in
 
02:10:34.069 --> 02:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
rule but I mean rule is also a type of
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
law that's passed through Del car um but
 
02:10:40.350 --> 02:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
a state board of education role oh yes
 
02:10:42.510 --> 02:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
so with that example is that creating a
 
02:10:43.750 --> 02:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
conflict because I think we can have
 
02:10:44.830 --> 02:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
some school districts with a
 
02:10:47.189 --> 02:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
superintendant and some without right so
 
02:10:49.390 --> 02:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
should we not be identifying that as
 
02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about our so well right
 
02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
now we're not talking about the rules so
 
02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
in theory you have the laws which you
 
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
know authorize the Department of
 
02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
Education or whomever to do something
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
and then you have the rules that provide
 
02:11:04.390 --> 02:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
further definition and Clarity to the
 
02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
law that's the way the rules should work
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
and so um if a law says um you know all
 
02:11:13.629 --> 02:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
non-public schools shall do this and
 
02:11:14.910 --> 02:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
then the Department of Education were to
 
02:11:16.750 --> 02:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
have a rule that then said a non-public
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
school is defined as a private school of
 
02:11:20.990 --> 02:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
this and this you could have kind of
 
02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
those definitions at work um the law the
 
02:11:26.790 --> 02:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
rules the CATE Board of Education rules
 
02:11:29.310 --> 02:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
would absolutely need to be updated
 
02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
after this is recodified as well so
 
02:11:33.470 --> 02:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's step two um but step one is
 
02:11:35.109 --> 02:11:35.119 align:start position:0%
really making sure that the laws
 
02:11:38.030 --> 02:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
themselves make sense and so you're
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
correct so there's sections in law that
 
02:11:41.950 --> 02:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
are confusing because there's sections
 
02:11:44.030 --> 02:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
that say a superintendent shall do this
 
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
and then there's other sections say a
 
02:11:47.229 --> 02:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
superintendent or the design shall do
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
this and then we have the other section
 
02:11:50.589 --> 02:11:50.599 align:start position:0%
of law that talks about superintendent
 
02:11:53.149 --> 02:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
services and is it I you know is it
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
clear that somebody can use
 
02:11:57.189 --> 02:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
superintendent services for something
 
02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
when it says specifically a
 
02:12:00.030 --> 02:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent though those are all
 
02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
great examples of the things that we
 
02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
struggle with on a very regular basis
 
02:12:06.229 --> 02:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
when trying to you know ensure that our
 
02:12:08.109 --> 02:12:08.119 align:start position:0%
constituents have answers to what
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
they're required to do thank you last
 
02:12:12.310 --> 02:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
fall thank you because that has been my
 
02:12:13.990 --> 02:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
concern when I saw that new title come
 
02:12:16.350 --> 02:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
in I couldn't find anywhere in law where
 
02:12:18.870 --> 02:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
a senior education official is in our
 
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
law so I was concerned about why we went
 
02:12:23.390 --> 02:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
with that title at the Department of
 
02:12:25.709 --> 02:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
Education when we specifically have
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent in our law so and I think
 
02:12:32.109 --> 02:12:32.119 align:start position:0%
the question on that with the senior uh
 
02:12:34.750 --> 02:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
education official is more a question so
 
02:12:37.069 --> 02:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
I haven't I'm on the rule side of things
 
02:12:38.430 --> 02:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
I I need to actually go back and read
 
02:12:40.109 --> 02:12:40.119 align:start position:0%
where it says that in the rule but I
 
02:12:41.669 --> 02:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
think we also need to understand when
 
02:12:43.470 --> 02:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education is trying to
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
Define who can do what as far as system
 
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
work so is it only a superintendent that
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
can certify this report and what happens
 
02:12:54.390 --> 02:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
if a school district doesn't have a
 
02:12:57.310 --> 02:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
superintendent at the time so a great
 
02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
example of this is on July 7ish every
 
02:13:05.310 --> 02:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
year schools have to certify a large
 
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
amount of data to the Department of
 
02:13:09.149 --> 02:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
Education um that is used for
 
02:13:10.870 --> 02:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
calculating adequate education grants
 
02:13:15.310 --> 02:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
and everything else um when we do that
 
02:13:17.069 --> 02:13:17.079 align:start position:0%
there have been times and there's
 
02:13:19.270 --> 02:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
probably a few every year where there is
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
not a superintendent employed by by the
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
school district at that time and so who
 
02:13:25.830 --> 02:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
has the authority to do that is it the
 
02:13:29.310 --> 02:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard person or chair or is it um
 
02:13:30.750 --> 02:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
is it an assistant superintendent if
 
02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
they have assistant superintendent and
 
02:13:34.990 --> 02:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
so you kind of using some of those that
 
02:13:37.629 --> 02:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
same terminology has been helpful to the
 
02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
department um and we're kind of working
 
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
on how that impacts our reporting in our
 
02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:52.470 --> 02:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:56.149 --> 02:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
I have no doubt that this is uh a needed
 
02:13:59.629 --> 02:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
project and I also have no doubt that
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's extremely complicated and uh will
 
02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:04.390 align:start position:0%
it's extremely complicated and uh will
take

02:14:04.390 --> 02:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
take
 
02:14:10.510 --> 02:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
time um to identify quote duplication
 
02:14:15.229 --> 02:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
duplicative statutes and need for
 
02:14:15.239 --> 02:14:17.990 align:start position:0%
duplicative statutes and need for
consolidations

02:14:17.990 --> 02:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
consolidations
 
02:14:21.109 --> 02:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
um a concern I have is that you've met
 
02:14:24.910 --> 02:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned OS on several occasions as
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
needing to be involved wanting to be
 
02:14:30.430 --> 02:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
involved um but there's no mention of ol
 
02:14:32.910 --> 02:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
in the bill so I I think um so this is
 
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
the original bill that representative
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
Hill put in a couple years ago that
 
02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
initially caused some concerns and some
 
02:14:40.109 --> 02:14:40.119 align:start position:0%
alarms for OS and that's why I'm making
 
02:14:42.350 --> 02:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
a point to bring them up because we are
 
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
saying we want to work collaboratively
 
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
with them and Os I think is initial
 
02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
concern when they saw this bill was they
 
02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
thought the Department of Education
 
02:14:49.709 --> 02:14:49.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to do this on an island and not
 
02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
concern them um um and so when you know
 
02:14:55.149 --> 02:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
I I went and actually met with Terry
 
02:14:58.270 --> 02:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
paff and a representative from OS and
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
said no we want to do this in
 
02:15:00.990 --> 02:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
collaboration and we've had those
 
02:15:02.990 --> 02:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
conversations then so what you have in
 
02:15:04.589 --> 02:15:04.599 align:start position:0%
front of you absolutely needs an
 
02:15:07.030 --> 02:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
amendment um and you probably needs to
 
02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
change that $100,000 it needs to add you
 
02:15:10.750 --> 02:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
know if if you guys want the fiscal
 
02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
requirement needs to put that in there
 
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
it can say the Department of Education
 
02:15:16.510 --> 02:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
will do an RFP in collaboration with OS
 
02:15:18.350 --> 02:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
all of that is information that could be
 
02:15:20.350 --> 02:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
added in here we need an amendment to
 
02:15:22.669 --> 02:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
this this is the starting ground um and
 
02:15:23.950 --> 02:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can get to something that
 
02:15:26.030 --> 02:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
we can actually get past and start to
 
02:15:28.510 --> 02:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
implement so I'm not sitting here in two
 
02:15:30.030 --> 02:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
years or four years or eight years
 
02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
having the same conversation I follow
 
02:15:36.549 --> 02:15:36.559 align:start position:0%
yes that's good um and I would just
 
02:15:39.669 --> 02:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
underscore that it's not just
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
duplications and
 
02:15:45.229 --> 02:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
contradictions um and
 
02:15:48.430 --> 02:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
consolidations its recommendations for
 
02:15:51.709 --> 02:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation responding to
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
that material which is where policy
 
02:15:59.790 --> 02:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
questions and judgments creep in and um
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
I would particularly want to see not
 
02:16:05.870 --> 02:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
just the commissioner of the Department
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
of Education receiving and acting on
 
02:16:10.990 --> 02:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
that but also
 
02:16:13.790 --> 02:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
OS yeah perhaps something else I agree
 
02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
with you yeah I mean I think that's
 
02:16:16.750 --> 02:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
that's definitely part of that's going
 
02:16:18.430 --> 02:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
to come out of this is the policy side
 
02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
of things so okay just to just to close
 
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
this thing up th this whole idea when I
 
02:16:27.229 --> 02:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
started hearing this years ago was
 
02:16:28.510 --> 02:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
02:16:31.470 --> 02:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
OS they're the ones and now what we've
 
02:16:34.389 --> 02:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
lost is the history over there when it
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
comes to education now we have new folks
 
02:16:39.230 --> 02:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
there when I used to walk in with stuff
 
02:16:41.190 --> 02:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
and I was talking to
 
02:16:45.150 --> 02:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
Anthony he knew where everything was and
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
he knew this is a conflict what are you
 
02:16:49.270 --> 02:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
nuts he say to me you're putting it in
 
02:16:51.150 --> 02:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
the wrong place you're looking for the
 
02:16:52.509 --> 02:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
duties to the board you can find the
 
02:16:54.629 --> 02:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
duties of the board all over the place
 
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
in there so it's hard for the public to
 
02:16:58.950 --> 02:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
find out where things are located as
 
02:17:01.070 --> 02:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
well we need to do this but you're right
 
02:17:02.830 --> 02:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
this is going to have to be
 
02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
Rewritten dealing with you know we're
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
going to put this thing out and trying
 
02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
to figure how much money it's going to
 
02:17:09.389 --> 02:17:09.399 align:start position:0%
cost we need to look at the OS involved
 
02:17:12.509 --> 02:17:12.519 align:start position:0%
them very much in this uh so uh I would
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
suggest that we work hard on an
 
02:17:18.830 --> 02:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
amendment and then move it forward uh
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
because every moment we're losing time
 
02:17:24.549 --> 02:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
we're losing the history and we've had
 
02:17:26.429 --> 02:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
people leave all us saying boy I'd love
 
02:17:29.509 --> 02:17:29.519 align:start position:0%
to have a shot at correcting this but
 
02:17:31.389 --> 02:17:31.399 align:start position:0%
you know they're too now getting engaged
 
02:17:33.870 --> 02:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
in other stuff and we're losing that
 
02:17:37.110 --> 02:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
expertise we need it so thank you very
 
02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:38.150 align:start position:0%
expertise we need it so thank you very
much

02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:17:40.910 --> 02:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
for there what yeah represent luno thank
 
02:17:43.950 --> 02:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
you very much M Mr chair and um and so
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
so since we are based on what you're
 
02:17:48.990 --> 02:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
just saying looking for we'll look to do
 
02:17:52.990 --> 02:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:56.190 --> 02:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
um how do you want to proceed in terms
 
02:18:00.150 --> 02:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
of uh discussing what could go into um
 
02:18:02.349 --> 02:18:02.359 align:start position:0%
that Amendment do you want to do a a a
 
02:18:05.669 --> 02:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
work group or a subcommittee uh on this
 
02:18:07.629 --> 02:18:07.639 align:start position:0%
and try get let me put it to the
 
02:18:10.669 --> 02:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
department right here too um Caitlyn you
 
02:18:12.589 --> 02:18:12.599 align:start position:0%
just been given a pretty good overview
 
02:18:15.629 --> 02:18:15.639 align:start position:0%
of what's right and what's wrong with
 
02:18:18.190 --> 02:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
this is it possible before we put a
 
02:18:20.429 --> 02:18:20.439 align:start position:0%
subcommittee together that a boiler
 
02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
plate proposal could be put together
 
02:18:25.070 --> 02:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
bring it back to us and then we could
 
02:18:26.830 --> 02:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
that gives the subcommittee a place to
 
02:18:29.110 --> 02:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
start working rather than our having to
 
02:18:31.549 --> 02:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
explore all this again you deal with
 
02:18:33.910 --> 02:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
this daily like superintendent you can
 
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
find where you have a single
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent in District it might be a
 
02:18:39.190 --> 02:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
guy with a master's program with
 
02:18:41.230 --> 02:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
expertise a master's program that's
 
02:18:43.150 --> 02:18:43.160 align:start position:0%
related to school finance and those
 
02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
issues that are required they don't have
 
02:18:47.309 --> 02:18:47.319 align:start position:0%
to Neally be a superintendent that's in
 
02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
law already so it's it's complicated
 
02:18:54.309 --> 02:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
so can you do a boil plate for us of
 
02:18:56.389 --> 02:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
what you've discussed today the proc for
 
02:18:59.309 --> 02:18:59.319 align:start position:0%
the amendment just the amendment process
 
02:19:02.910 --> 02:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
for getting this moving yes okay yeah it
 
02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
would be like a like a framework yeah
 
02:19:07.270 --> 02:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
yeah a guideline for us to start working
 
02:19:09.669 --> 02:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
a framework it's good idea yeah and so
 
02:19:11.349 --> 02:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
then we get that and we we'll come back
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
and look at that and if we have to make
 
02:19:15.349 --> 02:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
additions subtractions whatever but
 
02:19:18.389 --> 02:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
it'll allow us to move faster on
 
02:19:22.190 --> 02:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
it any further questions yes yes I just
 
02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
want to say that um there were some
 
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
changes made to to
 
02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
rules the rules Pro not particular rules
 
02:19:37.509 --> 02:19:37.519 align:start position:0%
to the rules process was made um in E
 
02:19:42.830 --> 02:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
Edna worked on that and and I think that
 
02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:44.910 align:start position:0%
Edna worked on that and and I think that
that

02:19:44.910 --> 02:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:19:48.389 --> 02:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
maybe and and they rewrote a Hu the huge
 
02:19:50.270 --> 02:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
you know practically everything that had
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
to do with with making putting rules
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
together and I just think that maybe
 
02:20:01.389 --> 02:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
that would provide some in Insight that
 
02:20:03.070 --> 02:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
the process if you can find out the
 
02:20:06.190 --> 02:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
process that was used to put put that
 
02:20:07.630 --> 02:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
together I mean you have to identify
 
02:20:10.110 --> 02:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
what you need to do first well rules
 
02:20:12.750 --> 02:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
Come From This which we want to rec
 
02:20:17.710 --> 02:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
codify so so it's it's not contradictory
 
02:20:19.790 --> 02:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
throughout they're not going to be
 
02:20:22.910 --> 02:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
rewriting Statute in terms of what we
 
02:20:25.790 --> 02:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
should have that's not their job so you
 
02:20:28.990 --> 02:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
know what what's been done through gel
 
02:20:31.870 --> 02:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
car in in improving
 
02:20:35.469 --> 02:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
rules is our responsibility you know and
 
02:20:36.750 --> 02:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
if we've done something which is
 
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
incorrect it's on us uh so I I I think
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
that what we need to do is do this first
 
02:20:44.670 --> 02:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
step here to get this thing going and
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's where the boiler plate if you
 
02:20:47.710 --> 02:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
bring forward to us the framework so
 
02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:51.319 align:start position:0%
then we can move from there um we don't
 
02:20:52.389 --> 02:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
want to have too many cooks in the
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
kitchen on
 
02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
this it'll go forever so any further
 
02:21:00.070 --> 02:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
before I close this thing down well
 
02:21:02.429 --> 02:21:02.439 align:start position:0%
we're closing down uh 729 and thank you
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
very much today coming over um this is
 
02:21:09.230 --> 02:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
heck of a job if we take it
 
02:21:11.870 --> 02:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
on it's
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
huge it may save money in the long
 
02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
run yeah
 
02:21:19.990 --> 02:21:20.000 align:start position:0%

03:12:37.950 --> 03:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
okay we need to get this thing going
 
03:12:40.469 --> 03:12:40.479 align:start position:0%
here we're a little bit
 
03:12:43.110 --> 03:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
behind and for the afternoon we have
 
03:12:45.910 --> 03:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
broken our our conversation into two
 
03:12:45.920 --> 03:12:47.550 align:start position:0%
broken our our conversation into two
areas

03:12:47.550 --> 03:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
areas
 
03:12:49.630 --> 03:12:49.640 align:start position:0%
uh first one is dealing with the bills
 
03:12:52.309 --> 03:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
which are referencing the meal programs
 
03:12:54.389 --> 03:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
and the second part is starting to get
 
03:12:57.630 --> 03:12:57.640 align:start position:0%
us into the conversation on uh special
 
03:12:57.640 --> 03:12:59.309 align:start position:0%
us into the conversation on uh special
education

03:12:59.309 --> 03:12:59.319 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:13:01.750 --> 03:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
funding so I'd like to start right off
 
03:13:06.229 --> 03:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
with we have 583 646 and 665
 
03:13:09.630 --> 03:13:09.640 align:start position:0%
703 which are all bills which are
 
03:13:12.150 --> 03:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
referencing the meals program let's
 
03:13:13.469 --> 03:13:13.479 align:start position:0%
start off with the first one that's
 
03:13:16.389 --> 03:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
listed there 583 and that's relative to
 
03:13:17.990 --> 03:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid director certification
 
03:13:21.750 --> 03:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
program for free and reduced uh School
 
03:13:25.630 --> 03:13:25.640 align:start position:0%
meals uh so if you have 583 that's the
 
03:13:26.870 --> 03:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
one we're going to be looking at you
 
03:13:30.950 --> 03:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:34.229 --> 03:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
up the bill has been introduced so we
 
03:13:36.710 --> 03:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
should know basically what that bill
 
03:13:39.750 --> 03:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
does so uh we're in a work session right
 
03:13:44.710 --> 03:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
now um if we have technical support here
 
03:13:47.670 --> 03:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh and if there's Henry lintman now you
 
03:13:52.030 --> 03:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
you're here I see so uh perhaps do you
 
03:13:55.790 --> 03:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:58.870 --> 03:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
1:30 so are you here to speak on this
 
03:14:02.469 --> 03:14:02.479 align:start position:0%
583 Bill providing technical
 
03:14:05.750 --> 03:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
support that would be Li okay so why
 
03:14:12.190 --> 03:14:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:14.469 --> 03:14:14.479 align:start position:0%
up now this is not the type of thing
 
03:14:16.190 --> 03:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
where we have to have pin cards like
 
03:14:18.790 --> 03:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
03:14:22.110 --> 03:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
so uh are there are there questions uh
 
03:14:24.510 --> 03:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
for the this is Medicaid direct if you
 
03:14:26.349 --> 03:14:26.359 align:start position:0%
have a few information points you want
 
03:14:29.510 --> 03:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
to convey to us you can do that uh and
 
03:14:31.670 --> 03:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
then we can go from there sure for the
 
03:14:33.349 --> 03:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
record um Henry Litman the state's
 
03:14:36.710 --> 03:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director um I think uh what I
 
03:14:40.590 --> 03:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
can offer to you is whether um a
 
03:14:43.389 --> 03:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
Medicaid application um could have a a
 
03:14:46.030 --> 03:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
designation on it a parent could choose
 
03:14:48.229 --> 03:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
to whe they wanted to enroll their
 
03:14:50.510 --> 03:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
student and free and reduced lunch or
 
03:14:53.870 --> 03:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
not um if assuming they wanted to we
 
03:14:56.429 --> 03:14:56.439 align:start position:0%
have the technical means to transfer
 
03:14:59.469 --> 03:14:59.479 align:start position:0%
that application information over to the
 
03:15:01.750 --> 03:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um and
 
03:15:03.510 --> 03:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
conversations with with Department of
 
03:15:05.110 --> 03:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
Education I believe they have the
 
03:15:08.110 --> 03:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
ability to accept it and to to read it
 
03:15:11.070 --> 03:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
that's about as far as as I can provide
 
03:15:12.590 --> 03:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
technical assistance on terms of the
 
03:15:15.190 --> 03:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
policy or whatever the it's really do we
 
03:15:17.309 --> 03:15:17.319 align:start position:0%
have the ability to you know modif our
 
03:15:19.750 --> 03:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid application with a with a
 
03:15:22.990 --> 03:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
checkbox type of situation yes we do and
 
03:15:24.750 --> 03:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
can we transmit it I think in a form
 
03:15:27.110 --> 03:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's readable by the Department of
 
03:15:30.469 --> 03:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
Education that's also a
 
03:15:33.070 --> 03:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
yes question clarification for everybody
 
03:15:35.510 --> 03:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
here this bill has come before us before
 
03:15:37.710 --> 03:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
in fact it came back in front of Karen
 
03:15:39.590 --> 03:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
umberger's group years
 
03:15:43.469 --> 03:15:43.479 align:start position:0%
ago the question was how do they get
 
03:15:46.670 --> 03:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
permission from the parent to release
 
03:15:49.269 --> 03:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
this information to another
 
03:15:52.790 --> 03:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
agency how do you do that so we would
 
03:15:55.229 --> 03:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
propose a a check the box kind of
 
03:15:56.750 --> 03:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
situation where they could choose
 
03:15:58.510 --> 03:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
whether they want to have it referred or
 
03:16:00.870 --> 03:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
not um and so that would it'd be that
 
03:16:02.710 --> 03:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
kind of simple process they'd have to
 
03:16:06.930 --> 03:16:06.940 align:start position:0%
make an affirmative election on their
 
03:16:06.940 --> 03:16:08.590 align:start position:0%
make an affirmative election on their
[Music]

03:16:08.590 --> 03:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:16:12.229 --> 03:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
application yes uh
 
03:16:15.910 --> 03:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
represent is this kind of check the box
 
03:16:18.630 --> 03:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
process use in other states are you
 
03:16:20.269 --> 03:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
aware of what other states are doing in
 
03:16:23.469 --> 03:16:23.479 align:start position:0%
this regard I'm I'm not familiar as to
 
03:16:26.229 --> 03:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
whether um whether that's how they
 
03:16:28.429 --> 03:16:28.439 align:start position:0%
transmit the information I do know that
 
03:16:30.990 --> 03:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
where they have direct participation
 
03:16:33.910 --> 03:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
they are transmitting information to the
 
03:16:35.389 --> 03:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
equivalent of our Department of
 
03:16:37.870 --> 03:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
Education that I can say how they
 
03:16:40.550 --> 03:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
actually accomplish it you know when you
 
03:16:41.990 --> 03:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
I like to say to people when you've seen
 
03:16:43.710 --> 03:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
one Medicaid Program you've seen one
 
03:16:46.110 --> 03:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program in terms of the
 
03:16:48.790 --> 03:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility system that that is used you
 
03:16:49.950 --> 03:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
know different vendors have different
 
03:16:52.150 --> 03:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
ways of doing things and even within the
 
03:16:54.550 --> 03:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
same vendor depending on the state and
 
03:16:56.429 --> 03:16:56.439 align:start position:0%
the you know the laws and regulations
 
03:17:02.030 --> 03:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:04.229 --> 03:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
differently further any other
 
03:17:07.469 --> 03:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
information yes represent luno so so
 
03:17:11.229 --> 03:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
thanks very much and and um and I think
 
03:17:14.349 --> 03:17:14.359 align:start position:0%
this may have come up uh during the I'm
 
03:17:16.189 --> 03:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
sure this came up during the um during
 
03:17:20.150 --> 03:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
the hearing but um but potentially
 
03:17:24.269 --> 03:17:24.279 align:start position:0%
across the state how many students um in
 
03:17:29.229 --> 03:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
you know ages five to 22 would it be
 
03:17:30.469 --> 03:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
would it include
 
03:17:33.429 --> 03:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
22 to age
 
03:17:37.429 --> 03:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
2222 um could could be eligible to
 
03:17:40.189 --> 03:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
receive a free and reduced price lunch
 
03:17:41.590 --> 03:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
if they check the
 
03:17:44.910 --> 03:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
box so um I know we've provided that
 
03:17:46.070 --> 03:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
information to the Department of
 
03:17:47.510 --> 03:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
Education off the top top of my head I
 
03:17:49.070 --> 03:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
would I didn't sorry I didn't bring that
 
03:17:51.469 --> 03:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
information with me um but it's it's
 
03:17:54.469 --> 03:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
calculated um and we've updated a
 
03:17:56.229 --> 03:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
periodically Department of Education as
 
03:17:59.830 --> 03:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
the bills have come up right right so so
 
03:18:01.389 --> 03:18:01.399 align:start position:0%
I wanted to actually use that question
 
03:18:04.510 --> 03:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
as a way to to introduce just another
 
03:18:07.229 --> 03:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
concept to consider with that I I
 
03:18:10.429 --> 03:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
believe the answer is is about 50,000
 
03:18:13.510 --> 03:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
students would be be eligible is that is
 
03:18:17.670 --> 03:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
that close well the report says 51,00 79
 
03:18:21.710 --> 03:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
okay and um and so that under under
 
03:18:25.389 --> 03:18:25.399 align:start position:0%
current law um in
 
03:18:27.229 --> 03:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
increases and you're probably looking
 
03:18:28.710 --> 03:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
right at the report I'm not looking at
 
03:18:31.309 --> 03:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
it right now would would increase our F
 
03:18:35.030 --> 03:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
frpl free Inu price lunch uh population
 
03:18:39.950 --> 03:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
from about 40,000 to about 51 um th000
 
03:18:41.790 --> 03:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
and um because the state of New
 
03:18:44.550 --> 03:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire also uses the free and reduced
 
03:18:47.830 --> 03:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
price lunch population as part of the
 
03:18:51.030 --> 03:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
school funding formula there would be a
 
03:18:54.229 --> 03:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
corresponding uh increase in uh in
 
03:18:57.750 --> 03:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy Grant to uh to school districts
 
03:19:00.550 --> 03:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
and so that you know approximately
 
03:19:03.429 --> 03:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
11,000 more students
 
03:19:06.429 --> 03:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
times uh what are we at
 
03:19:09.550 --> 03:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
$2,300 um is that the the differentiated
 
03:19:12.269 --> 03:19:12.279 align:start position:0%
Aid Factor Mr chair something like that
 
03:19:15.670 --> 03:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
are so so so we'd be we'd be talking
 
03:19:20.309 --> 03:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
about about $24 million uh per year and
 
03:19:20.319 --> 03:19:23.110 align:start position:0%
about about $24 million uh per year and
um

03:19:23.110 --> 03:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:28.550 --> 03:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
though plus extraordinary needs yes and
 
03:19:36.229 --> 03:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
so so so that would in increase the
 
03:19:39.189 --> 03:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
grant um to that so I passed around an
 
03:19:41.950 --> 03:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
amendment and this is actually after um
 
03:19:44.309 --> 03:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
I uh after talking with some people
 
03:19:47.790 --> 03:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
about it um and um and you know in light
 
03:19:49.750 --> 03:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
of a lot of the conversation we had
 
03:19:52.870 --> 03:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
earlier today on other bills that that
 
03:19:55.309 --> 03:19:55.319 align:start position:0%
look we're coming into a very tight um
 
03:19:56.349 --> 03:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
budget year I actually had a
 
03:19:57.750 --> 03:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
conversation with the governor about
 
03:20:01.910 --> 03:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
this very thing and um and about this
 
03:20:03.910 --> 03:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
this very idea and and I said look if we
 
03:20:06.950 --> 03:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
could make it uh budget neutral uh would
 
03:20:08.389 --> 03:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
that be something that's interesting and
 
03:20:11.710 --> 03:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
she goes that's music to my ears and um
 
03:20:13.670 --> 03:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
and so the amendment that I that I sign
 
03:20:15.309 --> 03:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
out we're not we're not executing right
 
03:20:17.950 --> 03:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
now so so so this is just really for
 
03:20:20.590 --> 03:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
concept so it's Amendment 0
 
03:20:25.110 --> 03:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
314h um uh ports over some language that
 
03:20:28.830 --> 03:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
we had in the 2022
 
03:20:32.110 --> 03:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
23 excuse me you do you have any did the
 
03:20:34.510 --> 03:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
department get a copy of this you got it
 
03:20:37.189 --> 03:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
Mark okay thank you okay go ahead yeah
 
03:20:39.670 --> 03:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
thanks and there's there's there's a
 
03:20:42.070 --> 03:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
stack of them on the on the uh table
 
03:20:44.950 --> 03:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
over there as well so so I believe most
 
03:20:47.150 --> 03:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
I I got them do I think most people but
 
03:20:50.670 --> 03:20:50.680 align:start position:0%
but um but the this adops language that
 
03:20:53.030 --> 03:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
the the amendment adops language that we
 
03:20:57.269 --> 03:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
had in the 22 2022 23 state budget that
 
03:21:00.630 --> 03:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
used prepandemic uh free and reduced
 
03:21:04.429 --> 03:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
price lunch enrollments to calculate the
 
03:21:07.429 --> 03:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
adequacy and the um the I'm not sure we
 
03:21:09.830 --> 03:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
had the the
 
03:21:13.189 --> 03:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:16.910 --> 03:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
um um the extraordinary needs Grant I'm
 
03:21:19.189 --> 03:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
not sure we had that back then but but
 
03:21:22.750 --> 03:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
it used it used the prepandemic numbers
 
03:21:24.710 --> 03:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh rather than numbers from the prior
 
03:21:26.269 --> 03:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
year because the prior year we were on
 
03:21:28.590 --> 03:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
USDA waivers so there there was very
 
03:21:31.269 --> 03:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
little paperwork uh completed we didn't
 
03:21:34.150 --> 03:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
really have accurate counts so so this
 
03:21:35.630 --> 03:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
this basically does the same thing it
 
03:21:38.110 --> 03:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
would use it would use uh free
 
03:21:41.070 --> 03:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
introduced price lunch enrollment from
 
03:21:43.229 --> 03:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
the present from this current school
 
03:21:46.590 --> 03:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
year 2024 25 apply that come up with
 
03:21:49.070 --> 03:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
with a percentage for each um each Town
 
03:21:51.070 --> 03:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
each school district and each member
 
03:21:53.269 --> 03:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
town and then would you hold that
 
03:21:57.830 --> 03:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
percentage for the next two budget years
 
03:21:59.990 --> 03:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh so that they wouldn't be affected by
 
03:22:03.030 --> 03:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
so so the adequacy grant would would
 
03:22:05.269 --> 03:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
essentially not be affected by uh by
 
03:22:07.229 --> 03:22:07.239 align:start position:0%
transition over to Medicaid direct
 
03:22:10.030 --> 03:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
certification so all all MDC would be
 
03:22:13.110 --> 03:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
doing is literally feeding more kids
 
03:22:16.229 --> 03:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
that uh that are qualified for um uh for
 
03:22:19.790 --> 03:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
free free lunch under the the um USDA
 
03:22:22.229 --> 03:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
program and it applies to both the
 
03:22:24.030 --> 03:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy grant as well as the
 
03:22:25.790 --> 03:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant you can see
 
03:22:28.670 --> 03:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
that on lines um 18 and
 
03:22:34.070 --> 03:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:36.510 --> 03:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
amendment are there
 
03:22:38.870 --> 03:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
further Is there further information to
 
03:22:40.910 --> 03:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
get from Henry
 
03:22:43.469 --> 03:22:43.479 align:start position:0%
Litman so he doesn't have to sit there
 
03:22:47.070 --> 03:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:49.550 --> 03:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Henry thank you um
 
03:22:49.560 --> 03:22:55.030 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Henry thank you um
appreciate

03:22:55.030 --> 03:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:58.349 --> 03:22:58.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is open to discussion right
 
03:23:01.389 --> 03:23:01.399 align:start position:0%
now the the this is a work
 
03:23:01.399 --> 03:23:07.670 align:start position:0%
now the the this is a work
session

03:23:07.670 --> 03:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:10.590 --> 03:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
um yes represent spillsbury
 
03:23:13.309 --> 03:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to direct this question to
 
03:23:16.269 --> 03:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
representative luno just if I'm
 
03:23:17.710 --> 03:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
understand understanding what you were
 
03:23:19.349 --> 03:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
saying you're saying that this
 
03:23:23.189 --> 03:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
calculation for 2425 school year will
 
03:23:25.550 --> 03:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
then will be captured and used before
 
03:23:27.269 --> 03:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid
 
03:23:30.510 --> 03:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
certification uh enhances the student
 
03:23:33.710 --> 03:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
count yeah I mean the the intent is for
 
03:23:38.150 --> 03:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
it to be there um to uh not to be there
 
03:23:40.750 --> 03:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
before it but to be there as the
 
03:23:42.189 --> 03:23:42.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct
 
03:23:45.990 --> 03:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
certification um uh enrolls more
 
03:23:48.510 --> 03:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
students in free and reduced price lunch
 
03:23:51.110 --> 03:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so it would it would keep the the
 
03:23:53.990 --> 03:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy calculation essentially in the
 
03:23:55.710 --> 03:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
the the same way we've been doing so
 
03:23:57.349 --> 03:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
that you can increase the number
 
03:23:59.349 --> 03:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
qualifying for free and reduced lunch
 
03:24:02.469 --> 03:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
without having it Ripple through to the
 
03:24:06.469 --> 03:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula and the um
 
03:24:08.750 --> 03:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant that's correct
 
03:24:10.670 --> 03:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
to keep it budget neutral but I suppose
 
03:24:15.110 --> 03:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
then two years after that then those
 
03:24:17.469 --> 03:24:17.479 align:start position:0%
calculations would C catch up with the
 
03:24:20.830 --> 03:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh increased number correct un unless
 
03:24:23.750 --> 03:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:26.469 --> 03:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
then from the depart Department Mark do
 
03:24:32.950 --> 03:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:37.150 --> 03:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
there have you calculated by if we got
 
03:24:39.750 --> 03:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
involved in this program without looking
 
03:24:41.710 --> 03:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
at that amendment that represent luno
 
03:24:45.510 --> 03:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
just introduced what would be the total
 
03:24:48.990 --> 03:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
gain uh cost to that program including
 
03:24:53.990 --> 03:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
our current amount for f&amp;r which is what
 
03:24:56.030 --> 03:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
that's around
 
03:25:00.070 --> 03:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
97 uh yeah 97 million so no yeah in the
 
03:25:02.790 --> 03:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs which is 180
 
03:25:05.710 --> 03:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
something million dollars so um uh the
 
03:25:07.469 --> 03:25:07.479 align:start position:0%
short answer is we don't know how
 
03:25:08.830 --> 03:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
without the actual data we don't know
 
03:25:11.070 --> 03:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
how many students we would pick up um
 
03:25:12.590 --> 03:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
but doing the fiscal note walks through
 
03:25:14.030 --> 03:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
a methodology that is you know
 
03:25:16.910 --> 03:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable enough um in our our our
 
03:25:20.070 --> 03:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
estimate is fiscal year 28 and I'll talk
 
03:25:21.309 --> 03:25:21.319 align:start position:0%
about the timeline of the program but
 
03:25:24.389 --> 03:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 28 District adequacy ballp
 
03:25:26.070 --> 03:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
park number would go up by about 50
 
03:25:29.910 --> 03:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
million so that is the uh uh most uh
 
03:25:31.790 --> 03:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
significant financial impact is the 50
 
03:25:33.790 --> 03:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
million increase inadequacy based on
 
03:25:36.510 --> 03:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
finding around 10,000 is additional
 
03:25:38.309 --> 03:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
students through Medicaid direct
 
03:25:40.590 --> 03:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
certification uh the reason why it
 
03:25:42.510 --> 03:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
impacts fiscal year 28 is because the
 
03:25:45.189 --> 03:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
timeline of the program so if this bill
 
03:25:47.790 --> 03:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
were to pass as introduced and as
 
03:25:52.830 --> 03:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
amended um uh we would enter the program
 
03:25:54.710 --> 03:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
we would seek application to be in the
 
03:25:57.830 --> 03:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
program the fall September 25 so this
 
03:25:59.790 --> 03:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
upcoming fall we would see to get
 
03:26:01.590 --> 03:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
application then the students would
 
03:26:03.269 --> 03:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
start direct certifying during school
 
03:26:06.550 --> 03:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
year um 2627 that's when the
 
03:26:08.309 --> 03:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
certification would start happening
 
03:26:09.030 --> 03:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
that's when the program would
 
03:26:12.269 --> 03:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
essentially be enacted and then 2627
 
03:26:15.710 --> 03:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
that would impact 2728 District adequacy
 
03:26:18.269 --> 03:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
so even if you were to pass this speed
 
03:26:20.469 --> 03:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
speed pass this right now um it would
 
03:26:23.349 --> 03:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
still only impact District adequacy till
 
03:26:27.110 --> 03:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
school year 28 uh um fiscal year 28 so
 
03:26:29.950 --> 03:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
any language you want to uh put here to
 
03:26:32.710 --> 03:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh um you'd want to sync up those school
 
03:26:34.550 --> 03:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
years to be consistent with how it
 
03:26:36.830 --> 03:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
impact the funding formula in this
 
03:26:39.229 --> 03:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
amendment but um yeah essentially the
 
03:26:40.990 --> 03:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
impact is is $50
 
03:26:44.630 --> 03:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
million um to District adequacy it also
 
03:26:47.189 --> 03:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
um hypothetically could uh charter
 
03:26:49.030 --> 03:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
school and education Freedom account
 
03:26:51.150 --> 03:26:51.160 align:start position:0%
adequacy but um not at as big a
 
03:26:55.590 --> 03:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:58.030 --> 03:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy how many how many states do you
 
03:27:00.389 --> 03:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
know that are doing this right now I
 
03:27:03.269 --> 03:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
know that we got to apply who approves
 
03:27:05.550 --> 03:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
the application to do this it's a it's a
 
03:27:18.070 --> 03:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:20.590 --> 03:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
further any questions of the department
 
03:27:24.910 --> 03:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
on this from anybody here yes represent
 
03:27:28.750 --> 03:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you um do you know if um
 
03:27:30.750 --> 03:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch is still being
 
03:27:33.510 --> 03:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
used in the title one allocation formula
 
03:27:36.910 --> 03:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
uh it is so um f fnr data is used for a
 
03:27:39.070 --> 03:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
lot of different allocations um but with
 
03:27:41.950 --> 03:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
Title One it wouldn't have no uh
 
03:27:43.870 --> 03:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
positive or negative impact it would
 
03:27:45.710 --> 03:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
just change how we allocate out the the
 
03:27:50.070 --> 03:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
lumps some money that comes in so um um
 
03:27:52.030 --> 03:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
if your town had a lot of students who
 
03:27:55.189 --> 03:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
were on Medicaid but not if not filling
 
03:27:57.670 --> 03:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
out the fnr form um under this program
 
03:27:58.830 --> 03:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
your percentage would go up and
 
03:28:00.630 --> 03:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
therefore you'd get a higher percentage
 
03:28:02.349 --> 03:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
of this C1 Grand that's how that would
 
03:28:05.950 --> 03:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
just follow up and and if you Ju Just to
 
03:28:08.070 --> 03:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
just so we all understand what's going
 
03:28:11.110 --> 03:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
on so Title One allocation the amount to
 
03:28:13.710 --> 03:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
be allocated is a fixed amount so if one
 
03:28:16.229 --> 03:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
go one District it goes up in some other
 
03:28:18.150 --> 03:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
District it'll have to go down correct
 
03:28:19.790 --> 03:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
so no net no net impact but your
 
03:28:21.309 --> 03:28:21.319 align:start position:0%
allocation would change that's correct
 
03:28:23.070 --> 03:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
can you just tell us if you know other
 
03:28:24.950 --> 03:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
ways that it's being used well I'd like
 
03:28:27.429 --> 03:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
to cut in here just Carl Perkins Carl
 
03:28:29.309 --> 03:28:29.319 align:start position:0%
Perkins um so when we're talking about
 
03:28:31.150 --> 03:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
Career Technical education how would
 
03:28:34.349 --> 03:28:34.359 align:start position:0%
that this impact the Carl Perkins so no
 
03:28:36.590 --> 03:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
net change to the bottom line from a
 
03:28:38.389 --> 03:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
Statewide perspective but as represented
 
03:28:39.990 --> 03:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
fellas was uh discussing it would change
 
03:28:42.269 --> 03:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
the allocations so if you happened in
 
03:28:43.990 --> 03:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
your community to have a lot of Medicaid
 
03:28:46.750 --> 03:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
students um that were not fnr snap tan
 
03:28:49.790 --> 03:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
if your percentage would go up and if
 
03:28:51.469 --> 03:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
your percentage went up and your peer
 
03:28:53.429 --> 03:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
somewhere it's got to fall down so
 
03:28:54.990 --> 03:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
because it's so the allocations would
 
03:28:56.630 --> 03:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
change so you'd see a little bit of
 
03:28:59.429 --> 03:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
Shifting I I can't talk to the speak to
 
03:29:00.670 --> 03:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
the magnitude but I wouldn't expect a
 
03:29:02.790 --> 03:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
huge magnitude shift in in allocations
 
03:29:05.550 --> 03:29:05.560 align:start position:0%
so you're correcting something I always
 
03:29:07.389 --> 03:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
thought the other way I thought the
 
03:29:10.269 --> 03:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
number of people we had which were
 
03:29:13.070 --> 03:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
qualify as poverty impacted the amount
 
03:29:15.309 --> 03:29:15.319 align:start position:0%
of money given to us by given granted to
 
03:29:16.790 --> 03:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
us by the feds
 
03:29:19.870 --> 03:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
um that no okay no the only the only the
 
03:29:22.590 --> 03:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
only uh uh uh funding component that I'm
 
03:29:24.670 --> 03:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
aware of and I'm I'm I'd say I'm fairly
 
03:29:26.150 --> 03:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
confident but I'm 100% confident because
 
03:29:27.550 --> 03:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
there's so many different aspects of it
 
03:29:29.510 --> 03:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
but I'm only aware of adequacy where
 
03:29:31.670 --> 03:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
that would actually go up um actually go
 
03:29:33.670 --> 03:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
up by count the rest of it's allocations
 
03:29:36.030 --> 03:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
and if it's allocations it's a lump sum
 
03:29:37.510 --> 03:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
of money that gets allocated out based
 
03:29:39.269 --> 03:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
on fnr
 
03:29:42.830 --> 03:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
percentages ref and Luna so thanks very
 
03:29:45.229 --> 03:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
much and thanks Mark also I I don't know
 
03:29:48.110 --> 03:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
if you can on this but I um there may
 
03:29:49.750 --> 03:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
have been testimony on this during the
 
03:29:52.150 --> 03:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
the hearing but um but I think the
 
03:29:54.950 --> 03:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
number of the number of free introduced
 
03:29:57.910 --> 03:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
price lunch enrollment Statewide could
 
03:30:01.389 --> 03:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
affect uh another um grant called the
 
03:30:03.950 --> 03:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
child care
 
03:30:06.870 --> 03:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship is there any is that a DHHS
 
03:30:09.950 --> 03:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
Grant I I I don't know
 
03:30:12.550 --> 03:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
but yeah I can't speak to that DH just
 
03:30:15.189 --> 03:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
grant so maybe Laura can speak to that
 
03:30:17.510 --> 03:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
when yeah we're done with the deal yeah
 
03:30:19.389 --> 03:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
but but it it's I think it's another
 
03:30:22.030 --> 03:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
area where where if you see an increase
 
03:30:24.510 --> 03:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
in um in free and reduced price lunch
 
03:30:26.910 --> 03:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
enrollment then you then you'll see more
 
03:30:29.870 --> 03:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
money uh appropriated to the child care
 
03:30:32.150 --> 03:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
scholarship which will help families you
 
03:30:35.950 --> 03:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
know in every city and town across the
 
03:30:38.990 --> 03:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
state in the education space I'm fairly
 
03:30:40.710 --> 03:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
confident just adequacy would increase
 
03:30:41.790 --> 03:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount the rest would be
 
03:30:44.030 --> 03:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
allocations but that's good to point
 
03:30:47.950 --> 03:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:52.670 --> 03:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I I Mark job I would want to
 
03:30:56.349 --> 03:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
see second written
 
03:30:56.359 --> 03:30:58.110 align:start position:0%
see second written
into

03:30:58.110 --> 03:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:31:00.750 --> 03:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
form it
 
03:31:00.760 --> 03:31:05.269 align:start position:0%
form it
and

03:31:05.269 --> 03:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:05.279 --> 03:31:07.790 align:start position:0%
 
whatever

03:31:07.790 --> 03:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:31:13.710 --> 03:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
because of numbers so important to to
 
03:31:18.189 --> 03:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
put it in the adequacy form explain why
 
03:31:21.590 --> 03:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
some of those why they don't match other
 
03:31:21.600 --> 03:31:25.670 align:start position:0%
some of those why they don't match other
you

03:31:25.670 --> 03:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:28.670 --> 03:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
know that's a stylistic decision I think
 
03:31:30.790 --> 03:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
either way functionally works the same
 
03:31:32.189 --> 03:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
but that's a a
 
03:31:34.750 --> 03:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
style different style of doing
 
03:31:38.030 --> 03:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
it any other information we'd like to
 
03:31:43.269 --> 03:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:47.990 --> 03:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
time not see any hands flying here Mark
 
03:31:50.710 --> 03:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
um the Kelly Rambo's here and Melissa
 
03:31:54.870 --> 03:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
white director white um uh of course
 
03:31:57.189 --> 03:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
this impacts the nutrition program so
 
03:31:59.189 --> 03:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
more people ignore students accessing
 
03:32:00.950 --> 03:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
meals would cause more Federal
 
03:32:03.389 --> 03:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of meals those meals um so
 
03:32:04.950 --> 03:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
if you need questions relative to the
 
03:32:06.830 --> 03:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
nutrition impacts of this program uh
 
03:32:08.870 --> 03:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
Kelly Rambo is here oh we'd like to hear
 
03:32:16.830 --> 03:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:21.070 --> 03:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
to to Mark no to Kelly I'd like to make
 
03:32:23.269 --> 03:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
some remarks about the nutrition oh okay
 
03:32:23.279 --> 03:32:26.389 align:start position:0%
some remarks about the nutrition oh okay
okay

03:32:26.389 --> 03:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:28.750 --> 03:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
okay so anybody else from the Department
 
03:32:31.950 --> 03:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
is going to help us on the nutrition
 
03:32:39.510 --> 03:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:41.950 --> 03:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
it good afternoon Kelly Rambo from the
 
03:32:43.389 --> 03:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Education Bureau of
 
03:32:47.349 --> 03:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:49.910 --> 03:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
um I can speak to any questions
 
03:32:53.790 --> 03:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
particular to the um nutrition side for
 
03:32:56.189 --> 03:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid or hopefully answer your
 
03:32:59.030 --> 03:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
questions um for the Medicaid direct
 
03:33:02.110 --> 03:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
program okay are there any
 
03:33:04.229 --> 03:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
03:33:09.349 --> 03:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
D thank you Mr chair um so just for
 
03:33:11.309 --> 03:33:11.319 align:start position:0%
committee members who may not be aware
 
03:33:13.189 --> 03:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
I'm a retired dietitian diabetes
 
03:33:14.830 --> 03:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
educator and my mom was a school lunch
 
03:33:16.790 --> 03:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
director a long time ago so my questions
 
03:33:19.830 --> 03:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
come from that background as well as
 
03:33:22.469 --> 03:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
interest in feeding kids thank you for
 
03:33:24.429 --> 03:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
being here to help us with
 
03:33:27.429 --> 03:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
this could you give us some background
 
03:33:30.309 --> 03:33:30.319 align:start position:0%
about the difference in the nutritional
 
03:33:33.389 --> 03:33:33.399 align:start position:0%
composition of item served in the school
 
03:33:36.830 --> 03:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
meal program compared to the same named
 
03:33:39.030 --> 03:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
item in the retail
 
03:33:41.870 --> 03:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
Marketplace like a donut versus a donut
 
03:33:44.349 --> 03:33:44.359 align:start position:0%
or a pancake or whatever could you just
 
03:33:47.150 --> 03:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
comment on that um sure I can touch upon
 
03:33:48.830 --> 03:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
upon that um and thank you for the
 
03:33:53.750 --> 03:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
question the um federal guidelines um do
 
03:33:56.229 --> 03:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
have specific calorie limits sodium
 
03:33:59.469 --> 03:33:59.479 align:start position:0%
limits fat limits um and that depends
 
03:34:02.349 --> 03:34:02.359 align:start position:0%
upon what grade the student might be in
 
03:34:04.189 --> 03:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
that is eating it it's also dependent
 
03:34:08.229 --> 03:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
upon um daily averages versus um weekly
 
03:34:10.990 --> 03:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
averages depending also if you operate a
 
03:34:14.110 --> 03:34:14.120 align:start position:0%
4-day school week or a 5-day school week
 
03:34:15.429 --> 03:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
um so there are a lot of things to take
 
03:34:17.429 --> 03:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
into consideration um that the federal
 
03:34:20.030 --> 03:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
government has put into place for that
 
03:34:23.990 --> 03:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
um the the vendors that would produce a
 
03:34:27.510 --> 03:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
product that is um shelf stable or ready
 
03:34:30.750 --> 03:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
to go um as as you would call it in um
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
school um do have to Fe meet those
 
03:34:36.910 --> 03:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines um and they do look different
 
03:34:40.590 --> 03:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
than um what a offthe shelf product
 
03:34:42.790 --> 03:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
might be as well too that have to meet a
 
03:34:45.750 --> 03:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
different set of dietary guidelines um
 
03:34:48.469 --> 03:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
so there are definitely differences um
 
03:34:52.030 --> 03:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:55.790 --> 03:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
them further questions can I go a little
 
03:35:01.110 --> 03:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
more detail on that sure thank you so um
 
03:35:03.750 --> 03:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
just because this has come up both the
 
03:35:05.670 --> 03:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
other day when we were hearing the bill
 
03:35:10.429 --> 03:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
and on similar bills in past years um I
 
03:35:12.110 --> 03:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
really want to just highlight for folks
 
03:35:15.349 --> 03:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
how significantly different they are the
 
03:35:17.750 --> 03:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
new utri s that are most deficient in
 
03:35:21.269 --> 03:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
children and teens are iron vitamin D
 
03:35:24.790 --> 03:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
calcium zinc magnesium fiber and
 
03:35:26.910 --> 03:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
potassium all of which are critically
 
03:35:29.070 --> 03:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
important to cognitive function and
 
03:35:30.550 --> 03:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
health and
 
03:35:36.189 --> 03:35:36.199 align:start position:0%
well-being so one example a same siiz
 
03:35:36.199 --> 03:35:38.670 align:start position:0%
well-being so one example a same siiz
doughnut

03:35:38.670 --> 03:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
doughnut
 
03:35:40.750 --> 03:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
store-bought generally is going to have
 
03:35:43.670 --> 03:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
white flour no whole grain therefore no
 
03:35:48.710 --> 03:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
fiber 2 migs of iron iron 120 of calcium
 
03:35:53.150 --> 03:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
56 of potassium and the school donut is
 
03:35:56.630 --> 03:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
Hoy flour doesn't seem like it is you
 
03:35:59.990 --> 03:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
can't recognize it as such in the way
 
03:36:02.469 --> 03:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
the texture is or or The Taste but it's
 
03:36:04.910 --> 03:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
Hoy flour which means that whole grain
 
03:36:07.110 --> 03:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
component goes from zero to just under
 
03:36:12.189 --> 03:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
18 gram the iron goes from 2 to 10 Mig
 
03:36:15.110 --> 03:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
the calcium goes up 30 Mig and the
 
03:36:19.150 --> 03:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
potassium more than doubles so it looks
 
03:36:20.870 --> 03:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
like it it's understandable that folks
 
03:36:23.830 --> 03:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
would look at many of the items in the
 
03:36:25.510 --> 03:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
menus and think well we're not feeding
 
03:36:28.790 --> 03:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
kids very good food but this is one
 
03:36:30.269 --> 03:36:30.279 align:start position:0%
example of
 
03:36:32.590 --> 03:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
many where the food is actually
 
03:36:34.910 --> 03:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
profoundly more nutritious than what we
 
03:36:38.189 --> 03:36:38.199 align:start position:0%
perceive it to be um so I think it's
 
03:36:41.830 --> 03:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
important to be aware of that and in the
 
03:36:43.790 --> 03:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
handouts that I circulated that the top
 
03:36:46.630 --> 03:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
page is a menu from the Clarmont Middle
 
03:36:51.150 --> 03:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
School um from what's two two weeks
 
03:36:55.790 --> 03:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
front back um the next two pages of that
 
03:36:58.870 --> 03:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
are the standards the requirements for
 
03:37:00.990 --> 03:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
the breakfast program and the school
 
03:37:03.550 --> 03:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
lunch program and you can see um as
 
03:37:05.950 --> 03:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
Rambo mentioned three different levels
 
03:37:07.590 --> 03:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
so there's a standard of how much food
 
03:37:11.510 --> 03:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
of each category for K to 5 6 to 8 and 9
 
03:37:11.520 --> 03:37:12.309 align:start position:0%
of each category for K to 5 6 to 8 and 9
to

03:37:12.309 --> 03:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:37:15.229 --> 03:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
12 um and it's broken down in terms of
 
03:37:17.309 --> 03:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
the requirements for particular amounts
 
03:37:19.550 --> 03:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
of different kinds of vegetables over
 
03:37:22.790 --> 03:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
the course of the week um and just
 
03:37:25.349 --> 03:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
because I always found this sort of
 
03:37:27.550 --> 03:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
puzzling at first not to get in the
 
03:37:30.590 --> 03:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
weeds but in the footnotes it talks
 
03:37:32.830 --> 03:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
about for some items that the minimum
 
03:37:34.550 --> 03:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
credible serving meaning credible that
 
03:37:37.110 --> 03:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
you can count it towards the school meal
 
03:37:39.229 --> 03:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
requirements is an eighth of a cup
 
03:37:41.030 --> 03:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's because a meal might have a bunch
 
03:37:43.910 --> 03:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
of different items so say you had tacos
 
03:37:46.389 --> 03:37:46.399 align:start position:0%
and it had lettuce and tomatoes and
 
03:37:47.790 --> 03:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
onions and
 
03:37:49.870 --> 03:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
peppers you wouldn't have a half a cup
 
03:37:51.830 --> 03:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
of each one you'd have an eighth of a
 
03:37:55.309 --> 03:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
cup of each one to Total the required
 
03:37:55.319 --> 03:37:57.870 align:start position:0%
cup of each one to Total the required
amount

03:37:57.870 --> 03:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
amount
 
03:38:01.150 --> 03:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
um the data on actually I'm going to ask
 
03:38:03.870 --> 03:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
M rainbow can you speak about the data
 
03:38:08.389 --> 03:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
on the difference in nutrition between
 
03:38:11.349 --> 03:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
the school lunch meals and what kids are
 
03:38:12.750 --> 03:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
eating if they're not having school
 
03:38:14.150 --> 03:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
lunch I don't know if you have that
 
03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
available um I
 
03:38:32.910 --> 03:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:36.510 --> 03:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
available so in the page that single
 
03:38:37.990 --> 03:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
page looks like
 
03:38:41.269 --> 03:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
this um nicely provided to us from
 
03:38:41.279 --> 03:38:43.030 align:start position:0%
this um nicely provided to us from
Hunger

03:38:43.030 --> 03:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
Hunger
 
03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
Solutions you can see the score scoring
 
03:38:49.550 --> 03:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
the rightand bar graph um when they
 
03:38:52.070 --> 03:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
score the nutrition quality of lunches
 
03:38:53.790 --> 03:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
from home versus school
 
03:38:56.550 --> 03:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
lunches and this is data over a long
 
03:38:58.150 --> 03:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
period of time I remember knowing this
 
03:39:00.990 --> 03:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
when my kids were in their 30s were in
 
03:39:04.830 --> 03:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
school um lunches from home across the
 
03:39:06.389 --> 03:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
board are less nutritious than the
 
03:39:07.950 --> 03:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
school lunch
 
03:39:10.469 --> 03:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
program partly because the people who
 
03:39:12.630 --> 03:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
qualify for the free and reduced meals
 
03:39:15.030 --> 03:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources at home to be
 
03:39:17.630 --> 03:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
buying the fresh food that is served in
 
03:39:20.429 --> 03:39:20.439 align:start position:0%
the program so they're generally not
 
03:39:22.990 --> 03:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
putting fresh fruit an abundant amount
 
03:39:24.790 --> 03:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
of vegetables they're usually not using
 
03:39:26.670 --> 03:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
lean protein sources because fatty
 
03:39:28.950 --> 03:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
protein sources are cheaper and the
 
03:39:31.910 --> 03:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
sodium content is way way above what the
 
03:39:35.229 --> 03:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
school lunch sodium content is so I
 
03:39:36.950 --> 03:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to hijack the work session
 
03:39:40.429 --> 03:39:40.439 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to provide background input
 
03:39:43.030 --> 03:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
now or later for anybody who wants
 
03:39:46.710 --> 03:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
it can you just fill in whatever else
 
03:39:49.510 --> 03:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
you would like us to be aware of oh
 
03:39:52.269 --> 03:39:52.279 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't want it be a oneway street
 
03:39:55.510 --> 03:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
here questions and maybe trying to go
 
03:39:58.830 --> 03:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
ahead yeah so so thanks thank you Mr
 
03:40:01.590 --> 03:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks um as always for for
 
03:40:05.150 --> 03:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
joining us so if if there's 10 or 11,000
 
03:40:07.229 --> 03:40:07.239 align:start position:0%
um additional kids that would come into
 
03:40:10.670 --> 03:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
the program qualifying for let let's say
 
03:40:12.550 --> 03:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
free lunch just because I think most of
 
03:40:14.469 --> 03:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
the kids in the program are free lunch
 
03:40:17.269 --> 03:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
not free not reduce but but just to just
 
03:40:19.870 --> 03:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
to keep the math simple what does what
 
03:40:22.950 --> 03:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
does that mean I mean I know you know
 
03:40:24.870 --> 03:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
there's 180 days of school but not
 
03:40:26.670 --> 03:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
everybody's in school every day and not
 
03:40:28.429 --> 03:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
everybody eats the school lunch every
 
03:40:32.469 --> 03:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
day but but um but um and maybe that's
 
03:40:34.189 --> 03:40:34.199 align:start position:0%
sort of like rounder what I'm really
 
03:40:36.469 --> 03:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
trying to get at is is what sort of
 
03:40:39.550 --> 03:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
funding what sort of increase in USDA
 
03:40:42.630 --> 03:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
funding would this mean that would help
 
03:40:46.429 --> 03:40:46.439 align:start position:0%
families pocketbooks reduce their cost
 
03:40:49.070 --> 03:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
um so that would be and you said for
 
03:40:52.950 --> 03:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
sorry 10 10,000 is kids you know coming
 
03:40:57.429 --> 03:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
to school for you know 160 days each or
 
03:40:59.189 --> 03:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
or eating e you know coming where
 
03:41:02.150 --> 03:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
they're eating meals may we say 150 days
 
03:41:06.990 --> 03:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
150 days eating breakfast and lunch um
 
03:41:10.070 --> 03:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
03:41:13.429 --> 03:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
so let's just hypothetically say on an
 
03:41:15.950 --> 03:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
average um a breakfast might be at the
 
03:41:19.710 --> 03:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
local level for a paid um paid meal um
 
03:41:23.070 --> 03:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
between a do to let's say $2 because
 
03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
that is also figured out at the local
 
03:41:27.030 --> 03:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
level so that could be um the cost
 
03:41:29.189 --> 03:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
savings for a family um just for
 
03:41:31.750 --> 03:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
breakfast and then for lunch it can
 
03:41:36.070 --> 03:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
range from um 225 to uh let's just say
 
03:41:38.710 --> 03:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
$4 um so that could be a cost savings
 
03:41:42.189 --> 03:41:42.199 align:start position:0%
per lunch per student so um with that
 
03:41:44.429 --> 03:41:44.439 align:start position:0%
average let's say if they did get
 
03:41:47.349 --> 03:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch it could be2 to
 
03:41:51.550 --> 03:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
maybe $8 um you know per per day um and
 
03:41:54.510 --> 03:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
those are just rough um five bucks would
 
03:41:56.910 --> 03:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
be sort of a good a good happy medium
 
03:42:01.750 --> 03:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
there times 10,000 kids so so $50,000 a
 
03:42:06.149 --> 03:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
day in in in relief to families across
 
03:42:08.309 --> 03:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
the state times potentially times you
 
03:42:11.429 --> 03:42:11.439 align:start position:0%
know how many every day you know 150 to
 
03:42:16.670 --> 03:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
180 days potentially yes great
 
03:42:18.990 --> 03:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks Mark thanks Mark
 
03:42:21.990 --> 03:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
yeah are there any additional costs to
 
03:42:24.149 --> 03:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
the local districts if we went with this
 
03:42:26.189 --> 03:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
program for serving this food preparing
 
03:42:26.199 --> 03:42:27.229 align:start position:0%
program for serving this food preparing
this

03:42:27.229 --> 03:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:42:30.630 --> 03:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
food um there's always the the potential
 
03:42:33.670 --> 03:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
um for that there there could be an
 
03:42:37.710 --> 03:42:37.720 align:start position:0%
increased cost um beneficially um for
 
03:42:39.750 --> 03:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
those students that possibly didn't get
 
03:42:41.510 --> 03:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
breakfast before and now they do qualify
 
03:42:44.110 --> 03:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
for breakfast um maybe they chose not to
 
03:42:46.670 --> 03:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
participate for because they couldn't
 
03:42:48.510 --> 03:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
afford it but now if they they are
 
03:42:50.550 --> 03:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
qualified on this program there could be
 
03:42:52.670 --> 03:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
additional meals um that that would need
 
03:42:54.349 --> 03:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
to be made at the local level so there
 
03:42:57.670 --> 03:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
is the potential for um an additional
 
03:43:01.550 --> 03:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
cost at the local level I noticed in the
 
03:43:03.830 --> 03:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note there are additional
 
03:43:07.189 --> 03:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
costs for the Department of Education
 
03:43:09.910 --> 03:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
and administering this
 
03:43:12.389 --> 03:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
program so I'm I was just curious to
 
03:43:15.630 --> 03:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
know on the local level whether this is
 
03:43:18.349 --> 03:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
going to C cost more in terms of those
 
03:43:20.830 --> 03:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
preparing it or administering or the
 
03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
added dollars in a large District like a
 
03:43:26.870 --> 03:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester um is this going to be more
 
03:43:29.149 --> 03:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
administrative cost for
 
03:43:32.389 --> 03:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
them there is the the potential um you
 
03:43:35.030 --> 03:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
know for for that as as well too I think
 
03:43:37.110 --> 03:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
with any increase program there there
 
03:43:40.710 --> 03:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
does come some um some costs that um
 
03:43:43.429 --> 03:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
again would be beneficial to to the
 
03:43:45.510 --> 03:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
students um in that case but there's
 
03:43:47.870 --> 03:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
always that possibility of potential um
 
03:43:53.590 --> 03:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
costs and um as previously stated if a a
 
03:43:56.070 --> 03:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
district or a school does not offer
 
03:44:00.189 --> 03:44:00.199 align:start position:0%
breakfast um let's just say and we um
 
03:44:02.110 --> 03:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
operate this program and they'd like to
 
03:44:04.189 --> 03:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
start a breakfast program that could
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
also be a potential cost because they do
 
03:44:08.070 --> 03:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
see that there's more students that
 
03:44:11.030 --> 03:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
qualify um so they would like to bring a
 
03:44:12.429 --> 03:44:12.439 align:start position:0%
breakfast program in there that they
 
03:44:16.309 --> 03:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
possibly didn't have before so Mr chair
 
03:44:19.070 --> 03:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
yes yeah just while while we're on this
 
03:44:21.389 --> 03:44:21.399 align:start position:0%
um talking about cost to the district
 
03:44:23.630 --> 03:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
let's also talk about the other side of
 
03:44:26.750 --> 03:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
the the you know the the profit line on
 
03:44:30.269 --> 03:44:30.279 align:start position:0%
this so we talked about uh School
 
03:44:32.110 --> 03:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch cost and I think we
 
03:44:33.790 --> 03:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
even said I think I use the word happy
 
03:44:35.870 --> 03:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
medium was five bucks if you did both
 
03:44:37.870 --> 03:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
you know a buck for breakfast four bucks
 
03:44:39.790 --> 03:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
for lunch I think you there's certainly
 
03:44:43.429 --> 03:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
a range but but that was it um happy
 
03:44:45.790 --> 03:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
happy medium there is is what that's
 
03:44:47.670 --> 03:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
what the school would normally charge
 
03:44:52.990 --> 03:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
that's full price full price um for for
 
03:44:55.070 --> 03:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
a free breakfast and a free lunch for
 
03:44:57.630 --> 03:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
both meals total could be five bucks
 
03:44:59.189 --> 03:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
Buck for the breakfast four bucks for
 
03:45:02.510 --> 03:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
lunch but you you looking at the
 
03:45:04.870 --> 03:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
information from Hunger Solutions the
 
03:45:07.590 --> 03:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
school would get actually get reimbursed
 
03:45:10.590 --> 03:45:10.600 align:start position:0%
$237 for a breakfast it charges full
 
03:45:10.600 --> 03:45:11.990 align:start position:0%
$237 for a breakfast it charges full
price

03:45:11.990 --> 03:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
price
 
03:45:14.950 --> 03:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
for for a dollar they're going to get $2
 
03:45:14.960 --> 03:45:15.750 align:start position:0%
for for a dollar they're going to get $2
$

03:45:15.750 --> 03:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
$
 
03:45:19.670 --> 03:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
37 and for a lunch that they charge four
 
03:45:22.550 --> 03:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
bucks for a full price they get
 
03:45:26.229 --> 03:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
$443 so in that case it's 680 isn't that
 
03:45:29.710 --> 03:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
a $180 profit for the um so I can't
 
03:45:31.389 --> 03:45:31.399 align:start position:0%
speak to the document that you have in
 
03:45:33.670 --> 03:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
front of you um I think that Miss milin
 
03:45:36.790 --> 03:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
would be able to speak to that but um if
 
03:45:39.550 --> 03:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
I understand the the question or um the
 
03:45:42.070 --> 03:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
statement um
 
03:45:45.030 --> 03:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
that that reimbursement is for a free
 
03:45:48.149 --> 03:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
meal so um the school would not be
 
03:45:51.149 --> 03:45:51.159 align:start position:0%
charging the student for um for that
 
03:45:52.229 --> 03:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
price and they would get that
 
03:45:55.830 --> 03:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement only for um the free meal
 
03:45:57.309 --> 03:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
and they get it at a higher rate than
 
03:45:59.590 --> 03:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
their than their full price that's
 
03:46:01.550 --> 03:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
correct and there's um a different
 
03:46:04.309 --> 03:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for um the full price meal
 
03:46:07.670 --> 03:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
if they were to um to charge that to a a
 
03:46:09.910 --> 03:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
student Oh you mean the reduce price whe
 
03:46:12.510 --> 03:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
um so there's there yep free reduced and
 
03:46:14.070 --> 03:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
paid so there's different reimbursement
 
03:46:15.990 --> 03:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
rates depending upon what meal was
 
03:46:18.590 --> 03:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
served right right thank
 
03:46:21.469 --> 03:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
you while you're in front of us we have
 
03:46:23.910 --> 03:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
another bill here it's also dealing with
 
03:46:26.830 --> 03:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:30.189 --> 03:46:30.199 align:start position:0%
application when I talked with my
 
03:46:32.189 --> 03:46:32.199 align:start position:0%
district they're saying they already
 
03:46:35.149 --> 03:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
have an online application in
 
03:46:37.750 --> 03:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
place uh is this occurring elsewhere
 
03:46:40.830 --> 03:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
within the state um thank you for the
 
03:46:40.840 --> 03:46:41.990 align:start position:0%
within the state um thank you for the
question

03:46:41.990 --> 03:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:46:45.269 --> 03:46:45.279 align:start position:0%
so um previously during the the first
 
03:46:47.870 --> 03:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
hearing for this we did um testify that
 
03:46:49.910 --> 03:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have that that data at the
 
03:46:53.389 --> 03:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
department there are um school districts
 
03:46:55.269 --> 03:46:55.279 align:start position:0%
and schools that do have online
 
03:46:58.990 --> 03:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
applications already in in place um but
 
03:47:00.990 --> 03:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
we don't currently have the data on
 
03:47:05.030 --> 03:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
exactly which ones um do we did put out
 
03:47:10.550 --> 03:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
a voluntary survey um after um also um
 
03:47:12.830 --> 03:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
speaking to the meal debt um we
 
03:47:15.429 --> 03:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
proactively put the application um
 
03:47:17.110 --> 03:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
question in there along with the the
 
03:47:21.670 --> 03:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
meal debt survey as well too um and they
 
03:47:23.870 --> 03:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
um they meaning the the districts have
 
03:47:26.670 --> 03:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
until the 14th to reply to that um and
 
03:47:28.309 --> 03:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
once that was done I was going to
 
03:47:30.389 --> 03:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
provide that to to you so you have that
 
03:47:33.910 --> 03:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
information um just to currently right
 
03:47:36.110 --> 03:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
now um again remember that it is
 
03:47:38.870 --> 03:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
voluntary um and right now we have about
 
03:47:42.510 --> 03:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
44 responses um to to the um to the
 
03:47:47.469 --> 03:47:47.479 align:start position:0%
survey so um that's a good data to start
 
03:47:50.750 --> 03:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
with um but obviously we um you know
 
03:47:52.870 --> 03:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
we're relying upon um the voluntary
 
03:47:58.910 --> 03:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
nature of that so 44 out of how many um
 
03:48:03.229 --> 03:48:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:06.710 --> 03:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
thereabouts representa papait very
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
briefly um having being a uh Finance
 
03:48:12.950 --> 03:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
director I remember that I wasn't
 
03:48:15.149 --> 03:48:15.159 align:start position:0%
exactly that Keen on feeling survey is
 
03:48:17.710 --> 03:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
way before the deadline so I wouldn't
 
03:48:20.149 --> 03:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
trade too much into the 44 just a quick
 
03:48:23.630 --> 03:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
question if I may um would you think
 
03:48:26.110 --> 03:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
that uh districts which are concerned
 
03:48:28.510 --> 03:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
about their school Mill debt you know
 
03:48:31.349 --> 03:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
the unpaid balance would be rather
 
03:48:33.229 --> 03:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
likely to jump on the opportunity to
 
03:48:35.590 --> 03:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
fill the survey and tell you all about
 
03:48:39.229 --> 03:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
it um I I don't want to speak for the
 
03:48:42.189 --> 03:48:42.199 align:start position:0%
the districts filling out the survey um
 
03:48:45.229 --> 03:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
but we did mention that it was
 
03:48:48.990 --> 03:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
voluntary um and um you know we we did
 
03:48:50.790 --> 03:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
get some questions on Where where would
 
03:48:54.710 --> 03:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
this data be um you know be posted or or
 
03:48:59.710 --> 03:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
um and so um that could potentially um
 
03:49:03.110 --> 03:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know hinder some from um filling out
 
03:49:05.349 --> 03:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
the survey again um we made it very
 
03:49:09.309 --> 03:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
clear that it was voluntary um so if I
 
03:49:11.309 --> 03:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
make quick followup
 
03:49:15.189 --> 03:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
yes I'm not sure that I understand why a
 
03:49:18.550 --> 03:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
school district would be concerned about
 
03:49:21.229 --> 03:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
sharing their you know balance of you
 
03:49:23.550 --> 03:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
know school debt because that's part of
 
03:49:25.950 --> 03:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
their financial statements anyway right
 
03:49:27.750 --> 03:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
is there any privacy what what were the
 
03:49:29.670 --> 03:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
concerns that they may have expressed to
 
03:49:31.309 --> 03:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
lead you to think they may be unwilling
 
03:49:34.790 --> 03:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
to submit it um the the question was
 
03:49:34.800 --> 03:49:36.269 align:start position:0%
to submit it um the the question was
just

03:49:36.269 --> 03:49:36.279 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:49:40.550 --> 03:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
um where would this data be um what is
 
03:49:44.149 --> 03:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
the um request for for the the survey
 
03:49:48.110 --> 03:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:51.189 --> 03:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank
 
03:49:55.630 --> 03:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
you would it be correct that if Medicaid
 
03:49:58.229 --> 03:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
direct certification for f&amp;r meals was
 
03:50:00.790 --> 03:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
in place there would be less
 
03:50:04.389 --> 03:50:04.399 align:start position:0%
administrative costs to districts than
 
03:50:09.309 --> 03:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
the method currently in place for f&amp;r
 
03:50:11.269 --> 03:50:11.279 align:start position:0%
applications um thank you for the
 
03:50:14.510 --> 03:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
question the Medicaid direct currently
 
03:50:17.429 --> 03:50:17.439 align:start position:0%
um um in New Hampshire does not qualify
 
03:50:21.429 --> 03:50:21.439 align:start position:0%
students for meals um so it would open
 
03:50:24.110 --> 03:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
up a different um subset of students
 
03:50:28.630 --> 03:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
that would qualify um and the capability
 
03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
of them to be qualified in what we call
 
03:50:32.670 --> 03:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
the direct certification process would
 
03:50:36.229 --> 03:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
eliminate the need for um the additional
 
03:50:39.149 --> 03:50:39.159 align:start position:0%
application to be filled out so it would
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
be more efficient and also reduce the
 
03:50:45.630 --> 03:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
errors in applications yes
 
03:50:47.950 --> 03:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
um there's a potential for that to to
 
03:50:50.870 --> 03:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
reduce that um burden on filling out an
 
03:50:53.590 --> 03:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
additional piece of of um application
 
03:50:56.510 --> 03:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
for a family to
 
03:50:58.550 --> 03:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
qualify I have another question but it's
 
03:51:02.030 --> 03:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
not related to that go ahead thank you
 
03:51:05.070 --> 03:51:05.080 align:start position:0%
could you inform the committee about the
 
03:51:06.990 --> 03:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
community eligibility provision for
 
03:51:10.070 --> 03:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
School meals and what the impact of
 
03:51:12.110 --> 03:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification might be
 
03:51:14.710 --> 03:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
on that program
 
03:51:18.590 --> 03:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
sure um so the community eligibility
 
03:51:22.830 --> 03:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
program or also known as c um does use
 
03:51:25.309 --> 03:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
your directly certified um The
 
03:51:28.870 --> 03:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
District's directly certified data um to
 
03:51:30.990 --> 03:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
qualify for that percentage right now
 
03:51:32.990 --> 03:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
currently they use the data that's in
 
03:51:36.469 --> 03:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
place snap tan if migrant homeless um
 
03:51:39.149 --> 03:51:39.159 align:start position:0%
and this would also um if Medicaid
 
03:51:41.710 --> 03:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
direct were to be able to be added into
 
03:51:45.030 --> 03:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
that um could potentially increase the
 
03:51:48.630 --> 03:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
um percentage that does qualify for that
 
03:51:49.950 --> 03:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:51:53.550 --> 03:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
other side of the um the community
 
03:51:57.269 --> 03:51:57.279 align:start position:0%
eligibility program is that um meals
 
03:51:59.830 --> 03:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
would be provided at no cost to the
 
03:52:04.710 --> 03:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
student however um the other portion of
 
03:52:07.750 --> 03:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
let's just say a district has
 
03:52:11.950 --> 03:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
25% or let's say 40% um then 60% would
 
03:52:14.189 --> 03:52:14.199 align:start position:0%
need to be covered by the local level or
 
03:52:17.030 --> 03:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
non federal funds um so that's important
 
03:52:20.110 --> 03:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
information to to have as well to um to
 
03:52:23.910 --> 03:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
operate that program so even though um
 
03:52:27.990 --> 03:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
the ISP um or your directly certified
 
03:52:31.590 --> 03:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
numbers um maybe were you know lower and
 
03:52:34.070 --> 03:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
that does qualify you um the local level
 
03:52:36.950 --> 03:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
does need to come up with a difference
 
03:52:39.590 --> 03:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
for what is not paid for at the federal
 
03:52:43.229 --> 03:52:43.239 align:start position:0%
level if they were in the C correct if
 
03:52:44.510 --> 03:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
they were to operate the community
 
03:52:44.520 --> 03:52:46.269 align:start position:0%
they were to operate the community
eligibility

03:52:46.269 --> 03:52:46.279 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
03:52:49.910 --> 03:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
program further information needed repon
 
03:52:53.910 --> 03:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
luno yeah thanks um was did the
 
03:52:58.030 --> 03:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
committee receive the um the I I guess
 
03:52:59.269 --> 03:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
it I don't know if you call it the
 
03:53:02.030 --> 03:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
Census Data but basically the comparison
 
03:53:05.670 --> 03:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
by town of of the number of students in
 
03:53:08.309 --> 03:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
the 2026 free and reduced price
 
03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
lunch admr compared to the by town the
 
03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
number of students that are that
 
03:53:16.830 --> 03:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
students that are Medicaid enrolled and
 
03:53:18.870 --> 03:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
would would qualify under Medicaid
 
03:53:21.110 --> 03:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
direct um
 
03:53:23.870 --> 03:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
certification so so back I think a
 
03:53:26.870 --> 03:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago Mark when when when
 
03:53:29.469 --> 03:53:29.479 align:start position:0%
we were when um representative lad and I
 
03:53:31.670 --> 03:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
were were working with you and
 
03:53:34.070 --> 03:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative umberger there was a
 
03:53:36.910 --> 03:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
comparison spreadsheet that that you did
 
03:53:40.070 --> 03:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
and I just pulled it up and and I just
 
03:53:42.950 --> 03:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
picking on on a couple of a couple of
 
03:53:47.469 --> 03:53:47.479 align:start position:0%
towns like let's pick on Al cuz middle
 
03:53:50.830 --> 03:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
um so the the the the the
 
03:53:55.710 --> 03:53:55.720 align:start position:0%
2026 fnr count estimate is 202 whereas
 
03:53:57.550 --> 03:53:57.560 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid direct certification would
 
03:53:57.560 --> 03:53:58.469 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid direct certification would
be

03:53:58.469 --> 03:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:54:01.229 --> 03:54:01.239 align:start position:0%
244 and this is from the spreed you did
 
03:54:03.830 --> 03:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
in Hopkinson the
 
03:54:03.840 --> 03:54:05.990 align:start position:0%
in Hopkinson the
2026

03:54:05.990 --> 03:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
2026
 
03:54:11.469 --> 03:54:11.479 align:start position:0%
um frpl um is 78 Medicaid direct it's
 
03:54:15.110 --> 03:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
118 in hener so I'm just picking on hes
 
03:54:18.670 --> 03:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
here it goes from 99 to
 
03:54:24.309 --> 03:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
153 and um and so just wondering if if
 
03:54:27.149 --> 03:54:27.159 align:start position:0%
if the members of this committee would
 
03:54:30.269 --> 03:54:30.279 align:start position:0%
like to see what what these how the
 
03:54:32.630 --> 03:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
enrollment compare oh the Medicaid
 
03:54:34.870 --> 03:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
direct certification would compare to
 
03:54:37.110 --> 03:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
current free and reduced price lunch
 
03:54:39.309 --> 03:54:39.319 align:start position:0%
enrollment so we could see so we could
 
03:54:43.389 --> 03:54:43.399 align:start position:0%
each see what it means to our you know
 
03:54:46.189 --> 03:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
constituents but also but also Statewide
 
03:54:47.630 --> 03:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
and you know it's important to look at
 
03:54:52.229 --> 03:54:52.239 align:start position:0%
places like Manchester and Nashua um too
 
03:54:52.239 --> 03:54:54.189 align:start position:0%
places like Manchester and Nashua um too
and

03:54:54.189 --> 03:54:54.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:54:58.670 --> 03:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
um Manchester goes from
 
03:55:01.309 --> 03:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
5,857 in the in the
 
03:55:05.269 --> 03:55:05.279 align:start position:0%
2026 free introduce price lunch to
 
03:55:08.030 --> 03:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
6,974 in the um Medicaid direct I would
 
03:55:09.710 --> 03:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
be comfortable of sharing that data so
 
03:55:13.790 --> 03:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
essentially um uh dhj does um when they
 
03:55:15.189 --> 03:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
gave us the data for us to do the
 
03:55:17.389 --> 03:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
analysis to basically identify those 10
 
03:55:19.429 --> 03:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
approximate 10,000 students they did
 
03:55:21.790 --> 03:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
have it at the Town level um for
 
03:55:23.229 --> 03:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
whatever reason Penacook is always kind
 
03:55:24.830 --> 03:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
of unique they didn't have Penacook so
 
03:55:26.670 --> 03:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
an assumption was made about you know
 
03:55:28.070 --> 03:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
percentage of students that could be
 
03:55:30.590 --> 03:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
Penacook out of conquered so um some
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
assumptions were made in that data set
 
03:55:34.070 --> 03:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
um but essentially dhjs did provide us
 
03:55:36.110 --> 03:55:36.120 align:start position:0%
that data set um and we have a
 
03:55:38.269 --> 03:55:38.279 align:start position:0%
comparison to current law to what
 
03:55:40.870 --> 03:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct might might be and it's
 
03:55:43.550 --> 03:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
it estimates um U you know approximately
 
03:55:45.070 --> 03:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
10,000 students
 
03:55:46.670 --> 03:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
um there are some peculiarities with the
 
03:55:48.269 --> 03:55:48.279 align:start position:0%
data in a sense that sometimes when we
 
03:55:51.710 --> 03:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
looked at what DHHS had for Medicaid
 
03:55:55.550 --> 03:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
students uh children uh ages 5 through
 
03:55:58.830 --> 03:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
18 um um sometimes the medic number was
 
03:56:01.030 --> 03:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
lower than what the fnr number was so
 
03:56:02.389 --> 03:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
that was interesting that was just
 
03:56:04.670 --> 03:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
students not on Medicaid but on fnr Snap
 
03:56:06.670 --> 03:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
or tanif so that did happen in a few
 
03:56:08.950 --> 03:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
instances that was less common it's more
 
03:56:10.750 --> 03:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
common that you the Medicaid number has
 
03:56:13.670 --> 03:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
the larger data set um but we can
 
03:56:15.910 --> 03:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
provide that data yeah so Mark when we
 
03:56:19.030 --> 03:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
looked at that data years ago we saw
 
03:56:21.429 --> 03:56:21.439 align:start position:0%
that following 8th
 
03:56:24.830 --> 03:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
grade there is a drop and Kelly I think
 
03:56:26.630 --> 03:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
you may have seen this before too A Drop
 
03:56:29.149 --> 03:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
in participants in the f&amp;r
 
03:56:32.830 --> 03:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
program uh due to high school students
 
03:56:35.670 --> 03:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
either not wanting to you know identify
 
03:56:38.790 --> 03:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
as fnr or or going with their buddies
 
03:56:40.110 --> 03:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere and having a meal somewhere
 
03:56:44.590 --> 03:56:44.600 align:start position:0%
else it's more to their liking um are in
 
03:56:47.389 --> 03:56:47.399 align:start position:0%
projecting the figures right here are we
 
03:56:49.229 --> 03:56:49.239 align:start position:0%
taking in account that waterfall effect
 
03:56:51.229 --> 03:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
that we see from middle school into high
 
03:56:54.269 --> 03:56:54.279 align:start position:0%
school we just we took um the raw data
 
03:56:56.630 --> 03:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
that Medicaid provided to us by town and
 
03:56:59.309 --> 03:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
we we did no analysis no analysis by
 
03:57:01.349 --> 03:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
cohort level or anything just raw data
 
03:57:04.510 --> 03:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
by town and compared it
 
03:57:07.870 --> 03:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
okay did you but just a follow up on
 
03:57:11.349 --> 03:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
your question Rick I'm sorry to
 
03:57:15.229 --> 03:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
jump represent Mr chair I'm sorry um but
 
03:57:17.070 --> 03:57:17.080 align:start position:0%
but did did we did we see a
 
03:57:19.189 --> 03:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
corresponding drop off during during
 
03:57:23.429 --> 03:57:23.439 align:start position:0%
waivers did um uh yeah yes once when the
 
03:57:26.389 --> 03:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
USDA um when USDA did not require the
 
03:57:27.870 --> 03:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
form and you could access meals without
 
03:57:31.510 --> 03:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
a form um substantial drop off um no
 
03:57:33.110 --> 03:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's not what I meant
 
03:57:35.229 --> 03:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
did did did
 
03:57:37.790 --> 03:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
kids did did the did the did the number
 
03:57:41.030 --> 03:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
of meals go the other way consumed under
 
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
under waivers go up yeah yeah I mean
 
03:57:46.229 --> 03:57:46.239 align:start position:0%
they they were okay eating the meals
 
03:57:49.510 --> 03:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
and more participation yeah um yes there
 
03:57:52.149 --> 03:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
was an increase in participation um with
 
03:57:54.630 --> 03:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
the the waivers and not having um the
 
03:57:56.750 --> 03:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
forms to to fill out okay great that was
 
03:57:58.189 --> 03:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
at the high school
 
03:58:01.630 --> 03:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
level um the elementary I can see it yes
 
03:58:04.389 --> 03:58:04.399 align:start position:0%
I would say AC that was across the board
 
03:58:06.590 --> 03:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
um that there was an increase in meals
 
03:58:08.830 --> 03:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
when they were served at no
 
03:58:11.070 --> 03:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
cost gon
 
03:58:14.590 --> 03:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
Damon could either of you clarify come
 
03:58:17.710 --> 03:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
up earlier thank you could either of you
 
03:58:19.229 --> 03:58:19.239 align:start position:0%
clarify this came up earlier this
 
03:58:22.269 --> 03:58:22.279 align:start position:0%
afternoon and um Mark you just mentioned
 
03:58:26.910 --> 03:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
18 so does the fnr program end at 18
 
03:58:30.670 --> 03:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
years old or does it go for kids who are
 
03:58:33.429 --> 03:58:33.439 align:start position:0%
still in school up to
 
03:58:36.349 --> 03:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
22 yeah I I don't recall if the data set
 
03:58:38.070 --> 03:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
we used is through 18 the data set we
 
03:58:39.229 --> 03:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
used to do the analysis might have been
 
03:58:41.269 --> 03:58:41.279 align:start position:0%
through 18 but if you're in school and
 
03:58:44.349 --> 03:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
you're 21 um I'm not aware of any restri
 
03:58:45.670 --> 03:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
that would we would count you You' be
 
03:58:48.710 --> 03:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
part of adequacy um so I don't think
 
03:58:49.750 --> 03:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
there's any limitation there like to
 
03:58:52.590 --> 03:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
clarify that thank you okay we do have
 
03:58:55.389 --> 03:58:55.399 align:start position:0%
several other bills uh you don't have to
 
03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
get up yet um dealing with uh meals we
 
03:59:01.630 --> 03:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
have one relative the eligibility for
 
03:59:03.670 --> 03:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
free School meals that's increasing the
 
03:59:07.070 --> 03:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
eligibility level and the other one 703
 
03:59:08.630 --> 03:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
relative prohibiting school districts
 
03:59:10.830 --> 03:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
from denying meals to students with
 
03:59:12.950 --> 03:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
unpaid meal balances and this is the one
 
03:59:14.670 --> 03:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
I want to talk about
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
you did you're doing a survey on that
 
03:59:18.630 --> 03:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
you don't have that information back on
 
03:59:20.990 --> 03:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
what these balances are at the end of
 
03:59:24.870 --> 03:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
the year and how much total we are bless
 
03:59:27.269 --> 03:59:27.279 align:start position:0%
in the state because of that I do have
 
03:59:30.030 --> 03:59:30.040 align:start position:0%
um preliminary data that I could provide
 
03:59:33.550 --> 03:59:33.560 align:start position:0%
um digitally to to the committee um but
 
03:59:36.790 --> 03:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
we gave until the 14th to submit that
 
03:59:39.990 --> 03:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
full data set
 
03:59:43.429 --> 03:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
okay okay is there any other information
 
03:59:45.750 --> 03:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
here we want to get from doe it's time
 
03:59:47.469 --> 03:59:47.479 align:start position:0%
for us maybe to have a little discussion
 
03:59:51.590 --> 03:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves here as to you
 
03:59:54.389 --> 03:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
know where we're going with these
 
03:59:56.429 --> 03:59:56.439 align:start position:0%
bills thank you very
 
03:59:56.439 --> 04:00:00.429 align:start position:0%
bills thank you very
much

04:00:00.429 --> 04:00:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:03.910 --> 04:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
um I I think I I'm hearing the big issue
 
04:00:06.670 --> 04:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
is the additional
 
04:00:11.710 --> 04:00:11.720 align:start position:0%
cost am I wrong on that $50
 
04:00:14.590 --> 04:00:14.600 align:start position:0%
million for what for what for which
 
04:00:17.630 --> 04:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
which one Medicaid direct well we've got
 
04:00:19.710 --> 04:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
an amendment that takes that addresses
 
04:00:22.309 --> 04:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
that the 50 mon for the first several
 
04:00:25.030 --> 04:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
years yeah for the first in this budget
 
04:00:26.830 --> 04:00:26.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah but but also we've got
 
04:00:29.790 --> 04:00:29.800 align:start position:0%
school funding to I mean there's a lot
 
04:00:30.990 --> 04:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that I think are
 
04:00:35.189 --> 04:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
going to overtake I know I know
 
04:00:38.590 --> 04:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
it is there any other discussion on
 
04:00:40.910 --> 04:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
this Mr chair do you mean on the
 
04:00:42.830 --> 04:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director or on all on all of
 
04:00:45.710 --> 04:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
them um so if I could I'd like to bring
 
04:00:48.349 --> 04:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
up the amendment to
 
04:00:52.590 --> 04:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
703 yeah you have one I circulated it
 
04:00:56.830 --> 04:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
you should have it um so there is sorry
 
04:00:59.950 --> 04:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:04.710 --> 04:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
copy thank you um for 703 yeah which is
 
04:01:06.830 --> 04:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
the one in regards to prohibiting
 
04:01:09.510 --> 04:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
districts from shaming students who have
 
04:01:14.550 --> 04:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
meal debt um amendment number 034 43
 
04:01:17.269 --> 04:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
which you should have in front of you
 
04:01:19.750 --> 04:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
removes the part of the bill that would
 
04:01:23.630 --> 04:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
have required doe to pay off school
 
04:01:26.870 --> 04:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
district's meal debt so it leaves the
 
04:01:28.189 --> 04:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
exact same
 
04:01:32.110 --> 04:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
language of the first part of the bill
 
04:01:35.110 --> 04:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
detailing the specifics of not shaming
 
04:01:38.389 --> 04:01:38.399 align:start position:0%
students in regard to their debt um and
 
04:01:38.399 --> 04:01:39.710 align:start position:0%
students in regard to their debt um and
leaving

04:01:39.710 --> 04:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
leaving
 
04:01:43.950 --> 04:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
in uh let me see what number it is here
 
04:01:46.309 --> 04:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
page two line five requiring school
 
04:01:48.630 --> 04:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
districts to accept voluntary donations
 
04:01:50.469 --> 04:01:50.479 align:start position:0%
to alleviate School Meal debt because
 
04:01:52.110 --> 04:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
there were issues with that in the last
 
04:01:52.120 --> 04:01:52.990 align:start position:0%
there were issues with that in the last
school

04:01:52.990 --> 04:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:01:58.349 --> 04:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
year um so if the amendment is approved
 
04:02:00.710 --> 04:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
there is no cost to this bill it is
 
04:02:03.790 --> 04:02:03.800 align:start position:0%
simply a policy statement to districts
 
04:02:05.630 --> 04:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
about kindness and respect to students
 
04:02:07.429 --> 04:02:07.439 align:start position:0%
who are not responsible for their status
 
04:02:07.439 --> 04:02:12.189 align:start position:0%
who are not responsible for their status
in

04:02:12.189 --> 04:02:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:14.910 --> 04:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
poverty yes
 
04:02:14.920 --> 04:02:15.990 align:start position:0%
poverty yes
thank

04:02:15.990 --> 04:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:02:18.550 --> 04:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
you can you share with me how are school
 
04:02:20.670 --> 04:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
districts shaming these kids I mean what
 
04:02:23.389 --> 04:02:23.399 align:start position:0%
what's happening out there thank you for
 
04:02:27.149 --> 04:02:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:29.990 --> 04:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
question there are a number of ways that
 
04:02:33.269 --> 04:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
a child would be identified as being a
 
04:02:36.149 --> 04:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
person in debt or with limited
 
04:02:38.550 --> 04:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
resources it could be that the school
 
04:02:40.469 --> 04:02:40.479 align:start position:0%
district gives them different food maybe
 
04:02:43.030 --> 04:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
a cold sandwich instead of the selection
 
04:02:44.990 --> 04:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
from a menu like what I
 
04:02:47.590 --> 04:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
circulated that is legal to do it's not
 
04:02:47.600 --> 04:02:48.429 align:start position:0%
circulated that is legal to do it's not
very

04:02:48.429 --> 04:02:48.439 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:02:51.910 --> 04:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
kind um and it makes kids not go get the
 
04:02:54.309 --> 04:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
meal because they're stigmatized by
 
04:02:55.790 --> 04:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
being that
 
04:03:00.269 --> 04:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
child um they could have to have a rband
 
04:03:02.349 --> 04:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
or some other
 
04:03:05.550 --> 04:03:05.560 align:start position:0%
identifier um that Flags them as the
 
04:03:09.550 --> 04:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
person who has debt there have been a
 
04:03:12.510 --> 04:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
number of instances of a cashier saying
 
04:03:15.189 --> 04:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
to a child you don't have enough money
 
04:03:17.110 --> 04:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
on your account for that you can't have
 
04:03:20.510 --> 04:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
that and making them put food back which
 
04:03:22.030 --> 04:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
then that food actually can't be serve
 
04:03:24.070 --> 04:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
to anybody else either because it's been
 
04:03:26.229 --> 04:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
handled by a consumer so that's the
 
04:03:26.239 --> 04:03:27.229 align:start position:0%
handled by a consumer so that's the
ultimate

04:03:27.229 --> 04:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
ultimate
 
04:03:27.239 --> 04:03:29.469 align:start position:0%
ultimate
waste

04:03:29.469 --> 04:03:29.479 align:start position:0%
waste
 
04:03:32.710 --> 04:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if there are currently
 
04:03:35.550 --> 04:03:35.560 align:start position:0%
any districts in New Hampshire that what
 
04:03:38.229 --> 04:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
I'm about to say has occurred but I know
 
04:03:38.239 --> 04:03:39.510 align:start position:0%
I'm about to say has occurred but I know
that

04:03:39.510 --> 04:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:03:42.790 --> 04:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
in history and in the National Data kids
 
04:03:44.870 --> 04:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
have been prohibitive from participating
 
04:03:47.429 --> 04:03:47.439 align:start position:0%
in field trips or activities there's
 
04:03:50.030 --> 04:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
just a whole list of ways that we shame
 
04:03:52.870 --> 04:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
the poor so this is just intended to be
 
04:03:56.030 --> 04:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
a statement to say we are not the state
 
04:03:59.070 --> 04:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
that does that we are a state that is
 
04:04:00.910 --> 04:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
kind and respectful to our
 
04:04:07.110 --> 04:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:07.120 --> 04:04:11.189 align:start position:0%
 
status

04:04:11.189 --> 04:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:16.189 --> 04:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:18.990 --> 04:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um in looking on the
 
04:04:21.389 --> 04:04:21.399 align:start position:0%
bill I appreciate the amendment to it
 
04:04:23.830 --> 04:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
because that was definitely a big
 
04:04:26.510 --> 04:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
concern the removed language I'm still
 
04:04:29.149 --> 04:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
looking at um
 
04:04:31.349 --> 04:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
FG and
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
H um and if you wouldn't mind maybe you
 
04:04:37.309 --> 04:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
know going through them my concern with
 
04:04:39.870 --> 04:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
f is
 
04:04:42.389 --> 04:04:42.399 align:start position:0%
that there is a huge difference between
 
04:04:44.189 --> 04:04:44.199 align:start position:0%
somebody who cannot pay for their School
 
04:04:46.070 --> 04:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
meals and somebody who won't pay for
 
04:04:50.309 --> 04:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
their School meals and if we tell the
 
04:04:52.950 --> 04:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
schools you just cannot collect at all
 
04:04:55.790 --> 04:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
for lunch why would any well that's how
 
04:04:58.030 --> 04:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
I read F I mean I would appreciate then
 
04:04:59.870 --> 04:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
an understanding of what am I miss
 
04:04:59.880 --> 04:05:02.110 align:start position:0%
an understanding of what am I miss
reading

04:05:02.110 --> 04:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
reading
 
04:05:05.990 --> 04:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
here yeah thank you for the
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
question so it's saying that the school
 
04:05:10.910 --> 04:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
district can't use a collections agency
 
04:05:13.030 --> 04:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
to collect unpaid School Mills debt it's
 
04:05:16.750 --> 04:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
not saying that the district can't make
 
04:05:19.870 --> 04:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
the responsible parties parents
 
04:05:22.269 --> 04:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
Guardians aware of the debt we're not
 
04:05:26.630 --> 04:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
asking them to not request payment we're
 
04:05:28.510 --> 04:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
not sending it to collection however
 
04:05:32.830 --> 04:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
that's F if I may yes and would it be
 
04:05:34.469 --> 04:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate to maybe go back and forth a
 
04:05:38.030 --> 04:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
little in this case thank you I I just
 
04:05:41.550 --> 04:05:41.560 align:start position:0%
want to be careful Mr chair so problem
 
04:05:43.910 --> 04:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
is I understand that I can send send the
 
04:05:45.990 --> 04:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
bill right but what is the school
 
04:05:47.750 --> 04:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
district supposed to do if they send the
 
04:05:50.950 --> 04:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
bill to the richest house in town and
 
04:05:54.149 --> 04:05:54.159 align:start position:0%
they just don't pay that isn't happening
 
04:05:57.389 --> 04:05:57.399 align:start position:0%
under this under this it may create
 
04:05:59.790 --> 04:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
basically if you are telling me that I
 
04:06:02.510 --> 04:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
can send you a bill but I cannot use a
 
04:06:04.429 --> 04:06:04.439 align:start position:0%
collection agency or any other legal
 
04:06:06.070 --> 04:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
means to collect a
 
04:06:08.670 --> 04:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
debt you are basically telling that
 
04:06:10.910 --> 04:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
person who may have paid before that hey
 
04:06:12.670 --> 04:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
there is no consequence to not paying
 
04:06:14.469 --> 04:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
for my launch just going to take the
 
04:06:15.990 --> 04:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
free ride because the school district
 
04:06:18.389 --> 04:06:18.399 align:start position:0%
will have to eat it I'm I'm looking at
 
04:06:20.030 --> 04:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
moral hazards right I'm not saying
 
04:06:22.229 --> 04:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
that's a current issue because under the
 
04:06:25.149 --> 04:06:25.159 align:start position:0%
current scenario we obviously have a way
 
04:06:28.070 --> 04:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
to collect and I agree with it at
 
04:06:29.790 --> 04:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes school in May but my my
 
04:06:31.349 --> 04:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
opinion crossed the line and became
 
04:06:34.429 --> 04:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
overly aggressive so I think there is
 
04:06:36.469 --> 04:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
something that we could look at that
 
04:06:38.469 --> 04:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
there but this seems to go all the way
 
04:06:41.950 --> 04:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
the other way to you cannot collect even
 
04:06:43.590 --> 04:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
from people who absolutely have the
 
04:06:46.110 --> 04:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
means I just don't feel like it again we
 
04:06:47.550 --> 04:06:47.560 align:start position:0%
don't have to have a definitive answer
 
04:06:48.910 --> 04:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
but I want you to understand what my
 
04:06:51.070 --> 04:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
concerns are and see if you have any
 
04:06:53.590 --> 04:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts on
 
04:06:59.750 --> 04:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:02.349 --> 04:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
concerns I would just respond to that
 
04:07:07.189 --> 04:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
part and then move on to three
 
04:07:09.550 --> 04:07:09.560 align:start position:0%
um I think people can come from
 
04:07:11.469 --> 04:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
different perspectives
 
04:07:14.870 --> 04:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
on what our responsibil ility is to poor
 
04:07:16.550 --> 04:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
people and I
 
04:07:19.630 --> 04:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
would substantially weigh the
 
04:07:21.590 --> 04:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
value of
 
04:07:24.349 --> 04:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
this to the poor students who would be
 
04:07:25.550 --> 04:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
shamed for
 
04:07:28.309 --> 04:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
debt and eliminating that
 
04:07:30.910 --> 04:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
shaming I think the value of that is far
 
04:07:33.670 --> 04:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
far greater than whatever minimal risk
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
there may be of the random
 
04:07:39.750 --> 04:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
rare take advantage
 
04:07:42.550 --> 04:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
person I mean frankly if you're that
 
04:07:44.510 --> 04:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
well to do
 
04:07:45.910 --> 04:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know the kids are probably going out
 
04:07:45.920 --> 04:07:46.670 align:start position:0%
you know the kids are probably going out
to

04:07:46.670 --> 04:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:07:49.830 --> 04:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
lunch um I just don't see that as a
 
04:07:53.590 --> 04:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
primary variable on the GS side um G is
 
04:07:55.510 --> 04:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
the require schools to develop an
 
04:07:58.590 --> 04:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
outreach program to ensure to encourage
 
04:08:00.189 --> 04:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
parents or Guardians to apply for the
 
04:08:02.870 --> 04:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
free Price my question was why a mandate
 
04:08:04.710 --> 04:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
it seems that the schools already have
 
04:08:08.469 --> 04:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
an incentive to do so and as far as I
 
04:08:10.990 --> 04:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
know they tend to be very good about
 
04:08:12.469 --> 04:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
reminding people and they're already
 
04:08:15.189 --> 04:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
doing everything they can my question is
 
04:08:18.830 --> 04:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
why why then do we need to codify a
 
04:08:21.590 --> 04:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
requirement here which can lead us down
 
04:08:24.990 --> 04:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
the path of unfunded mandates and all
 
04:08:28.830 --> 04:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
that I think the intent of that Clause
 
04:08:33.469 --> 04:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that we reach out to
 
04:08:36.990 --> 04:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
every child or every family who would
 
04:08:39.070 --> 04:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
benefit from free and reduced meals so
 
04:08:41.149 --> 04:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
that we are decreasing the incidence of
 
04:08:44.189 --> 04:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
childhood hunger but
 
04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
similarly H H is actually already in
 
04:08:50.189 --> 04:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
federal statute it's just including in
 
04:08:52.750 --> 04:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
our statute because it's so related to
 
04:08:56.630 --> 04:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
this that schools are allowed to
 
04:08:58.910 --> 04:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
facilitate completing the
 
04:09:02.670 --> 04:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
application following the federal
 
04:09:05.870 --> 04:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
code understood if I may come back to G
 
04:09:09.469 --> 04:09:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:12.189 --> 04:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
last are you aware of any schools that
 
04:09:14.149 --> 04:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
don't try hard enough so that we need to
 
04:09:16.429 --> 04:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
codify this into the law I don't need
 
04:09:18.830 --> 04:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
names for the schools but are you aware
 
04:09:21.469 --> 04:09:21.479 align:start position:0%
of schools that just don't do it even
 
04:09:23.070 --> 04:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
though the adequacy funding and
 
04:09:24.830 --> 04:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
everything depends on
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
it I don't have a Statewide survey of
 
04:09:28.990 --> 04:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
what all the schools are doing I know
 
04:09:30.790 --> 04:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
what schools in my district do so I
 
04:09:32.189 --> 04:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
don't think I'd be able to answer that
 
04:09:35.149 --> 04:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
broadly thank you okay are there yes
 
04:09:38.670 --> 04:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
represent cocom thank you Mr chair going
 
04:09:42.630 --> 04:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
back to f um you know I agree that there
 
04:09:45.149 --> 04:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
are kids out there and families out
 
04:09:46.990 --> 04:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
there that that are definitely poor and
 
04:09:48.510 --> 04:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
they're struggling and they need help
 
04:09:50.950 --> 04:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree with that and I don't
 
04:09:55.149 --> 04:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
think it's fair that the kids should be
 
04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
faced with these dilemmas at school when
 
04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
it comes to their parents who are making
 
04:10:01.630 --> 04:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
bad financial decisions that are putting
 
04:10:04.790 --> 04:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
them in this position um but when it
 
04:10:08.389 --> 04:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
goes to the collection agency I don't I
 
04:10:10.590 --> 04:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
struggle with that one because there are
 
04:10:12.590 --> 04:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
parents out there that do have the means
 
04:10:14.590 --> 04:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
but they're making decisions with their
 
04:10:17.990 --> 04:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
money that is may not be prioritizing
 
04:10:20.550 --> 04:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
their kids eating uh their their uh
 
04:10:23.269 --> 04:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
lunch program you know they've got cell
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
phones they've got cigarettes they've
 
04:10:26.710 --> 04:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
got fancy cars they've got all these
 
04:10:28.590 --> 04:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
other things but their kids still going
 
04:10:30.309 --> 04:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
to school hungry and that's not the
 
04:10:32.830 --> 04:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
kids's fault but I don't think we should
 
04:10:35.389 --> 04:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
be eliminating that responsibility from
 
04:10:37.070 --> 04:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
those parents who are making poor
 
04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
decisions and not prioritizing their
 
04:10:43.070 --> 04:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
kids meals ahead of time ahead of other
 
04:10:45.469 --> 04:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
things things so I really think we need
 
04:10:48.429 --> 04:10:48.439 align:start position:0%
to be keeping that in
 
04:10:52.429 --> 04:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
there yes thank you Mr chairman I I
 
04:10:54.510 --> 04:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate the compassion and and
 
04:10:55.710 --> 04:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
everything that you're saying I want to
 
04:10:58.030 --> 04:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
put you into my classroom for just a
 
04:11:00.870 --> 04:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
couple of seconds on the period before
 
04:11:02.670 --> 04:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
lunch and the child came into my
 
04:11:04.950 --> 04:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
classroom and ate his lunch and then he
 
04:11:06.469 --> 04:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
goes to the lunchroom and he fills up
 
04:11:09.870 --> 04:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
his tray and this prohibits the
 
04:11:13.389 --> 04:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
lunchroom from any recourse to stopping
 
04:11:15.790 --> 04:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
him from taking a second
 
04:11:18.429 --> 04:11:18.439 align:start position:0%
lunch if if they're prohibited from
 
04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
denying a meal and prohibited from
 
04:11:22.349 --> 04:11:22.359 align:start position:0%
disposing or taking away and they're
 
04:11:24.149 --> 04:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
prohibited from identifying or
 
04:11:26.510 --> 04:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
stigmatizing and they go down the
 
04:11:31.830 --> 04:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:35.950 --> 04:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
theft let me clarify if I may the
 
04:11:37.870 --> 04:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
circumstance you're
 
04:11:40.269 --> 04:11:40.279 align:start position:0%
describing so your
 
04:11:43.469 --> 04:11:43.479 align:start position:0%
student had a lunch available to them he
 
04:11:45.189 --> 04:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
brings his lunch into the classroom
 
04:11:46.429 --> 04:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
brought lunch with him is that what
 
04:11:54.790 --> 04:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:54.800 --> 04:11:57.109 align:start position:0%
 
us

04:11:57.109 --> 04:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:12:00.790 --> 04:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
I what I want to say is presumably that
 
04:12:03.229 --> 04:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
child was hungry enough to need both
 
04:12:05.269 --> 04:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
lunches like maybe they didn't have
 
04:12:07.229 --> 04:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
breakfast maybe they don't have
 
04:12:10.149 --> 04:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
dinner and how common is that I mean
 
04:12:10.159 --> 04:12:11.349 align:start position:0%
dinner and how common is that I mean
honestly

04:12:11.349 --> 04:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
honestly
 
04:12:14.229 --> 04:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
people I don't have a further
 
04:12:19.189 --> 04:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
respon okay I yes representative
 
04:12:23.429 --> 04:12:23.439 align:start position:0%
Brown so a related bill here is
 
04:12:26.910 --> 04:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
665 which raises
 
04:12:30.910 --> 04:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
the minimum to 300% of the federal
 
04:12:34.309 --> 04:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
poverty guidelines for eligibility for
 
04:12:35.990 --> 04:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
free School
 
04:12:36.000 --> 04:12:38.790 align:start position:0%
free School
meals

04:12:38.790 --> 04:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
meals
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
um and that's in this the same batch of
 
04:12:41.760 --> 04:12:43.750 align:start position:0%
um and that's in this the same batch of
bills

04:12:43.750 --> 04:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:12:45.510 --> 04:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just concerned because the fiscal
 
04:12:48.950 --> 04:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
note states that this has a this has a
 
04:12:52.070 --> 04:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
significant fiscal impact potentially
 
04:12:55.309 --> 04:12:55.319 align:start position:0%
since 300% of the federal poverty rate
 
04:12:58.070 --> 04:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
includes 50% of the student
 
04:13:01.630 --> 04:13:01.640 align:start position:0%
population and could increase a cost to
 
04:13:05.590 --> 04:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
the state of $48 million per year so I'm
 
04:13:08.950 --> 04:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
wondering while 300% or lower of the
 
04:13:13.750 --> 04:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
poverty rate group is benef benefited
 
04:13:16.149 --> 04:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
what happens to the
 
04:13:19.710 --> 04:13:19.720 align:start position:0%
31% and to
 
04:13:23.070 --> 04:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
375% um of the federal poverty rate
 
04:13:24.990 --> 04:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
families they'll
 
04:13:27.910 --> 04:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
be ask asking to be uh burdened with
 
04:13:29.630 --> 04:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
additional taxes
 
04:13:33.189 --> 04:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
so and you see what I'm saying here um
 
04:13:33.199 --> 04:13:34.070 align:start position:0%
so and you see what I'm saying here um
I'm

04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
04:13:41.389 --> 04:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:48.830 --> 04:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:51.630 --> 04:13:51.640 align:start position:0%
665 because many families are struggling
 
04:13:52.790 --> 04:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
even at
 
04:13:56.269 --> 04:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
350% of the federal poverty
 
04:14:00.030 --> 04:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
rate yeah yeah no sure sure I'll take it
 
04:14:02.389 --> 04:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
so so this is a lot of the same argument
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
we hear on vouchers too and that that
 
04:14:06.750 --> 04:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
you need to you got to there there's
 
04:14:10.630 --> 04:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
somebody that's at 351 per of poverty so
 
04:14:13.269 --> 04:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
we've got to increase vouchers to 400%
 
04:14:15.189 --> 04:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
got to increase it to 500% there's
 
04:14:18.750 --> 04:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
somebody that makes um
 
04:14:22.910 --> 04:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
$179,000 a year which is $100 more than
 
04:14:25.309 --> 04:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
the 500% cut off so we need to increase
 
04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
it to unlimited so that somebody making
 
04:14:28.399 --> 04:14:29.149 align:start position:0%
it to unlimited so that somebody making
um

04:14:29.149 --> 04:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:32.229 --> 04:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
$500,000 a year can get a free voucher
 
04:14:34.349 --> 04:14:34.359 align:start position:0%
from State of New Hampshire taxpayers
 
04:14:35.990 --> 04:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is feeding
 
04:14:36.000 --> 04:14:37.109 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is feeding
hungry

04:14:37.109 --> 04:14:37.119 align:start position:0%
hungry
 
04:14:39.670 --> 04:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
kids and right now we feed hungry kids
 
04:14:42.189 --> 04:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
for free who fill out the paperwork up
 
04:14:46.469 --> 04:14:46.479 align:start position:0%
to13 % of the poverty line 131 you fall
 
04:14:50.469 --> 04:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
into the reduced plan 185 you're still
 
04:14:52.590 --> 04:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
in reduced my my understanding there's
 
04:14:54.389 --> 04:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
not a whole bunch that fall into the
 
04:14:57.229 --> 04:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
reduced most of it is in the is in the
 
04:15:01.149 --> 04:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
is in the full um free category so I
 
04:15:03.590 --> 04:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't know what happens when you get to
 
04:15:08.070 --> 04:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
186% or 300% or 30% but we're not asking
 
04:15:11.229 --> 04:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to Pony up a $7,000 freaking
 
04:15:13.710 --> 04:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
School voucher to pay for School tuition
 
04:15:15.229 --> 04:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking about feeding hungry kids
 
04:15:17.990 --> 04:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
here so shame on just the question Mr
 
04:15:20.510 --> 04:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
chair point of order yeah I'm done could
 
04:15:22.229 --> 04:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
we keep the language under control I
 
04:15:25.790 --> 04:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
mean be careful FWS are I didn't drop
 
04:15:29.070 --> 04:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
okay I yeah we yeah we won't do that
 
04:15:33.790 --> 04:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
anymore um okay so we have it's at 2:15
 
04:15:38.389 --> 04:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
right now and uh we're at the end of the
 
04:15:41.469 --> 04:15:41.479 align:start position:0%
time for the first discussion on on
 
04:15:44.870 --> 04:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
meals and now we're going to jump into
 
04:15:46.469 --> 04:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
and we're going to take a f minute break
 
04:15:48.349 --> 04:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
here for everybody take a break and walk
 
04:15:49.630 --> 04:15:49.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit then we're going to come
 
04:15:51.950 --> 04:15:51.960 align:start position:0%

Bureau School Finance so this in
 
04:30:05.469 --> 04:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
particular is looking at um five
 
04:30:08.710 --> 04:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
district for FY 24 the revenue versus
 
04:30:10.870 --> 04:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
expenditures and revenue being three
 
04:30:12.670 --> 04:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
categories that we have there those are
 
04:30:14.950 --> 04:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
those first three columns after District
 
04:30:16.950 --> 04:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
name so that would be sped Aid Revenue
 
04:30:19.389 --> 04:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
state aid that's a special education Aid
 
04:30:21.790 --> 04:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid next column would be
 
04:30:24.070 --> 04:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
differential Aid that would be uh the
 
04:30:25.910 --> 04:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
aid through the adequacy formula that
 
04:30:29.990 --> 04:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
would be specifically for um
 
04:30:32.870 --> 04:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
the you went a little quickly I'm sorry
 
04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
Brian slow down it's the end of the
 
04:30:41.229 --> 04:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
day sure so um it would be 1 2 3 4 5 the
 
04:30:43.790 --> 04:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
fifth column is differential Aid Revenue
 
04:30:43.800 --> 04:30:46.510 align:start position:0%
fifth column is differential Aid Revenue
parenthesis

04:30:46.510 --> 04:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
parenthesis
 
04:30:50.189 --> 04:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
State sped Aid Revenue differential Aid
 
04:30:55.590 --> 04:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
correct idea correct and sped total sped
 
04:30:57.229 --> 04:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
correct so those Revenue columns would
 
04:30:59.229 --> 04:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
be the revenue for each district so
 
04:31:00.950 --> 04:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
special education Aid and then
 
04:31:03.750 --> 04:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
specifically special education um
 
04:31:06.269 --> 04:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid and then idea through the
 
04:31:08.030 --> 04:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
federal government so it's a mix of
 
04:31:09.750 --> 04:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
state revenue for specifically for
 
04:31:12.149 --> 04:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
special education and then Federal um
 
04:31:14.349 --> 04:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue specifically for Education uh
 
04:31:16.790 --> 04:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
special education and then that last
 
04:31:19.070 --> 04:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
total sped expenditures that's what's
 
04:31:22.309 --> 04:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
reported through the doe 25s annually um
 
04:31:25.109 --> 04:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
as reported by the districts to the
 
04:31:27.469 --> 04:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
department so then uh the following
 
04:31:29.550 --> 04:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
columns would be the percent that is
 
04:31:31.229 --> 04:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
covering those expenditures so the first
 
04:31:33.550 --> 04:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
one being percent State covering
 
04:31:36.030 --> 04:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
expenditures so that's that's basically
 
04:31:37.550 --> 04:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
the expenditures for each district
 
04:31:42.870 --> 04:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
divided by the state um Revenue so and
 
04:31:44.429 --> 04:31:44.439 align:start position:0%
then that would be the two columns sped
 
04:31:46.870 --> 04:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
Aid Revenue special education Aid and
 
04:31:48.429 --> 04:31:48.439 align:start position:0%
differential Aid
 
04:31:50.590 --> 04:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
revenue and then the same goes for the
 
04:31:51.950 --> 04:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
federal government that would be the
 
04:31:54.309 --> 04:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
total special education expenditures
 
04:31:57.469 --> 04:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
divided by just the federal revenue and
 
04:31:59.910 --> 04:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
then uh another column being state and
 
04:32:02.469 --> 04:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
federal revenue covering expenditures so
 
04:32:04.269 --> 04:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
that would be Aid coming into the
 
04:32:05.630 --> 04:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
district from the state and the federal
 
04:32:07.349 --> 04:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
government for Revenue covering those
 
04:32:09.269 --> 04:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
expenditures and the final column being
 
04:32:10.750 --> 04:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
percent District covering expenditures
 
04:32:12.389 --> 04:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
so basically it's the remainder percent
 
04:32:14.269 --> 04:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
that would be covered um by local
 
04:32:18.070 --> 04:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue local taxation uh for each
 
04:32:21.349 --> 04:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
district and then at the top um my mine
 
04:32:22.990 --> 04:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
is color code I'm not sure if yours is
 
04:32:24.990 --> 04:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
but the uh top one you'll see Statewide
 
04:32:26.710 --> 04:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
totals that's just a sum of each one of
 
04:32:28.830 --> 04:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
those revenues and expenditures and then
 
04:32:30.670 --> 04:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
to the right is medians so that's just
 
04:32:33.269 --> 04:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
the median for each one of those um
 
04:32:35.510 --> 04:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
percent um covering expenditures for
 
04:32:50.990 --> 04:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:55.550 --> 04:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
04:32:58.990 --> 04:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
so my eye is drawn to my town Epsom on
 
04:33:01.910 --> 04:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
the first page here and what I don't
 
04:33:08.390 --> 04:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
understand is um it says that uh 3% is
 
04:33:14.029 --> 04:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
federal 9% is state but Federal is
 
04:33:17.109 --> 04:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
149,000 and state is
 
04:33:17.119 --> 04:33:18.830 align:start position:0%
149,000 and state is
242,000

04:33:18.830 --> 04:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
242,000
 
04:33:21.470 --> 04:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
so one's not three times the other
 
04:33:23.310 --> 04:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
number this thank you for the question
 
04:33:24.990 --> 04:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
the state would cover that would be both
 
04:33:26.789 --> 04:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
special education Aid Revenue that first
 
04:33:28.349 --> 04:33:28.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue column as well as differential
 
04:33:29.990 --> 04:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
Aid the second column so it's a sum of
 
04:33:32.109 --> 04:33:32.119 align:start position:0%
those two first columns are Revenue so
 
04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
State being special education Aid as
 
04:33:36.750 --> 04:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
well as State uh special education
 
04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
adequacy I see so it's more like 400
 
04:33:43.789 --> 04:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
total that sounds correct yes uh yes yep
 
04:33:49.551 --> 04:33:49.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:53.189 --> 04:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
much when you're looking at the special
 
04:33:56.070 --> 04:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
education Aid on that First
 
04:33:58.590 --> 04:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
Column that 34
 
04:34:01.789 --> 04:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
million for the state
 
04:34:04.670 --> 04:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
33.9 you have all those numbers down
 
04:34:07.109 --> 04:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
below have you broken it down any
 
04:34:12.429 --> 04:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
farther as far as um how expens like the
 
04:34:14.269 --> 04:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
number of of
 
04:34:17.429 --> 04:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
students uh for each like for
 
04:34:21.029 --> 04:34:21.039 align:start position:0%
example um ammer just it's right at the
 
04:34:25.150 --> 04:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:28.029 --> 04:34:28.039 align:start position:0%
$196,000 how many students does that
 
04:34:30.709 --> 04:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
involved my guess would be two but or
 
04:34:32.310 --> 04:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
maybe two two or three but we don't have
 
04:34:34.349 --> 04:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
this as part of this chart we provided
 
04:34:37.070 --> 04:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
it through other uh examples before but
 
04:34:39.910 --> 04:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
we haven't put that into this handout
 
04:34:39.920 --> 04:34:43.590 align:start position:0%
we haven't put that into this handout
necessarily

04:34:43.590 --> 04:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:44.949 --> 04:34:44.959 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have limitations when we
 
04:34:47.109 --> 04:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
try to do per student calculations
 
04:34:49.349 --> 04:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
because we have to have the granularity
 
04:34:51.990 --> 04:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
to match the cost with the student we
 
04:34:53.670 --> 04:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
have some ability to do that but for
 
04:34:55.670 --> 04:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
example if you're using admr that would
 
04:34:57.109 --> 04:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
include all the students you're tuition
 
04:34:59.029 --> 04:34:59.039 align:start position:0%
out um and the students you might
 
04:35:01.551 --> 04:35:01.561 align:start position:0%
educate educate inous um but your cost
 
04:35:03.349 --> 04:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
might associate spe special education
 
04:35:04.990 --> 04:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
students coming into your District so
 
04:35:06.990 --> 04:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
they can get a little um uh a little
 
04:35:09.029 --> 04:35:09.039 align:start position:0%
more Technical and into the weeds and if
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
you're going to match the student with
 
04:35:13.230 --> 04:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
the cost sometimes it just requires um
 
04:35:14.629 --> 04:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
drilling down and it can get a little
 
04:35:14.639 --> 04:35:20.510 align:start position:0%
drilling down and it can get a little
more

04:35:20.510 --> 04:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:20.520 --> 04:35:24.189 align:start position:0%
 
challenging

04:35:24.189 --> 04:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:26.310 --> 04:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
yes sorry thank
 
04:35:30.029 --> 04:35:30.039 align:start position:0%
you in the final column percent District
 
04:35:33.429 --> 04:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
covering expenses that the uh Statewide
 
04:35:35.429 --> 04:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
I guess average is
 
04:35:39.230 --> 04:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
85% there's a very small number of
 
04:35:41.429 --> 04:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
districts I said percent State covering
 
04:35:44.189 --> 04:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
I mean % District covering there's a
 
04:35:45.709 --> 04:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
very small number of
 
04:35:45.719 --> 04:35:47.349 align:start position:0%
very small number of
towns

04:35:47.349 --> 04:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
towns
 
04:35:50.510 --> 04:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
that the district coverage is much lower
 
04:35:52.551 --> 04:35:52.561 align:start position:0%
percentage like right on top of Albany
 
04:35:52.561 --> 04:35:53.551 align:start position:0%
percentage like right on top of Albany
at

04:35:53.551 --> 04:35:53.561 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:35:57.349 --> 04:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
28% further down the page Colombia at 5%
 
04:35:58.990 --> 04:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
there's a couple others in the
 
04:36:02.189 --> 04:36:02.199 align:start position:0%
20s how do they get to be such a low
 
04:36:05.709 --> 04:36:05.719 align:start position:0%
percent of the district paying the costs
 
04:36:07.789 --> 04:36:07.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh off top of
 
04:36:09.269 --> 04:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
my head those two districts you
 
04:36:11.109 --> 04:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned I believe are non-operating
 
04:36:12.429 --> 04:36:12.439 align:start position:0%
districts those are districts that don't
 
04:36:13.910 --> 04:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
operate their own schools so that
 
04:36:15.910 --> 04:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
students would attend out of District
 
04:36:17.510 --> 04:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
potentially so that that might be the
 
04:36:20.990 --> 04:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
case as well uh for that
 
04:36:24.670 --> 04:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
example so that when so how does that
 
04:36:26.470 --> 04:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't the sending town still have to
 
04:36:29.070 --> 04:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
pay when the district reports the
 
04:36:30.709 --> 04:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
expenditures total special special
 
04:36:32.990 --> 04:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
education expenditures on d25 that would
 
04:36:34.470 --> 04:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
be educating students in their own
 
04:36:36.109 --> 04:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
District so those costs would be
 
04:36:38.269 --> 04:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
included in tuition wouldn't necessarily
 
04:36:41.070 --> 04:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
um as as instructed on the du2 wouldn't
 
04:36:44.150 --> 04:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
be a cost Associated for expenditure of
 
04:36:45.390 --> 04:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
special education those would be
 
04:36:47.470 --> 04:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
attributed to tuition
 
04:36:50.390 --> 04:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
potentially I clarify that
 
04:36:54.269 --> 04:36:54.279 align:start position:0%
yes so Goan is one example of what I
 
04:36:56.310 --> 04:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
just asked about and it's in my district
 
04:36:59.510 --> 04:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
and so they're listed at 22% for the
 
04:37:01.750 --> 04:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
district covering the expenses and they
 
04:37:03.269 --> 04:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
are what you just described they have no
 
04:37:04.551 --> 04:37:04.561 align:start position:0%
school in town they tuition their
 
04:37:06.949 --> 04:37:06.959 align:start position:0%
students to other
 
04:37:09.189 --> 04:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
communities so I'm just trying to
 
04:37:13.390 --> 04:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
understand where does it if there is a
 
04:37:14.830 --> 04:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
student needing special education
 
04:37:17.590 --> 04:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
services from Goan let's say being
 
04:37:20.551 --> 04:37:20.561 align:start position:0%
educated in Newport down the road so are
 
04:37:22.910 --> 04:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
their expenses showing up in the Newport
 
04:37:26.470 --> 04:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
data uh both places actually but well it
 
04:37:28.189 --> 04:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
could be both places so there's double
 
04:37:30.310 --> 04:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
counting in here when you try to sum up
 
04:37:32.551 --> 04:37:32.561 align:start position:0%
and look at it but each Goan would need
 
04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
to report um expenditures tuition and
 
04:37:36.990 --> 04:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
and Newport would need to uh produce
 
04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
expenditures as far as teacher a teacher
 
04:37:41.629 --> 04:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
they hired so it would show up twice one
 
04:37:43.830 --> 04:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
of the challenges is not every district
 
04:37:45.590 --> 04:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
has a I don't know what H Go's agreement
 
04:37:47.709 --> 04:37:47.719 align:start position:0%
is but sometimes they don't have
 
04:37:49.709 --> 04:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
separate tuition agreements that cover
 
04:37:51.510 --> 04:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
special education costs so sometimes
 
04:37:54.590 --> 04:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
they have a one a one price tuition
 
04:37:56.990 --> 04:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
agreement so they they say Newport will
 
04:37:58.310 --> 04:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
accept your students and this will be
 
04:38:00.109 --> 04:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
the cost per student sometimes they
 
04:38:01.551 --> 04:38:01.561 align:start position:0%
carve it out and say a non-sp special
 
04:38:03.269 --> 04:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
education student shall be this cost
 
04:38:04.789 --> 04:38:04.799 align:start position:0%
special education student shall be of
 
04:38:07.150 --> 04:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
this cost so when Goan pays that tuition
 
04:38:09.109 --> 04:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
bill they might not actually parse out
 
04:38:10.470 --> 04:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
from an accounting perspective on the
 
04:38:14.109 --> 04:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
doe2 those exacts cost and when Newport
 
04:38:15.150 --> 04:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
receives that student and this is a
 
04:38:16.429 --> 04:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
hypothetical I don't know their tuition
 
04:38:19.470 --> 04:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
agreement they might not hypothetically
 
04:38:21.109 --> 04:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
parse out that revenue is being special
 
04:38:22.789 --> 04:38:22.799 align:start position:0%
education Revenue so there are
 
04:38:25.269 --> 04:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
limitations to the doe2 based on the
 
04:38:26.551 --> 04:38:26.561 align:start position:0%
limitations of the accounting that
 
04:38:29.230 --> 04:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
school districts do to actually account
 
04:38:31.709 --> 04:38:31.719 align:start position:0%
for um specifically special education
 
04:38:33.429 --> 04:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
costs so there's limitation and we see
 
04:38:38.230 --> 04:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
that in the doe2 as you drill day thank
 
04:38:41.750 --> 04:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
you yes represent papovich thank you Mr
 
04:38:43.429 --> 04:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
CH just to follow up on what you were
 
04:38:46.109 --> 04:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
just saying I understand that you cannot
 
04:38:47.670 --> 04:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
report the data you have and if you
 
04:38:49.910 --> 04:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
don't have that data you cannot report
 
04:38:53.510 --> 04:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
it at a you know more accurate level but
 
04:38:56.349 --> 04:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
would you feel that in this summary with
 
04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
the exception of a couple of small
 
04:39:01.230 --> 04:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
districts would this have any material
 
04:39:03.709 --> 04:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
impact on this spreadsheet because the
 
04:39:05.429 --> 04:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
numbers look to be tiny the ones that
 
04:39:06.949 --> 04:39:06.959 align:start position:0%
are duplicated but I don't want to just
 
04:39:09.070 --> 04:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
assume I would appreciate your thought
 
04:39:11.429 --> 04:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
in terms of what order of magnitude
 
04:39:14.029 --> 04:39:14.039 align:start position:0%
there or maybe maybe we looking at
 
04:39:15.629 --> 04:39:15.639 align:start position:0%
understanding cannot be corrected but
 
04:39:17.349 --> 04:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
what do I need to adjust for do you know
 
04:39:21.070 --> 04:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:23.109 --> 04:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
County um yeah I think the number the
 
04:39:24.910 --> 04:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
double counting so we do ask districts
 
04:39:27.230 --> 04:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
to to report what data they do have we
 
04:39:29.869 --> 04:39:29.879 align:start position:0%
do ask them to report us uh to us what
 
04:39:32.429 --> 04:39:32.439 align:start position:0%
special education costs were paid to
 
04:39:34.230 --> 04:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
another New Hampshire school district
 
04:39:36.029 --> 04:39:36.039 align:start position:0%
and that number usually hovers around 12
 
04:39:39.868 --> 04:39:39.878 align:start position:0%
million a year so that Topline number um
 
04:39:41.788 --> 04:39:41.798 align:start position:0%
has about $12 million in double counting
 
04:39:44.190 --> 04:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
so on the grand scale of things not not
 
04:39:44.200 --> 04:39:46.910 align:start position:0%
so on the grand scale of things not not
super

04:39:46.910 --> 04:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:50.990 --> 04:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
material no I I I understand why schools
 
04:39:53.070 --> 04:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
are screaming and yelling about this
 
04:39:55.510 --> 04:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
when I look at this really portrays it
 
04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
well on the right hand side looks like
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just going down here 85% of
 
04:40:04.230 --> 04:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
these costs are paid by the
 
04:40:08.830 --> 04:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
local 5% by the feds and the FEDS got us
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
in this business saying they're going to
 
04:40:12.708 --> 04:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
pay 40%
 
04:40:14.910 --> 04:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
here we are we consistently see these
 
04:40:18.070 --> 04:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
numbers yeah that but I I have a
 
04:40:20.750 --> 04:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
question and Terry just brought it up to
 
04:40:23.550 --> 04:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
me and I I have this I'm looking at my
 
04:40:25.390 --> 04:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
town of
 
04:40:28.830 --> 04:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
havil and we have no special education
 
04:40:32.030 --> 04:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
Aid yet we have our own school which
 
04:40:33.750 --> 04:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
we're providing some of that support
 
04:40:36.190 --> 04:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
don't we get funded for that
 
04:40:39.350 --> 04:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
support uh uh special education aid
 
04:40:42.230 --> 04:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
meaning uh um have somebody up and down
 
04:40:45.190 --> 04:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
and up and down over here so so no uh um
 
04:40:46.990 --> 04:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
uh if if you have student coming from
 
04:40:49.868 --> 04:40:49.878 align:start position:0%
Benton to hail yeah um and that student
 
04:40:51.510 --> 04:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
is a high cost bed student being
 
04:40:53.470 --> 04:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
educated by hav roll now typically those
 
04:40:56.030 --> 04:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
high cost students are not going to holl
 
04:40:57.390 --> 04:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to an out of District
 
04:41:01.190 --> 04:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
placement um but uh in that scenario if
 
04:41:03.110 --> 04:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
hail was educating a high cost special
 
04:41:06.670 --> 04:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
education student um the money the
 
04:41:08.788 --> 04:41:08.798 align:start position:0%
revenue would show up in Benton if the
 
04:41:10.948 --> 04:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
student lived in Benton um or some some
 
04:41:13.230 --> 04:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
neighbor in town I I get that and know
 
04:41:15.190 --> 04:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
because we have a number of towns but
 
04:41:19.150 --> 04:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
Hao itself does have kids but we we're
 
04:41:20.670 --> 04:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
sending them to a separate School while
 
04:41:22.430 --> 04:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
we're doing it
 
04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
ourselves I I I I have to ask the local
 
04:41:27.110 --> 04:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
people about oh so hail does have high
 
04:41:28.628 --> 04:41:28.638 align:start position:0%
cost special education students we have
 
04:41:29.868 --> 04:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
King Street
 
04:41:32.750 --> 04:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
school it's a separate School within the
 
04:41:33.990 --> 04:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
public school
 
04:41:36.788 --> 04:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
system okay and I'll to ask them this is
 
04:41:38.990 --> 04:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
not part of today's discussion this
 
04:41:39.000 --> 04:41:39.830 align:start position:0%
not part of today's discussion this
another

04:41:39.830 --> 04:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:41:42.270 --> 04:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
deal um
 
04:41:46.470 --> 04:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:48.628 --> 04:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
fellows just tell us which numbers
 
04:41:52.550 --> 04:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
you're using are you using adma or
 
04:41:52.560 --> 04:41:55.270 align:start position:0%
you're using are you using adma or
admr

04:41:55.270 --> 04:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
admr
 
04:41:58.750 --> 04:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
and and the special ed that's one
 
04:42:00.230 --> 04:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
question and the other one is the
 
04:42:03.390 --> 04:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
special ed Aid which is formally called
 
04:42:08.270 --> 04:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
catastrophic um is that going
 
04:42:12.190 --> 04:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
to um it probably goes to whomever pays
 
04:42:15.030 --> 04:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
the bill which could be the District of
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
residents or it could be the um
 
04:42:20.310 --> 04:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
receiving districts that is not our
 
04:42:21.670 --> 04:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
program but it goes to the district of
 
04:42:24.270 --> 04:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility so District of residents
 
04:42:27.430 --> 04:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:29.310 --> 04:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
Works um and I don't know if there's any
 
04:42:30.868 --> 04:42:30.878 align:start position:0%
ADM on this data
 
04:42:33.230 --> 04:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
set I think it
 
04:42:36.430 --> 04:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
could Poss well I don't know I know it
 
04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
gets up kind of high but it could be
 
04:42:42.390 --> 04:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
going to it so the money could go to the
 
04:42:45.510 --> 04:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
district of residence because in case of
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton and in Dairy maybe the actual
 
04:42:51.708 --> 04:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
expenditures are well we can't even see
 
04:42:54.510 --> 04:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
the expenditures of Pinkerton this is a
 
04:42:55.830 --> 04:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
little inside baseball they're they're
 
04:42:57.670 --> 04:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
doing a SD level they're doing a SD
 
04:43:01.590 --> 04:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
level uh uh uh they have the SD of the
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
date of the high cost student so we know
 
04:43:05.590 --> 04:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's a district of Resident student okay
 
04:43:07.110 --> 04:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
now these costs which I'm seeing the
 
04:43:09.788 --> 04:43:09.798 align:start position:0%
First Column are 33. $34 million you
 
04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
can't really that's what you projector
 
04:43:13.550 --> 04:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
or is that what you
 
04:43:16.190 --> 04:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
prated that's the final pration amount
 
04:43:18.230 --> 04:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's the pration amount so the actual
 
04:43:21.310 --> 04:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
amount is 501 for
 
04:43:23.750 --> 04:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
expenditures well that would be claim
 
04:43:25.910 --> 04:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
the um submitted claims the entit yeah
 
04:43:28.230 --> 04:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
the entitled again this is not our Pro
 
04:43:31.270 --> 04:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
yes um $33 million almost $34 million
 
04:43:32.990 --> 04:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
would be the amount that was actually
 
04:43:34.990 --> 04:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
paid through special education Aid to
 
04:43:42.030 --> 04:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:45.550 --> 04:43:45.560 align:start position:0%
so yes go ahead so the the difference
 
04:43:48.310 --> 04:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
there between the the 51 and the and the
 
04:43:50.350 --> 04:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
33 that would be picked up in the total
 
04:43:54.670 --> 04:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:57.230 --> 04:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
column yeah that number would live there
 
04:44:02.030 --> 04:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:02.040 --> 04:44:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:44:03.830 --> 04:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:44:08.470 --> 04:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um sorry I'm a little
 
04:44:09.910 --> 04:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
confused so if you guys have already
 
04:44:12.150 --> 04:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
answered this it didn't stick so I
 
04:44:15.390 --> 04:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
apologize for that um so looking at a
 
04:44:18.708 --> 04:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
couple of towns Windsor and um Rivendell
 
04:44:21.110 --> 04:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
at the end so why would they have
 
04:44:23.788 --> 04:44:23.798 align:start position:0%
differential aid but no other Aid can
 
04:44:28.390 --> 04:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
you help clear that up in my head
 
04:44:30.550 --> 04:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
please sure thank you for the question I
 
04:44:33.270 --> 04:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
suspect that that's are very small those
 
04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
are very small districts where there
 
04:44:36.110 --> 04:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
might be students that are special
 
04:44:37.670 --> 04:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
education uh that are eligible for
 
04:44:41.310 --> 04:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
special education but they aren't in the
 
04:44:43.350 --> 04:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
special education aid program so they're
 
04:44:45.190 --> 04:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
relatively a lowcost special education
 
04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
student um so it might only be for
 
04:44:50.590 --> 04:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
example Windsor um that looks to be
 
04:44:53.868 --> 04:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
about three or four students uh or two
 
04:44:56.390 --> 04:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
students for that are eligible for
 
04:44:58.550 --> 04:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
differential aid for adequacy special
 
04:45:02.230 --> 04:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
education adequacy but they just aren't
 
04:45:03.750 --> 04:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
right they're just not a potentially
 
04:45:05.070 --> 04:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
high cost student that would be eligible
 
04:45:07.788 --> 04:45:07.798 align:start position:0%
for the uh CAD a program special educate
 
04:45:09.670 --> 04:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
and rivale is an interstate School
 
04:45:16.350 --> 04:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.670 --> 04:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
couple couple things rivendale we don't
 
04:45:20.350 --> 04:45:20.360 align:start position:0%
get fin natureal reports on them Vermont
 
04:45:26.990 --> 04:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:31.830 --> 04:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh Vermont in between in between uh
 
04:45:37.230 --> 04:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:39.310 --> 04:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
halfway some districts particularly
 
04:45:40.670 --> 04:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
small districts don't take advantage of
 
04:45:42.470 --> 04:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
ID a so w that might be a situation
 
04:45:43.830 --> 04:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
Windsor might have an allocation but
 
04:45:45.510 --> 04:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
they might not I I don't know for a fact
 
04:45:46.990 --> 04:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
you'd have to get special education
 
04:45:50.030 --> 04:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
Bureau staff in here but um I think you
 
04:45:51.550 --> 04:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
answer it well another thing to point
 
04:45:54.868 --> 04:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
out um this data set Special Education
 
04:45:57.230 --> 04:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
data the cost is from the previous year
 
04:45:58.830 --> 04:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
the revenue comes in the next year so
 
04:46:01.350 --> 04:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
there's a one-year lag on this data um
 
04:46:03.270 --> 04:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
so you could see some mix matching from
 
04:46:06.590 --> 04:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
from from that as well follow on yes so
 
04:46:07.868 --> 04:46:07.878 align:start position:0%
where you were talking about there were
 
04:46:09.750 --> 04:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
some duplications in numbers Windsor
 
04:46:11.830 --> 04:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
tuitions into Hillsboro Dearing so would
 
04:46:13.708 --> 04:46:13.718 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro Dearing also be showing that
 
04:46:16.070 --> 04:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
8,000 on their report that' be duplicate
 
04:46:17.830 --> 04:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
cost if it's reported if it's a report
 
04:46:20.788 --> 04:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
on the doe2 it' be duplicated so is the
 
04:46:22.910 --> 04:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
do25 just a state form or is that
 
04:46:26.110 --> 04:46:26.120 align:start position:0%
federal state form thank you represent
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
May Mayhem thank you for taking my
 
04:46:31.310 --> 04:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you for this stuff of
 
04:46:33.470 --> 04:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
nightmare I just have a couple of things
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
it it looks like Stark when the
 
04:46:38.788 --> 04:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
motherload was 71% state and federal aid
 
04:46:43.430 --> 04:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
but then the the 55% at Unity strikes me
 
04:46:45.030 --> 04:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
as a message to Congress are you telling
 
04:46:48.628 --> 04:46:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:52.310 --> 04:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:56.230 --> 04:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
155% so that could be um um a student
 
04:46:58.670 --> 04:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
the cost what that could be a situation
 
04:47:00.510 --> 04:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
where the cost for the high cost SP uh
 
04:47:05.150 --> 04:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
special education student was uh um they
 
04:47:06.628 --> 04:47:06.638 align:start position:0%
received the revenue it could be a
 
04:47:08.310 --> 04:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
mismatch between when the revenue came
 
04:47:10.510 --> 04:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
in and when the costs were incurred so
 
04:47:13.948 --> 04:47:13.958 align:start position:0%
if they had uh the cost in the previous
 
04:47:15.310 --> 04:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
year so if they had the cost in fiscal
 
04:47:17.670 --> 04:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
year 23 they would have been they would
 
04:47:19.590 --> 04:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
have paid that cost in 23 and then they
 
04:47:21.310 --> 04:47:21.320 align:start position:0%
would have received Revenue in 24 but
 
04:47:23.030 --> 04:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
let's say that student graduated so that
 
04:47:24.470 --> 04:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
could be a situation like that where a
 
04:47:26.948 --> 04:47:26.958 align:start position:0%
bunch of a bunch of the one you're lag
 
04:47:28.628 --> 04:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
in revenue is making it look really like
 
04:47:31.910 --> 04:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
they're profiting essentially um uh but
 
04:47:32.990 --> 04:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's probably what that could
 
04:47:34.548 --> 04:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
be What's Happening
 
04:47:39.510 --> 04:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
Here Mr chair if I may yes go ahead so
 
04:47:40.948 --> 04:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
this comes back to what I was going to
 
04:47:43.390 --> 04:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
ask right because you are reporting here
 
04:47:47.390 --> 04:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
the 24 Aid and expenditures but just to
 
04:47:49.190 --> 04:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
summarize that I understand correctly
 
04:47:52.910 --> 04:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
the 248 is calculated based on the 23
 
04:47:55.868 --> 04:47:55.878 align:start position:0%
expenditures so for most large districts
 
04:47:57.350 --> 04:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't be meaningful because you
 
04:47:59.310 --> 04:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
figure same kid number of kids get in
 
04:48:01.628 --> 04:48:01.638 align:start position:0%
and out of the program for really small
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
districts where there are two students
 
04:48:06.190 --> 04:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
if a new one comes in suddenly they are
 
04:48:07.750 --> 04:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
going to look horribly underfunded
 
04:48:09.430 --> 04:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
because they're getting revenues based
 
04:48:10.948 --> 04:48:10.958 align:start position:0%
on two students but they really have
 
04:48:14.190 --> 04:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
three now or the other side where they
 
04:48:16.430 --> 04:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
have two students the previous year they
 
04:48:18.030 --> 04:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
get the revenue for the two students but
 
04:48:20.110 --> 04:48:20.120 align:start position:0%
now one student is no longer there so
 
04:48:21.470 --> 04:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
they appear to get even more than they
 
04:48:24.788 --> 04:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
are spending so this is what you know
 
04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
we're looking at because there is a data
 
04:48:29.070 --> 04:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
you know data is really from two
 
04:48:29.080 --> 04:48:30.070 align:start position:0%
you know data is really from two
separate

04:48:30.070 --> 04:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
separate
 
04:48:33.150 --> 04:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
years there may be some timing issues
 
04:48:35.430 --> 04:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
that we need to be careful for yeah we
 
04:48:36.788 --> 04:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
we've been doing this report for a few
 
04:48:38.628 --> 04:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
years now because it it's a a frequently
 
04:48:40.270 --> 04:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
Asked report um but we probably need to
 
04:48:42.310 --> 04:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
consider maybe syncing up the years with
 
04:48:44.910 --> 04:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
the data set so it would be a nice
 
04:48:47.110 --> 04:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
choice you know because I mean if you
 
04:48:48.750 --> 04:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
already have the data looking at it
 
04:48:50.830 --> 04:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
longitudinal it wouldn't be that big of
 
04:48:53.390 --> 04:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
a deal and you can see anyway thank you
 
04:48:56.030 --> 04:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
y I've got a question on differentiated
 
04:48:59.510 --> 04:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
Aid um that seems to be a huge category
 
04:49:01.788 --> 04:49:01.798 align:start position:0%
here uh
 
04:49:06.030 --> 04:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
of oh what 90 or how much money are
 
04:49:08.590 --> 04:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
right here
 
04:49:12.350 --> 04:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
68.7 estimated and going forward for FY
 
04:49:17.150 --> 04:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
26 um is there any way we could find
 
04:49:21.230 --> 04:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
out what are the case loads of various
 
04:49:23.030 --> 04:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
special education teachers in the
 
04:49:24.750 --> 04:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
building what's the average case load
 
04:49:27.830 --> 04:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
for a speech pathologist a physical
 
04:49:31.948 --> 04:49:31.958 align:start position:0%
therapist a old resource room teacher uh
 
04:49:33.868 --> 04:49:33.878 align:start position:0%
older you know where that's used to be
 
04:49:36.310 --> 04:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
they all went to the resource room or
 
04:49:39.390 --> 04:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
any of the 13 categorical areas what are
 
04:49:41.350 --> 04:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
the casee loads
 
04:49:43.350 --> 04:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
and then we could figure out okay what
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
is the average cost of a teacher it's
 
04:49:50.788 --> 04:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
sort of like we do with a formula for uh
 
04:49:53.030 --> 04:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
base cost for a teacher for a principal
 
04:49:57.590 --> 04:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
Etc we have uh so many kids for uh 25
 
04:50:01.350 --> 04:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
to1 30 to1 what is the ratio of case
 
04:50:04.910 --> 04:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
load to the special education teacher so
 
04:50:06.470 --> 04:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think we'd get granular as far
 
04:50:09.190 --> 04:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
as each individual teacher and their
 
04:50:11.830 --> 04:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
individual case load um but probably
 
04:50:14.270 --> 04:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
what we could do is um we have a I
 
04:50:16.110 --> 04:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
believe we have a survey of all special
 
04:50:17.590 --> 04:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
education teachers submitted to the
 
04:50:19.910 --> 04:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
state so we could take a tally of all
 
04:50:21.230 --> 04:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
special education teachers within a
 
04:50:22.548 --> 04:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
district and then we could take a tally
 
04:50:24.628 --> 04:50:24.638 align:start position:0%
of all divided by all special education
 
04:50:25.910 --> 04:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
students in the district and that would
 
04:50:27.948 --> 04:50:27.958 align:start position:0%
get you essentially an average case load
 
04:50:29.548 --> 04:50:29.558 align:start position:0%
uh per teacher but it wouldn't get you
 
04:50:31.390 --> 04:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't get you too granular but it
 
04:50:33.230 --> 04:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
would get you a district average where
 
04:50:36.030 --> 04:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to go Mark is that I've been
 
04:50:38.430 --> 04:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
in school districts where I've seen a
 
04:50:41.628 --> 04:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
child who needed little articulation
 
04:50:44.510 --> 04:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
didn't know to say R whatever a tongue
 
04:50:48.270 --> 04:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
thrust or whatever and and in one
 
04:50:51.470 --> 04:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
District that child got two days per
 
04:50:54.110 --> 04:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
week the same type issue another
 
04:50:56.788 --> 04:50:56.798 align:start position:0%
District may get five times a
 
04:51:00.830 --> 04:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
week so the way it's being administered
 
04:51:02.670 --> 04:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
in the buildings is based upon maybe
 
04:51:04.910 --> 04:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
Staffing or maybe the individual people
 
04:51:07.948 --> 04:51:07.958 align:start position:0%
at the IEP meeting a lot of variables
 
04:51:10.230 --> 04:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
but it's putting our C it's hard to find
 
04:51:13.910 --> 04:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
out what is the cost of a speech teacher
 
04:51:16.110 --> 04:51:16.120 align:start position:0%
seeing that it's the local decision is
 
04:51:18.270 --> 04:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
one which is contributing to what the
 
04:51:20.670 --> 04:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
costs are we the the analysis you're
 
04:51:22.270 --> 04:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
describing actually getting into the
 
04:51:24.910 --> 04:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
cost of a speed pathology teacher yeah
 
04:51:26.868 --> 04:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
um we can't do that analysis because
 
04:51:29.310 --> 04:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
that's not on the doe2 um we'd have all
 
04:51:32.030 --> 04:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
special education employment costs um
 
04:51:33.430 --> 04:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just well unless the special
 
04:51:34.830 --> 04:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
education Bureau I which I don't believe
 
04:51:37.910 --> 04:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
they have uh uh maybe Ida has some data
 
04:51:40.708 --> 04:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
but um I can't provide that analysis on
 
04:51:40.718 --> 04:51:45.948 align:start position:0%
but um I can't provide that analysis on
the

04:51:45.948 --> 04:51:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:50.350 --> 04:51:50.360 align:start position:0%
doe2 I know you be next Kei represent
 
04:51:54.350 --> 04:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
her why you just a very simple question
 
04:51:56.990 --> 04:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
on the on the very last page the
 
04:51:59.430 --> 04:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
historical Trends
 
04:52:03.070 --> 04:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
page it the top bar says to the left of
 
04:52:05.150 --> 04:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
it attributed to the number of students
 
04:52:06.670 --> 04:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
and then below that attributed to the
 
04:52:08.310 --> 04:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
average cost per student could you just
 
04:52:10.510 --> 04:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
explain what the what's going on there
 
04:52:11.310 --> 04:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
what the differential what the
 
04:52:12.868 --> 04:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
difference is sorry which document are
 
04:52:14.868 --> 04:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
you is it oh I look at the long of the
 
04:52:17.150 --> 04:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
same hand up oh that's didn't you guys
 
04:52:20.788 --> 04:52:20.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:22.948 --> 04:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
yeah and by the way be nice you could
 
04:52:25.230 --> 04:52:25.240 align:start position:0%
have sent me the
 
04:52:27.070 --> 04:52:27.080 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets he always wants it in
 
04:52:28.470 --> 04:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
digital format but that's not what I'm
 
04:52:29.830 --> 04:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
asking I'm just asking about it's
 
04:52:31.110 --> 04:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
actually you wanted me to show give you
 
04:52:32.750 --> 04:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
this yeah I apologize we don't have that
 
04:52:40.750 --> 04:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:45.548 --> 04:52:45.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
out Jennifer got it for
 
04:52:51.830 --> 04:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
us and
 
04:52:51.840 --> 04:52:57.110 align:start position:0%
us and
okay

04:52:57.110 --> 04:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:59.270 --> 04:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
yeah must been pretty okay sorry now
 
04:53:00.628 --> 04:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
that we have it uh would you be able to
 
04:53:03.628 --> 04:53:03.638 align:start position:0%
repeat your question pardon me just
 
04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
weren't sure which what the question was
 
04:53:06.948 --> 04:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
we're looking at it now though the
 
04:53:09.070 --> 04:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
question is over to the left there the
 
04:53:11.910 --> 04:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
two top big bars if you will one says
 
04:53:13.750 --> 04:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
attributed to number of students and
 
04:53:14.788 --> 04:53:14.798 align:start position:0%
this is talking about basically the
 
04:53:18.830 --> 04:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
breakdown of cat Aid ratios or brackets
 
04:53:20.110 --> 04:53:20.120 align:start position:0%
and the next the one below it says
 
04:53:22.548 --> 04:53:22.558 align:start position:0%
attributed to average cost per student
 
04:53:25.110 --> 04:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand what thank you
 
04:53:28.230 --> 04:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
what that's talking about yes this was a
 
04:53:30.310 --> 04:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
the goal was to look at each year this
 
04:53:31.788 --> 04:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
is specifically for special education
 
04:53:36.990 --> 04:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
Aid each year the cost difference and
 
04:53:39.510 --> 04:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
which what the cost increase year toye
 
04:53:41.830 --> 04:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
or cost decrease would be attributed to
 
04:53:44.110 --> 04:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
average cost per student or the amount
 
04:53:46.830 --> 04:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
of students so it's essentially in a way
 
04:53:51.510 --> 04:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
cost accounting so for example for FY 24
 
04:53:53.270 --> 04:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
the top one attributed to number of
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
students has a $13 million figure while
 
04:53:58.670 --> 04:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
the bottom uh below one has for the
 
04:54:00.590 --> 04:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
attributed to average cost per student
 
04:54:03.030 --> 04:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
is about 10 million that's essentially
 
04:54:06.350 --> 04:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
taking and if I misspeak I apologize I
 
04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at I haven't looked the
 
04:54:09.110 --> 04:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
formulas in a while but it would be
 
04:54:10.670 --> 04:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
basically looking at the amount of
 
04:54:14.548 --> 04:54:14.558 align:start position:0%
students in FY 24 multiply that by the
 
04:54:17.548 --> 04:54:17.558 align:start position:0%
average cost of the previous year and
 
04:54:19.190 --> 04:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
then the reverse or the inverse so
 
04:54:21.150 --> 04:54:21.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the average cost of this year
 
04:54:24.430 --> 04:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
FY 24 and then multiplying that by the
 
04:54:26.350 --> 04:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
amount of students in the previous year
 
04:54:29.628 --> 04:54:29.638 align:start position:0%
so where there is
 
04:54:32.788 --> 04:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
a uh I apologize it's about uh it would
 
04:54:35.390 --> 04:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
be the the the sum of 13 Mill the 13
 
04:54:37.590 --> 04:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
million figure and the 10 million figure
 
04:54:40.150 --> 04:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
that would be the split of which would
 
04:54:41.990 --> 04:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
be the cost that's attribut to the
 
04:54:44.190 --> 04:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
amount of students verus the average
 
04:54:47.830 --> 04:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
cost per student thank you follow yes so
 
04:54:49.230 --> 04:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
did you produce these or did the
 
04:54:50.190 --> 04:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
department to produce all these
 
04:54:51.750 --> 04:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets I did yes yeah I did this
 
04:54:52.910 --> 04:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
one particular would you send them to me
 
04:54:54.470 --> 04:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
have a chance later on sure yes thank
 
04:54:55.788 --> 04:54:55.798 align:start position:0%
you with the
 
04:55:00.670 --> 04:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:03.628 --> 04:55:03.638 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead rebury so am I reading
 
04:55:06.830 --> 04:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
this correctly take
 
04:55:11.548 --> 04:55:11.558 align:start position:0%
2017 if you add the 5 thou 5,6 21 that's
 
04:55:14.430 --> 04:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
attributed to student count plus the
 
04:55:20.230 --> 04:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
2,22 th000 which is attributed to um
 
04:55:26.150 --> 04:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:28.750 --> 04:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
7,643 is the difference the inflation
 
04:55:31.230 --> 04:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
Factor basically between the 75 million
 
04:55:31.240 --> 04:55:32.110 align:start position:0%
Factor basically between the 75 million
for

04:55:32.110 --> 04:55:32.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:55:36.750 --> 04:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
2017 and the 82 million 600,000 for
 
04:55:40.430 --> 04:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
2018 is that correct it would be the the
 
04:55:42.628 --> 04:55:42.638 align:start position:0%
two figures would be the increase from
 
04:55:46.910 --> 04:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
fy7 from fy16 to 17 so the current year
 
04:55:51.070 --> 04:55:51.080 align:start position:0%
total sped amount of 82 million seems if
 
04:55:53.750 --> 04:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm looking at it it looks to
 
04:55:57.310 --> 04:55:57.320 align:start position:0%
me like the two subfigures there the two
 
04:55:59.350 --> 04:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
subtotals under
 
04:56:02.670 --> 04:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
17 make up the increase to
 
04:56:05.830 --> 04:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
18 and the two subfigures in 18 make up
 
04:56:11.548 --> 04:56:11.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:13.590 --> 04:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
certain yes right so you're you're
 
04:56:18.948 --> 04:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:21.350 --> 04:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
um the difference
 
04:56:23.750 --> 04:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
between whether costs are increasing
 
04:56:26.270 --> 04:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
because of student count versus cost per
 
04:56:26.280 --> 04:56:36.030 align:start position:0%
because of student count versus cost per
student

04:56:36.030 --> 04:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:36.040 --> 04:56:39.070 align:start position:0%
 
correct

04:56:39.070 --> 04:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:41.070 --> 04:56:41.080 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
04:56:43.948 --> 04:56:43.958 align:start position:0%
so on the on the last
 
04:56:46.510 --> 04:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
page where you've got um Statewide
 
04:56:48.310 --> 04:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
student enrollment it's the second to
 
04:56:50.430 --> 04:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
the last um
 
04:57:09.150 --> 04:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:13.230 --> 04:57:13.240 align:start position:0%
169,170 number here is 169 131 but the
 
04:57:17.910 --> 04:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
2004 number you use in the adequacy um
 
04:57:22.548 --> 04:57:22.558 align:start position:0%
um estimate for FY 26 is estimated 2425
 
04:57:24.548 --> 04:57:24.558 align:start position:0%
membership so
 
04:57:29.190 --> 04:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
that's I I I guess um you know based
 
04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:42.628 --> 04:57:42.638 align:start position:0%
thank you I suspect it would be the
 
04:57:45.190 --> 04:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
combination of so the second number you
 
04:57:47.510 --> 04:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned would be for adequa estimating
 
04:57:49.670 --> 04:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
adequacy and so that would exclude
 
04:57:51.830 --> 04:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
Charter students it would exclude parent
 
04:57:53.548 --> 04:57:53.558 align:start position:0%
paid education Freedom account it was
 
04:57:56.750 --> 04:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
also exclude preschool and postgraduate
 
04:57:58.470 --> 04:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
um off top of my head that probably
 
04:58:01.030 --> 04:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't amount to 15,000 maybe I'm not
 
04:58:05.070 --> 04:58:05.080 align:start position:0%
too sure um I suppose yeah 5,000 charter
 
04:58:07.070 --> 04:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
school students 5,000 EFA students so it
 
04:58:08.590 --> 04:58:08.600 align:start position:0%
could be getting that could be what it's
 
04:58:12.470 --> 04:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:15.430 --> 04:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean because it's it's it's about
 
04:58:15.440 --> 04:58:17.110 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean because it's it's it's about
18,000

04:58:17.110 --> 04:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
18,000
 
04:58:21.390 --> 04:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
off 177,000 off and additionally also
 
04:58:23.868 --> 04:58:23.878 align:start position:0%
that would be the enrollment versus ADM
 
04:58:25.948 --> 04:58:25.958 align:start position:0%
r that we calculated through the uh
 
04:58:27.350 --> 04:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
estimate as well so the enrollment would
 
04:58:30.910 --> 04:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
be higher um mostly higher as well yeah
 
04:58:34.350 --> 04:58:34.360 align:start position:0%
so adequacy excludes prek and excludes
 
04:58:35.990 --> 04:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
um out of state
 
04:58:38.670 --> 04:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
students all right so this
 
04:58:43.270 --> 04:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
includes this prek and well this doesn't
 
04:58:45.510 --> 04:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
says New Hampshire residents oh okay
 
04:58:47.350 --> 04:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
never mind then and it says submissions
 
04:58:47.360 --> 04:58:48.230 align:start position:0%
never mind then and it says submissions
by

04:58:48.230 --> 04:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:58:53.270 --> 04:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
districts so so Does it include um
 
04:58:55.510 --> 04:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
Charters we'll have to dig into the data
 
04:58:57.628 --> 04:58:57.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank it it's it's a question that
 
04:59:05.150 --> 04:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:11.110 --> 04:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:11.120 --> 04:59:20.030 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:59:20.030 --> 04:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:22.868 --> 04:59:22.878 align:start position:0%
students is that percent of students
 
04:59:22.878 --> 04:59:24.590 align:start position:0%
students is that percent of students
with

04:59:24.590 --> 04:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:59:28.470 --> 04:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
IEPs a percentage of the whole of all
 
04:59:30.510 --> 04:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
the kids in our state or what is it when
 
04:59:37.628 --> 04:59:37.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:41.230 --> 04:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
what it has to be like the 151,000 kids
 
04:59:44.990 --> 04:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:49.470 --> 04:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
have which page are you I'm on the last
 
04:59:53.510 --> 04:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
page Final Call final call T typically
 
04:59:57.150 --> 04:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
around 20 20% of students have IEPs um
 
04:59:58.628 --> 04:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
this particular metric we might need to
 
05:00:00.548 --> 05:00:00.558 align:start position:0%
dig into the data exactly what's the we
 
05:00:01.628 --> 05:00:01.638 align:start position:0%
well the numerator would be students
 
05:00:03.590 --> 05:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
with an IEP um we do need to probably
 
05:00:05.628 --> 05:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
dig into what exactly is the denominator
 
05:00:07.350 --> 05:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
but generally over the past few years
 
05:00:09.350 --> 05:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
just looking at adequacy adequacy data
 
05:00:10.948 --> 05:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
which is produced and published every
 
05:00:13.430 --> 05:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
every year of course um uh the number
 
05:00:16.150 --> 05:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
has been around 20% um actually I think
 
05:00:17.628 --> 05:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
I've looked at it since the pandemic it
 
05:00:19.030 --> 05:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
has been growing the percentage students
 
05:00:21.190 --> 05:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
with an IEP um has been growing since
 
05:00:23.350 --> 05:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
the pandemic by a few few percentage
 
05:00:25.190 --> 05:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
points um and if you look at adequacy
 
05:00:27.470 --> 05:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets you could see that as well
 
05:00:28.750 --> 05:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
but this particular metric I think we
 
05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
need to dig into how we're measuring the
 
05:00:32.390 --> 05:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
denominator to get you um the fully
 
05:00:33.110 --> 05:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
answer that question that kind of
 
05:00:36.990 --> 05:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
reflects correctly with 17% in 2017 with
 
05:00:39.990 --> 05:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
32,000 kids and then you're coming over
 
05:00:42.350 --> 05:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
here with 36,000 kids with
 
05:00:44.510 --> 05:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
21 yeah that's a trend we've seen in the
 
05:00:45.788 --> 05:00:45.798 align:start position:0%
data the data has been showing that
 
05:00:45.798 --> 05:00:52.230 align:start position:0%
data the data has been showing that
consistently

05:00:52.230 --> 05:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:52.240 --> 05:00:54.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:00:54.270 --> 05:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:01:02.548 --> 05:01:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:06.750 --> 05:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
per well that that um that number also
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
has um you know has interesting
 
05:01:14.788 --> 05:01:14.798 align:start position:0%
comparison with what's in the um FY 26
 
05:01:18.030 --> 05:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
estimated number where you've got um
 
05:01:18.040 --> 05:01:20.190 align:start position:0%
estimated number where you've got um
estimated

05:01:20.190 --> 05:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
estimated
 
05:01:22.390 --> 05:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
31,49 yeah for the fiscal year 26
 
05:01:24.310 --> 05:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
adequacy estimate we just got copy and
 
05:01:25.990 --> 05:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
paste the previous year's number got so
 
05:01:28.230 --> 05:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
we don't do any estimate for
 
05:01:31.990 --> 05:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
that can you go up to the top row there
 
05:01:36.868 --> 05:01:36.878 align:start position:0%
um on the last sheet in that last column
 
05:01:39.390 --> 05:01:39.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking at where you have 571
 
05:01:39.400 --> 05:01:41.270 align:start position:0%
we're looking at where you have 571
th000

05:01:41.270 --> 05:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
th000
 
05:01:48.510 --> 05:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:51.548 --> 05:01:51.558 align:start position:0%
student that's a heck of an increase
 
05:01:54.070 --> 05:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
since 4,000 4
 
05:01:57.830 --> 05:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
41,000 more than 20% back in
 
05:01:59.948 --> 05:01:59.958 align:start position:0%
17 yes thank you that those would be the
 
05:02:01.868 --> 05:02:01.878 align:start position:0%
Max cost um for the students eligible
 
05:02:03.390 --> 05:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
for special education Aid so that's that
 
05:02:05.590 --> 05:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
total cost that is submitted to the
 
05:02:07.270 --> 05:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
department uh for reimbursements that
 
05:02:08.548 --> 05:02:08.558 align:start position:0%
would be the total cost for the student
 
05:02:11.788 --> 05:02:11.798 align:start position:0%
that's eligible in special education
 
05:02:13.910 --> 05:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
a can I explain that a little bit more
 
05:02:15.868 --> 05:02:15.878 align:start position:0%
for me please sure uh so all the
 
05:02:19.110 --> 05:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
students that are so for fy4 that
 
05:02:22.430 --> 05:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
$571,500 figure that's a student that
 
05:02:23.830 --> 05:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
was submitted for special education Aid
 
05:02:26.150 --> 05:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
that is a total cost that that District
 
05:02:28.628 --> 05:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
submitted to U the special education
 
05:02:30.470 --> 05:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
Bureau for reimburse for sped a so that
 
05:02:31.910 --> 05:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
that is total cost for a student that's
 
05:02:34.110 --> 05:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
eligible for for special education a is
 
05:02:35.350 --> 05:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
that minus the
 
05:02:37.788 --> 05:02:37.798 align:start position:0%
$70,000 that is the total cost it's just
 
05:02:40.590 --> 05:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
relating to one student exactly correct
 
05:02:42.990 --> 05:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
yes the high that's the most expensive
 
05:02:47.030 --> 05:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
student correct in that year in that
 
05:02:49.190 --> 05:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
yes sorry if that was confusing that
 
05:02:50.628 --> 05:02:50.638 align:start position:0%
that was the attent thank you that's the
 
05:02:54.628 --> 05:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
state cost right total or both total
 
05:02:59.830 --> 05:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:04.190 --> 05:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
okay yes that would be the total cost of
 
05:03:06.990 --> 05:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
invoices submitted that you guys
 
05:03:10.430 --> 05:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
approved just clarify eligible allowable
 
05:03:12.830 --> 05:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
cost yes which means theoretically they
 
05:03:14.868 --> 05:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
may have had some other invoices that
 
05:03:17.190 --> 05:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
you guys did not Dem in you know to
 
05:03:19.070 --> 05:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
match the IEP and so they could have
 
05:03:20.548 --> 05:03:20.558 align:start position:0%
spent more but that's just what the
 
05:03:22.750 --> 05:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
department found appropriate for that
 
05:03:27.628 --> 05:03:27.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:32.350 --> 05:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
IEP do you review all these invoices in
 
05:03:35.910 --> 05:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
detail to to decide whether that's a
 
05:03:39.030 --> 05:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
permissible cost or not expense Melissa
 
05:03:40.350 --> 05:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
white division director for learner
 
05:03:42.548 --> 05:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
support so all of the invoices are
 
05:03:44.670 --> 05:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
submitted individually we look at every
 
05:03:46.350 --> 05:03:46.360 align:start position:0%
single invoice that is submitted for
 
05:03:48.230 --> 05:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
special education Aid we go and we look
 
05:03:50.470 --> 05:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
at the students IEP and then we match up
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
to see if the costs that are being
 
05:03:53.948 --> 05:03:53.958 align:start position:0%
submitted on the invoice match what is
 
05:03:56.070 --> 05:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
in the students IEP if what is submitted
 
05:03:58.910 --> 05:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
is not in the IEP then we do not
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
reimburse them for that cost so these
 
05:04:04.150 --> 05:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
are just for the costs they could
 
05:04:06.990 --> 05:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
provide to us a number of invoices but
 
05:04:08.628 --> 05:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
we will look at only the things that are
 
05:04:11.110 --> 05:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
in the IEP and that are are eligible and
 
05:04:13.150 --> 05:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
then we reimburse based on that so this
 
05:04:15.910 --> 05:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
is an entire reimbursement basis the
 
05:04:17.788 --> 05:04:17.798 align:start position:0%
district has already incurred the cost
 
05:04:20.430 --> 05:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
and paid for them they submit them to us
 
05:04:22.948 --> 05:04:22.958 align:start position:0%
for last year we go through we spend
 
05:04:25.628 --> 05:04:25.638 align:start position:0%
several months going through all of the
 
05:04:28.708 --> 05:04:28.718 align:start position:0%
invoices and then determine okay these
 
05:04:31.510 --> 05:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
are the total Statewide expenses that
 
05:04:34.510 --> 05:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
are eligible under special education Aid
 
05:04:36.830 --> 05:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
and then we look at our amount that is
 
05:04:39.948 --> 05:04:39.958 align:start position:0%
allocated which is that 33.9 million and
 
05:04:42.470 --> 05:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
then we prate it based on that so I want
 
05:04:47.310 --> 05:04:47.320 align:start position:0%
to clarify not all leas submit for
 
05:04:49.350 --> 05:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
special education Aid so you're seeing
 
05:04:50.868 --> 05:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of questions about why
 
05:04:52.948 --> 05:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
not here why not there not all of them
 
05:04:54.830 --> 05:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
submit these are just the ones that we
 
05:04:57.750 --> 05:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
receive submissions for and that have
 
05:05:00.670 --> 05:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
eligible costs so we might receive some
 
05:05:02.030 --> 05:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
and then they're not eligible we would
 
05:05:03.390 --> 05:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
have turned around turned around and
 
05:05:06.190 --> 05:05:06.200 align:start position:0%
just um deny the request for special
 
05:05:09.750 --> 05:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
education we've heard that before but
 
05:05:12.030 --> 05:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
why are they not submitting that's a
 
05:05:13.990 --> 05:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
question that you is for the leas that's
 
05:05:16.510 --> 05:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
not something that I can
 
05:05:18.510 --> 05:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
answer isn't it possible they just don't
 
05:05:20.070 --> 05:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
have high this is just high cost
 
05:05:21.430 --> 05:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
students right we're talking that meet
 
05:05:23.030 --> 05:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
the requirements that's laid out in the
 
05:05:24.548 --> 05:05:24.558 align:start position:0%
RSA so it's certain possible that a
 
05:05:28.310 --> 05:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
number of laas just don't have may La
 
05:05:30.868 --> 05:05:30.878 align:start position:0%
local Education Agency do they all have
 
05:05:30.878 --> 05:05:31.948 align:start position:0%
local Education Agency do they all have
a

05:05:31.948 --> 05:05:31.958 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:05:33.948 --> 05:05:33.958 align:start position:0%
director um if they're operating a
 
05:05:35.750 --> 05:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
special education program then yes they
 
05:05:40.628 --> 05:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:42.670 --> 05:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
and when you've got the the Max total
 
05:05:45.708 --> 05:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
cost per student is that the Max
 
05:05:49.470 --> 05:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursable cost or that's actually all
 
05:05:52.510 --> 05:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
um approved
 
05:05:55.270 --> 05:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
costs including the costs that the
 
05:05:59.510 --> 05:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:01.910 --> 05:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
for thank you yes that would be the
 
05:06:03.590 --> 05:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
total cost that the district submitted
 
05:06:05.628 --> 05:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement to the special
 
05:06:08.548 --> 05:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
education Bureau so all costs from 0 to
 
05:06:12.150 --> 05:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
3.5 3.5 to 10 and then total cost for
 
05:06:13.830 --> 05:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
student yeah take one student yep thank
 
05:06:16.190 --> 05:06:16.200 align:start position:0%

05:06:19.990 --> 05:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
yes represent coom thank you Mr chairman
 
05:06:22.628 --> 05:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
uh do you guys also keep track of the
 
05:06:25.430 --> 05:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
costs that you um deny uh that are
 
05:06:26.990 --> 05:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
submitted but you denied you keep track
 
05:06:28.430 --> 05:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
of that number as well I don't keep
 
05:06:30.150 --> 05:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
track of that number
 
05:06:32.590 --> 05:06:32.600 align:start position:0%
no represent
 
05:06:36.030 --> 05:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you Mr chair so um if I
 
05:06:37.430 --> 05:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
recall correctly and I just want to make
 
05:06:40.030 --> 05:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
sure I remember it when we had the
 
05:06:42.230 --> 05:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
hearings for this you guys testify that
 
05:06:45.070 --> 05:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
you can review the invoices for matching
 
05:06:47.708 --> 05:06:47.718 align:start position:0%
the type of service for the IEP correct
 
05:06:50.070 --> 05:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
but you do not have any way to determine
 
05:06:51.990 --> 05:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
whether the cost is reasonable or
 
05:06:54.430 --> 05:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate or what not so if a district
 
05:06:56.788 --> 05:06:56.798 align:start position:0%
charge is 100 for a service and another
 
05:06:58.910 --> 05:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
charges a thousand both of them get
 
05:07:00.670 --> 05:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
approved as long as the service matches
 
05:07:02.510 --> 05:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
the IEP requirements correct we do not
 
05:07:04.150 --> 05:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
rate set at the department for those
 
05:07:05.830 --> 05:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
types of services and I think another
 
05:07:07.548 --> 05:07:07.558 align:start position:0%
question that had come up earlier with
 
05:07:09.670 --> 05:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
regards to you know cost of special
 
05:07:11.070 --> 05:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
education teachers and that type of
 
05:07:13.628 --> 05:07:13.638 align:start position:0%
thing and looking at case loads each
 
05:07:15.628 --> 05:07:15.638 align:start position:0%
district pays their teachers differently
 
05:07:16.510 --> 05:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
so you're going to have a special
 
05:07:18.070 --> 05:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
education teacher in one District that
 
05:07:19.430 --> 05:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
makes a certain amount and a special
 
05:07:20.868 --> 05:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
education teacher in another District
 
05:07:22.430 --> 05:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
that makes a different amount and they
 
05:07:25.190 --> 05:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
all you know have a a pay schedule based
 
05:07:27.310 --> 05:07:27.320 align:start position:0%
on their years of experience as well so
 
05:07:29.590 --> 05:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
I mean it's it's not really comparing
 
05:07:31.270 --> 05:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples because it's going to
 
05:07:35.670 --> 05:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
be varied depending on that school and
 
05:07:37.910 --> 05:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
their collective bargaining agreement
 
05:07:40.110 --> 05:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
that type of thing so if you look at the
 
05:07:41.948 --> 05:07:41.958 align:start position:0%
old form we used to have for breaking
 
05:07:45.990 --> 05:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
down what the how we arrive at the base
 
05:07:47.830 --> 05:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
cost for Education you probably haven't
 
05:07:51.750 --> 05:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
seen it but Mark has and and so if I
 
05:07:54.190 --> 05:07:54.200 align:start position:0%
take the what we appropriate in
 
05:07:56.830 --> 05:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
differentiate Aid at
 
05:08:00.628 --> 05:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
$2,184 are projecting for the next year
 
05:08:03.070 --> 05:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
and multiply that by
 
05:08:06.470 --> 05:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
30 uh 30 kids per case load it comes off
 
05:08:10.150 --> 05:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:13.150 --> 05:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
um is that basically without benefits
 
05:08:15.628 --> 05:08:15.638 align:start position:0%
the cost of a special education teacher
 
05:08:17.350 --> 05:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
around 65
 
05:08:22.470 --> 05:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:25.190 --> 05:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
district okay it's going to depend on
 
05:08:26.670 --> 05:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
the on the district it's going to depend
 
05:08:29.030 --> 05:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
upon the district is that in the as an
 
05:08:32.030 --> 05:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
average is that close so if you multiply
 
05:08:35.110 --> 05:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
it by 1.33
 
05:08:37.788 --> 05:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
33% it's going to be much higher than
 
05:08:41.070 --> 05:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
that total cost little shallow of
 
05:08:42.910 --> 05:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
$100,000 I think it's just going to
 
05:08:44.070 --> 05:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
depend on the
 
05:08:46.030 --> 05:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
district I guess I don't understand the
 
05:08:47.470 --> 05:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
question because if I'm looking at
 
05:08:48.788 --> 05:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how much I make in
 
05:08:50.470 --> 05:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
we versus how much I make in hopkington
 
05:08:51.628 --> 05:08:51.638 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a considerable
 
05:08:53.948 --> 05:08:53.958 align:start position:0%
difference between the two long we have
 
05:08:58.708 --> 05:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
to build a budget here and and and uh
 
05:09:01.150 --> 05:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
unless we do it how much each district
 
05:09:02.868 --> 05:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
should get but we don't do it like that
 
05:09:04.430 --> 05:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
we try to find an average cost of a
 
05:09:06.948 --> 05:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
teacher and go from there U or a
 
05:09:09.110 --> 05:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
principal or a guidance counselor or
 
05:09:10.948 --> 05:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
what have
 
05:09:14.990 --> 05:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
you I'm I'm arguing I'm sorry um or
 
05:09:16.990 --> 05:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
05:09:17.000 --> 05:09:19.548 align:start position:0%
trying to
explain

05:09:19.548 --> 05:09:19.558 align:start position:0%
explain
 
05:09:23.270 --> 05:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
yes so it just says as of February 2025
 
05:09:24.948 --> 05:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
the average salary for a teacher in New
 
05:09:30.868 --> 05:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:34.510 --> 05:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
$4,399 is 326 I I've got that and I've
 
05:09:36.750 --> 05:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
seen that and we've calculated that up
 
05:09:38.788 --> 05:09:38.798 align:start position:0%
my concern is though if you're talking
 
05:09:40.510 --> 05:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
about special education teacher that's
 
05:09:41.910 --> 05:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
teaching speech they're going to have to
 
05:09:44.350 --> 05:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
have a master's degree right but the
 
05:09:45.868 --> 05:09:45.878 align:start position:0%
highest is also
 
05:09:48.470 --> 05:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
61754 and that would probably
 
05:09:52.868 --> 05:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
be with longevity right I don't
 
05:09:55.390 --> 05:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
know yeah and see what I was calculating
 
05:09:56.990 --> 05:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
right here by just multiplying that
 
05:09:59.270 --> 05:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
number by 30 thinking it's 30 is a case
 
05:10:03.628 --> 05:10:03.638 align:start position:0%
load it comes out to 60 6 65.5 th000
 
05:10:08.390 --> 05:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know yeah yeah okay further
 
05:10:11.708 --> 05:10:11.718 align:start position:0%
questions yes McGuire thank thank you Mr
 
05:10:14.430 --> 05:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
chairman so the two um communities I
 
05:10:18.070 --> 05:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
like to compare are Manchester and marac
 
05:10:19.590 --> 05:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
partially because they're on the same
 
05:10:21.150 --> 05:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
page and they're very
 
05:10:25.150 --> 05:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
large um so the the different both of
 
05:10:29.350 --> 05:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
them have uh roughly 20 something perent
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
of their kids are in special ed and
 
05:10:35.590 --> 05:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
Statewide we spending uh close to
 
05:10:40.390 --> 05:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
$30,000 a kid in Special Ed but marac
 
05:10:40.400 --> 05:10:41.868 align:start position:0%
$30,000 a kid in Special Ed but marac
spends

05:10:41.868 --> 05:10:41.878 align:start position:0%
spends
 
05:10:44.948 --> 05:10:44.958 align:start position:0%
$36,000 per kid in special ed and
 
05:10:47.628 --> 05:10:47.638 align:start position:0%
Manchester spends under
 
05:10:52.868 --> 05:10:52.878 align:start position:0%
$24,000 right so marac spends 50% more
 
05:10:55.910 --> 05:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
on their typical IEP than Manchester
 
05:11:00.390 --> 05:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
does so is there so so clearly they're
 
05:11:03.868 --> 05:11:03.878 align:start position:0%
they're kind of do doing too much in my
 
05:11:08.310 --> 05:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
opinion right just from that number um
 
05:11:10.190 --> 05:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
by comparison is there anything way we
 
05:11:16.030 --> 05:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
can help marac act more like
 
05:11:18.230 --> 05:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
Manchester these are all different kids
 
05:11:20.030 --> 05:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
with different needs and these are
 
05:11:21.510 --> 05:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
different programs that have come up
 
05:11:23.030 --> 05:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
with determinations on how they're going
 
05:11:25.750 --> 05:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
to meet the children's needs so I I
 
05:11:27.548 --> 05:11:27.558 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of questions about
 
05:11:29.750 --> 05:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
the granularity of services and the cost
 
05:11:31.548 --> 05:11:31.558 align:start position:0%
of those services and that's just not
 
05:11:34.270 --> 05:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
something that we can do okay at the
 
05:11:37.590 --> 05:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
department may I follow up M so but the
 
05:11:39.548 --> 05:11:39.558 align:start position:0%
problem is in Manchester we're talking
 
05:11:42.990 --> 05:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
about 2900 kids and in marac I'm talking
 
05:11:46.788 --> 05:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
about 800 kids right so the average is
 
05:11:48.270 --> 05:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
going to be pretty
 
05:11:50.670 --> 05:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
good do you see what I mean I mean it's
 
05:11:52.868 --> 05:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
not like two or three kids and yes this
 
05:11:55.390 --> 05:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
could be a really high-end kit these are
 
05:11:59.230 --> 05:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
these are going to be the averages is is
 
05:12:02.270 --> 05:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
typical is is more accurate I guess
 
05:12:06.030 --> 05:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:08.270 --> 05:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
involved I'm not sure what the question
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
is so so when I saying is do we have
 
05:12:15.510 --> 05:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
any do you do any instruction any
 
05:12:20.470 --> 05:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
guidance any um auditing any control to
 
05:12:22.628 --> 05:12:22.638 align:start position:0%
to look at this number and say
 
05:12:27.990 --> 05:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:31.628 --> 05:12:31.638 align:start position:0%
much again we we don't rate set so we
 
05:12:35.868 --> 05:12:35.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say anything about the cost of
 
05:12:39.470 --> 05:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
how a district is choosing to spend
 
05:12:41.150 --> 05:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
their on their special education
 
05:12:43.150 --> 05:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
services we do in we go in and do
 
05:12:44.548 --> 05:12:44.558 align:start position:0%
monitoring and make sure they're meeting
 
05:12:47.590 --> 05:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
their requirements set aside in federal
 
05:12:50.628 --> 05:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
law and in state law but no we don't go
 
05:12:53.430 --> 05:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
in and tell them how they should spend
 
05:12:55.390 --> 05:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
those funds that's a local level
 
05:12:57.310 --> 05:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
determination I think that's a question
 
05:13:02.590 --> 05:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:06.948 --> 05:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
Ed yes yeah AR aren't those aren't isn't
 
05:13:09.670 --> 05:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
the IEP I mean you you I think you
 
05:13:12.350 --> 05:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
testified earlier that that you qualify
 
05:13:15.110 --> 05:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
the costs based on what's in the I we
 
05:13:17.230 --> 05:13:17.240 align:start position:0%
don't yes we just determine if the costs
 
05:13:20.310 --> 05:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
are allowable so if the service was put
 
05:13:21.868 --> 05:13:21.878 align:start position:0%
in for speech services let's say and
 
05:13:23.270 --> 05:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
they're asking for reimbursement for
 
05:13:25.110 --> 05:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
speech services but speech services are
 
05:13:27.670 --> 05:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
not in the IEP we will not reimburse so
 
05:13:29.390 --> 05:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the IEP correct and
 
05:13:32.270 --> 05:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
the IEP was prepared by the IEP team at
 
05:13:35.110 --> 05:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
the local level so it's not just the Lea
 
05:13:38.030 --> 05:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
it's actually it involves a team of
 
05:13:40.270 --> 05:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
people right so so you're you're correct
 
05:13:42.390 --> 05:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
in saying that the decision is made at
 
05:13:44.948 --> 05:13:44.958 align:start position:0%
the local level but it's actually made
 
05:13:47.910 --> 05:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
at the local level by an i team not the
 
05:13:50.110 --> 05:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
school board or the building principle
 
05:13:52.230 --> 05:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
correct but when you say you're looking
 
05:13:54.230 --> 05:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
at the IEP you're just looking to see if
 
05:13:56.190 --> 05:13:56.200 align:start position:0%
there's a speech IEP you're not looking
 
05:14:00.030 --> 05:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
down in the the grains of that IEP are
 
05:14:03.070 --> 05:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
you like like for example the state of
 
05:14:07.470 --> 05:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
Arkansas audits one in 10 IEPs to ensure
 
05:14:11.390 --> 05:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
what they're billing out is
 
05:14:13.390 --> 05:14:13.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate when we talked to them on
 
05:14:15.110 --> 05:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
the horn here what two weeks ago or
 
05:14:17.030 --> 05:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
three weeks ago we talked to the
 
05:14:19.310 --> 05:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
director special ed down there and that
 
05:14:20.948 --> 05:14:20.958 align:start position:0%
program down there when they're looking
 
05:14:22.390 --> 05:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
at these
 
05:14:25.788 --> 05:14:25.798 align:start position:0%
costs they ensure that they audit one in
 
05:14:29.270 --> 05:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
every 10 IEPs in that state I know
 
05:14:32.110 --> 05:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
that's pretty high bar for you guys to
 
05:14:35.430 --> 05:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
do here with the staff you have but yes
 
05:14:38.350 --> 05:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
State funds 0.25 FTE for special
 
05:14:40.670 --> 05:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
education staff at the department so
 
05:14:42.310 --> 05:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
when you say you look at the IPS you
 
05:14:44.708 --> 05:14:44.718 align:start position:0%
look to see if there is an IP like
 
05:14:47.110 --> 05:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
emotionally handicapped or or
 
05:14:51.230 --> 05:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
or uh physically handicap I hire two
 
05:14:53.708 --> 05:14:53.718 align:start position:0%
seasonal part-time staff members that
 
05:14:56.070 --> 05:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
come on just to review those special
 
05:14:59.390 --> 05:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
education Aid invoices and they look at
 
05:15:01.750 --> 05:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
is it in the IEP they're not doing an
 
05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
analysis of whether it's appropriate for
 
05:15:05.390 --> 05:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
the student or if the services are
 
05:15:07.190 --> 05:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate they're not looking at that
 
05:15:10.230 --> 05:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
piece of it they're just looking at is
 
05:15:13.910 --> 05:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
it in the IEP and then can we reimburse
 
05:15:15.990 --> 05:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
for that that's do you look actually at
 
05:15:18.470 --> 05:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
the IEP we look at the IEP how do you
 
05:15:24.350 --> 05:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:24.360 --> 05:15:26.030 align:start position:0%
 
system

05:15:26.030 --> 05:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:15:28.868 --> 05:15:28.878 align:start position:0%
okay and no there's a hand over
 
05:15:32.150 --> 05:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um I just wanted to follow
 
05:15:34.830 --> 05:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
up on representative Maguire's question
 
05:15:37.830 --> 05:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
and you had mentioned earlier every
 
05:15:39.868 --> 05:15:39.878 align:start position:0%
student is different and every and their
 
05:15:42.470 --> 05:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
needs are all different and so if it's
 
05:15:44.670 --> 05:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
marac Manchester kind of
 
05:15:47.830 --> 05:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
situation I would think that that
 
05:15:47.840 --> 05:15:49.390 align:start position:0%
situation I would think that that
student

05:15:49.390 --> 05:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
student
 
05:15:52.470 --> 05:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
whose um the cost associated with
 
05:15:54.590 --> 05:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
educating that student was
 
05:15:57.310 --> 05:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
$571,000 could have been in the Marram
 
05:15:59.868 --> 05:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
district is that accurate to say so it
 
05:16:01.590 --> 05:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
could just change the numbers pretty
 
05:16:04.628 --> 05:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
drastically correct okay thank
 
05:16:04.638 --> 05:16:06.270 align:start position:0%
drastically correct okay thank
you

05:16:06.270 --> 05:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:16:09.590 --> 05:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair you want earlier
 
05:16:11.708 --> 05:16:11.718 align:start position:0%
that you don't trate set we are by by
 
05:16:14.868 --> 05:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
now we all get it if hypothetically we
 
05:16:17.110 --> 05:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
would like to start going down that road
 
05:16:18.948 --> 05:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
where we would ask the Department of
 
05:16:22.590 --> 05:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
Education to start putting together say
 
05:16:25.430 --> 05:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
county level appropriate you know levels
 
05:16:27.750 --> 05:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
of reimbursement for certain
 
05:16:30.190 --> 05:16:30.200 align:start position:0%
Services can you tell me a bit about
 
05:16:32.270 --> 05:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
what type of staff and resources
 
05:16:34.590 --> 05:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
timeline complexity of the project is
 
05:16:36.948 --> 05:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
that something that we could you know if
 
05:16:39.670 --> 05:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
we suggested that you go down that path
 
05:16:41.670 --> 05:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
what would it take in both time and
 
05:16:43.590 --> 05:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
resources I think I would need time to
 
05:16:46.788 --> 05:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
do an analysis to see what that would
 
05:16:49.548 --> 05:16:49.558 align:start position:0%
entail before just answering it off the
 
05:16:49.558 --> 05:16:50.788 align:start position:0%
entail before just answering it off the
cuff

05:16:50.788 --> 05:16:50.798 align:start position:0%
cuff
 
05:16:53.110 --> 05:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
here I'd appreciate if you would because
 
05:16:55.030 --> 05:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
I can guarantee more questions will be
 
05:16:56.310 --> 05:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
asked on that
 
05:16:59.708 --> 05:16:59.718 align:start position:0%
later McGuire yeah so we have more deta
 
05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
more detail in front of us here and it's
 
05:17:04.910 --> 05:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
not what you just described it's all in
 
05:17:08.470 --> 05:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
the the 0 to 70k range that's the where
 
05:17:11.110 --> 05:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
the big differences between Manchester
 
05:17:14.310 --> 05:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
and marac the higher end range they're
 
05:17:16.830 --> 05:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
not out of line with each other in
 
05:17:20.270 --> 05:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
anyway it's it's the basic um lower
 
05:17:20.280 --> 05:17:21.190 align:start position:0%
anyway it's it's the basic um lower
level

05:17:21.190 --> 05:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:17:24.628 --> 05:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:27.230 --> 05:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
you so what would happen if we reduce
 
05:17:30.670 --> 05:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
that from zero from 70 down lower so
 
05:17:32.830 --> 05:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
that the state starts cutting in a
 
05:17:34.788 --> 05:17:34.798 align:start position:0%
little earlier in the game
 
05:17:37.150 --> 05:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
here just going back to what you
 
05:17:39.470 --> 05:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned this is what they submitted
 
05:17:41.548 --> 05:17:41.558 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement so it might very well
 
05:17:43.548 --> 05:17:43.558 align:start position:0%
be that the special education Aid that
 
05:17:45.230 --> 05:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
they submitted for I mean it may not
 
05:17:47.830 --> 05:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
fall into there we can just go by what
 
05:17:50.150 --> 05:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
we've received that's the only data we
 
05:17:50.160 --> 05:17:51.270 align:start position:0%
we've received that's the only data we
really

05:17:51.270 --> 05:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:17:55.830 --> 05:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
have I think what we have here is more
 
05:17:58.390 --> 05:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
complete I'm sorry
 
05:18:01.750 --> 05:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative um lad could you oh my
 
05:18:04.150 --> 05:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
question was we have some bills which
 
05:18:06.510 --> 05:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
are going the way we've done before from
 
05:18:08.150 --> 05:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
three and a half times down to two and a
 
05:18:09.310 --> 05:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
half times
 
05:18:09.320 --> 05:18:10.310 align:start position:0%
half times
or

05:18:10.310 --> 05:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:18:10.320 --> 05:18:12.110 align:start position:0%
or
lower

05:18:12.110 --> 05:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
lower
 
05:18:14.708 --> 05:18:14.718 align:start position:0%
um that's where the majority of our
 
05:18:18.830 --> 05:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
special education IEPs are and so it
 
05:18:20.310 --> 05:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
would take some of the burden off the
 
05:18:23.670 --> 05:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
local and put more on state have you
 
05:18:26.190 --> 05:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
looked into that as far as what would
 
05:18:29.150 --> 05:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
happen if we did change and move that
 
05:18:32.030 --> 05:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
back off maybe you know instead of two
 
05:18:34.350 --> 05:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
and a half times to or three and a half
 
05:18:36.390 --> 05:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
to two and a half times per pupil cost
 
05:18:38.788 --> 05:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
yes um there have been several bills
 
05:18:40.510 --> 05:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
introduced the past several years that
 
05:18:42.070 --> 05:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
have done that and we provided fiscal
 
05:18:43.708 --> 05:18:43.718 align:start position:0%
notes that show what that would look
 
05:18:46.548 --> 05:18:46.558 align:start position:0%
like so I can dig up the old fiscal
 
05:18:50.030 --> 05:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
notes and provide that if needed thank
 
05:18:50.040 --> 05:18:51.868 align:start position:0%
notes and provide that if needed thank
you

05:18:51.868 --> 05:18:51.878 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:18:56.390 --> 05:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um may I ask how would you
 
05:18:58.708 --> 05:18:58.718 align:start position:0%
determine the amounts in those fiscal
 
05:19:01.190 --> 05:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
notes because in asking questions you
 
05:19:04.390 --> 05:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
know in previous hearings um we
 
05:19:05.990 --> 05:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
understand that all the data you have
 
05:19:08.990 --> 05:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
are for the you know catastrophic
 
05:19:11.830 --> 05:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
students where the school district sees
 
05:19:13.270 --> 05:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
that they are reaching the threshold to
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
start collecting so they will give you
 
05:19:17.708 --> 05:19:17.718 align:start position:0%
all the invoices for that
 
05:19:20.110 --> 05:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
student do you have any data for the
 
05:19:22.390 --> 05:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
students that are under that threshold I
 
05:19:23.788 --> 05:19:23.798 align:start position:0%
have to go back and look through because
 
05:19:27.150 --> 05:19:27.160 align:start position:0%
we have done um estimates in the past on
 
05:19:30.628 --> 05:19:30.638 align:start position:0%
um that I think it there was a maybe two
 
05:19:32.350 --> 05:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
years ago there was a 2 and a half% and
 
05:19:33.708 --> 05:19:33.718 align:start position:0%
there was a one and a half% so we
 
05:19:36.030 --> 05:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
projected it at several different so
 
05:19:37.310 --> 05:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
basically when you present those
 
05:19:38.948 --> 05:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
estimates I would really appreciate if
 
05:19:40.868 --> 05:19:40.878 align:start position:0%
it include some information on the
 
05:19:42.628 --> 05:19:42.638 align:start position:0%
methodology and assumptions used to come
 
05:19:45.150 --> 05:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
up with them so we understand because
 
05:19:47.110 --> 05:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
you know a model can have any number of
 
05:19:49.548 --> 05:19:49.558 align:start position:0%
assumptions that are required but in
 
05:19:51.548 --> 05:19:51.558 align:start position:0%
order to understand the model we have to
 
05:19:53.590 --> 05:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
understand what the you know ballpark
 
05:19:55.788 --> 05:19:55.798 align:start position:0%
numbers you have to put in that word
 
05:19:58.150 --> 05:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you can do that Mr chair yes if I
 
05:20:00.310 --> 05:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
could just tag on to that that that's a
 
05:20:02.350 --> 05:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
point I remember we we definitely talked
 
05:20:04.750 --> 05:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
about a couple years ago because uh
 
05:20:08.390 --> 05:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
because the pool at 2.5 is clearly going
 
05:20:10.670 --> 05:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
to be a lot larger yes than the pool at
 
05:20:13.310 --> 05:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
3.5 and then it will increasingly
 
05:20:16.350 --> 05:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
tighten as you as you go up so so being
 
05:20:20.628 --> 05:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
able to be a look at um at a student
 
05:20:23.310 --> 05:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
that maybe stopped at
 
05:20:26.788 --> 05:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
2.6 you know and and and and um and that
 
05:20:29.190 --> 05:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
may be you know something that we're not
 
05:20:30.990 --> 05:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
getting from the uh the districts
 
05:20:33.670 --> 05:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
because they weren't even close to um to
 
05:20:35.948 --> 05:20:35.958 align:start position:0%
coming to the the 3.5
 
05:20:39.110 --> 05:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
threshold and and I think we had we had
 
05:20:42.628 --> 05:20:42.638 align:start position:0%
talked about this um Mr chair couple of
 
05:20:44.310 --> 05:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
years ago well we talked a couple years
 
05:20:46.590 --> 05:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
ago and we talked about it this year
 
05:20:47.830 --> 05:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
where we're looking at these other
 
05:20:50.708 --> 05:20:50.718 align:start position:0%
states where the locals have to pay the
 
05:20:53.030 --> 05:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
first 15 grand no no I'm talking about
 
05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
how we do the how we do the data
 
05:20:57.590 --> 05:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
analysis oh how we do we can we can we
 
05:20:59.708 --> 05:20:59.718 align:start position:0%
can do I think reasonable
 
05:21:03.470 --> 05:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
projections um you know to what what
 
05:21:05.788 --> 05:21:05.798 align:start position:0%
lower threshold points you know what
 
05:21:07.750 --> 05:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
what three looks like what 2.5 looks
 
05:21:10.190 --> 05:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
like what two looks like uh without just
 
05:21:12.190 --> 05:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
working from the the the base of
 
05:21:16.070 --> 05:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
invoices you know we've got now so so
 
05:21:18.310 --> 05:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
thanks looking at previous year fiscal
 
05:21:20.030 --> 05:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
notes and it looks like we did not make
 
05:21:22.230 --> 05:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
an attempt to come up with an yeah you
 
05:21:25.030 --> 05:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
said you couldn't do it yeah that's why
 
05:21:26.548 --> 05:21:26.558 align:start position:0%
we never got it we were just told it's
 
05:21:28.190 --> 05:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
not available
 
05:21:32.190 --> 05:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
information uh so it's amazing reps and
 
05:21:35.070 --> 05:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you excuse
 
05:21:38.750 --> 05:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
me so you told us that there's not
 
05:21:41.510 --> 05:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
setting from doe to districts for how
 
05:21:44.430 --> 05:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
they Implement their special services
 
05:21:46.910 --> 05:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
correct is their rate setting related to
 
05:21:48.470 --> 05:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
out of District placements that the
 
05:21:50.110 --> 05:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
state is paying
 
05:21:55.868 --> 05:21:55.878 align:start position:0%
for um I believe that I would want to go
 
05:21:57.350 --> 05:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
back and take a look at that and
 
05:21:58.948 --> 05:21:58.958 align:start position:0%
actually ask Becky for debt but I'm
 
05:22:00.788 --> 05:22:00.798 align:start position:0%
pretty sure there's a specific rate
 
05:22:03.788 --> 05:22:03.798 align:start position:0%
setting for instate placements but not
 
05:22:06.548 --> 05:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
for out of District instate placements
 
05:22:08.510 --> 05:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at facility approv
 
05:22:12.070 --> 05:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
approval but not out of
 
05:22:14.708 --> 05:22:14.718 align:start position:0%
state so but I want to go back and look
 
05:22:16.548 --> 05:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
just to see specifically because I'm
 
05:22:19.628 --> 05:22:19.638 align:start position:0%
pretty sure they submit um the facility
 
05:22:19.638 --> 05:22:20.590 align:start position:0%
pretty sure they submit um the facility
will

05:22:20.590 --> 05:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
will
 
05:22:23.070 --> 05:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
submit a lot of their financial data and
 
05:22:24.628 --> 05:22:24.638 align:start position:0%
then we're able to look at rate setting
 
05:22:26.430 --> 05:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
based on that and then do an analysis
 
05:22:29.390 --> 05:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
across several but it's the out of state
 
05:22:32.230 --> 05:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
um placements that tend to not have that
 
05:22:35.590 --> 05:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
in place and then that's where um we see
 
05:22:36.868 --> 05:22:36.878 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
05:22:40.590 --> 05:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
costs um are are much different compared
 
05:22:42.110 --> 05:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
to inate
 
05:22:45.110 --> 05:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
placements thank
 
05:22:48.190 --> 05:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
you represent papovich if I may just
 
05:22:50.590 --> 05:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
quickly again repeat a similar request
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
when you provide that data on the rate
 
05:22:55.390 --> 05:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
setting process if you could be prepared
 
05:22:57.390 --> 05:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
to explain you know in a bit of detail
 
05:23:00.670 --> 05:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
how the process works right you know
 
05:23:02.510 --> 05:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's nice to know it's generally about
 
05:23:04.510 --> 05:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
the financials but what do you look at
 
05:23:05.750 --> 05:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know how do you determine their
 
05:23:07.510 --> 05:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
costs are reasonable and so on and so
 
05:23:08.990 --> 05:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
forth cuz there there's always a
 
05:23:10.628 --> 05:23:10.638 align:start position:0%
question between what's an appropriate
 
05:23:13.310 --> 05:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
rate and what's an actual rate and it
 
05:23:15.270 --> 05:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
can get really complicated and all of
 
05:23:17.670 --> 05:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
this is on our website so all of the the
 
05:23:20.230 --> 05:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
rate setting is placed on the website
 
05:23:22.548 --> 05:23:22.558 align:start position:0%
for anyone to look
 
05:23:25.070 --> 05:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
at have you had any recent discussions
 
05:23:27.788 --> 05:23:27.798 align:start position:0%
with HHS regarding the cost that
 
05:23:31.150 --> 05:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is taking on these out of state
 
05:23:33.430 --> 05:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
placements uh and where that starts and
 
05:23:38.590 --> 05:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
stops in terms of where our costs as the
 
05:23:42.510 --> 05:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:48.230 --> 05:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
stop so the out of District placements
 
05:23:50.230 --> 05:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
that are court ordered placements or
 
05:23:52.628 --> 05:23:52.638 align:start position:0%
episodes of treatments are done by
 
05:23:55.628 --> 05:23:55.638 align:start position:0%
DHHS if they're not done by DHHS then
 
05:23:57.390 --> 05:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
that would be the district making the
 
05:23:59.190 --> 05:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
determination on where the student gets
 
05:24:02.910 --> 05:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
placed if they're not done by DHHS what
 
05:24:05.110 --> 05:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
are some of those Services which
 
05:24:08.510 --> 05:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
are does it have to relate to the IEP
 
05:24:11.750 --> 05:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
episodes of treatment and the um court
 
05:24:13.590 --> 05:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
ordered placements and so the district
 
05:24:16.390 --> 05:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
will cover the costs of the educational
 
05:24:19.430 --> 05:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
portion of that as in the
 
05:24:23.910 --> 05:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
IEP but if let's say an episode of
 
05:24:27.070 --> 05:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
treatment student is placed and it's not
 
05:24:29.430 --> 05:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
in the students's I AP then those costs
 
05:24:29.440 --> 05:24:30.350 align:start position:0%
in the students's I AP then those costs
would

05:24:30.350 --> 05:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:24:32.310 --> 05:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
not and the
 
05:24:34.510 --> 05:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh associated with that
 
05:24:37.190 --> 05:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
out of state is paid by whom if it's in
 
05:24:40.430 --> 05:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
the IEP it would would be paid by the
 
05:24:42.788 --> 05:24:42.798 align:start position:0%
district and then they could that could
 
05:24:45.070 --> 05:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
be a cost that they could reimburse for
 
05:24:46.948 --> 05:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
special education Aid it would be an
 
05:24:46.958 --> 05:24:48.230 align:start position:0%
special education Aid it would be an
eligible

05:24:48.230 --> 05:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
05:24:50.830 --> 05:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
cost the quarter to placements in the uh
 
05:24:53.590 --> 05:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
episodes of treatment transportation is
 
05:24:55.830 --> 05:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
I think included in the cost are there
 
05:24:57.868 --> 05:24:57.878 align:start position:0%
any other questions here on the special
 
05:25:00.948 --> 05:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
education component here yes represent
 
05:25:04.030 --> 05:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
magu thank you is your system have
 
05:25:07.070 --> 05:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
enough granularity such that
 
05:25:11.470 --> 05:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
um the I says rather than just need
 
05:25:14.430 --> 05:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
speech therapy it says needs two hours
 
05:25:17.510 --> 05:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
of speech therapy per week or 10 hours a
 
05:25:20.510 --> 05:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
week or something like that and does
 
05:25:23.390 --> 05:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
your system know that that for a
 
05:25:26.070 --> 05:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
particular Community the average speech
 
05:25:30.070 --> 05:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
therapist hour is $100 or $200 or
 
05:25:33.868 --> 05:25:33.878 align:start position:0%
something like that no no can't you
 
05:25:35.750 --> 05:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
can't sort of tease that out that that's
 
05:25:38.868 --> 05:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
not available no okay if a district
 
05:25:41.910 --> 05:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
hires a speech therapist there's the
 
05:25:44.628 --> 05:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
cost for that speech therapist that is
 
05:25:46.788 --> 05:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
set by The District's collective
 
05:25:48.948 --> 05:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement if they're not able
 
05:25:51.110 --> 05:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
to get one they might have to contract
 
05:25:53.310 --> 05:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
that work out so then the cost is going
 
05:25:56.788 --> 05:25:56.798 align:start position:0%
to be different so it because it varies
 
05:25:59.510 --> 05:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
across the state across who they're able
 
05:26:02.110 --> 05:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
to actually um procure to give the
 
05:26:04.230 --> 05:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
services to the students it just there's
 
05:26:07.670 --> 05:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
so much variance but given collect that
 
05:26:07.680 --> 05:26:08.868 align:start position:0%
so much variance but given collect that
data

05:26:08.868 --> 05:26:08.878 align:start position:0%
data
 
05:26:11.868 --> 05:26:11.878 align:start position:0%
and the other part too is yes if a
 
05:26:14.350 --> 05:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
student is receiving special education
 
05:26:17.150 --> 05:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
um speech services and maybe there twice
 
05:26:19.948 --> 05:26:19.958 align:start position:0%
a week at you know 30 minutes it's in a
 
05:26:22.350 --> 05:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
narrative format there's not some way
 
05:26:24.430 --> 05:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
for us to capture that and then do some
 
05:26:26.868 --> 05:26:26.878 align:start position:0%
sort of analysis it's just written in
 
05:26:29.310 --> 05:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
The Narrative of the students IEP so
 
05:26:30.750 --> 05:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
that's why it's a lot of work for the
 
05:26:33.510 --> 05:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
person to go and actually look at the
 
05:26:35.628 --> 05:26:35.638 align:start position:0%
bill or the invoice and then look at the
 
05:26:37.030 --> 05:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
IEP because they're reading it in a
 
05:26:37.040 --> 05:26:40.110 align:start position:0%
IEP because they're reading it in a
narrative

05:26:40.110 --> 05:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:43.110 --> 05:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
format how is the billable hour
 
05:26:43.120 --> 05:26:44.948 align:start position:0%
format how is the billable hour
established

05:26:44.948 --> 05:26:44.958 align:start position:0%
established
 
05:26:48.750 --> 05:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
for a student which is re receiving some
 
05:26:50.548 --> 05:26:50.558 align:start position:0%
Medicaid support that that's been
 
05:26:52.868 --> 05:26:52.878 align:start position:0%
referred by the school nurse or by a
 
05:26:55.030 --> 05:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
person that's qualified to do that with
 
05:26:58.230 --> 05:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid even some of our age three
 
05:27:01.390 --> 05:27:01.400 align:start position:0%
through five bracket and I'm just trying
 
05:27:03.150 --> 05:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
to find out yes there's such a thing as
 
05:27:04.990 --> 05:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
ailable hour for
 
05:27:08.670 --> 05:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
Audiology that we could find in in start
 
05:27:10.948 --> 05:27:10.958 align:start position:0%
using as a measure of cost for an hour's
 
05:27:14.670 --> 05:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
worth of work I would think DHHS might
 
05:27:16.750 --> 05:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
be able to provide that information we
 
05:27:17.990 --> 05:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have that because at the
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education we don't deal
 
05:27:22.670 --> 05:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
with Medicaid at all so any of the
 
05:27:26.510 --> 05:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that the um district is trying
 
05:27:28.510 --> 05:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
to seek reimbursement for they go
 
05:27:30.510 --> 05:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
through a separate system and they um
 
05:27:32.990 --> 05:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
handle that internally themselves we
 
05:27:34.590 --> 05:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
don't have any involvement with that
 
05:27:37.150 --> 05:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
piece of it further questions so special
 
05:27:39.670 --> 05:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
education yes G and
 
05:27:42.548 --> 05:27:42.558 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair so I
 
05:27:45.310 --> 05:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
was wondering I want to go back to the
 
05:27:48.510 --> 05:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
um that the row with the Max total cost
 
05:27:51.070 --> 05:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
per student and I I get it this is for
 
05:27:53.430 --> 05:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
the the of of all the students that were
 
05:27:55.390 --> 05:27:55.400 align:start position:0%
involved in the reimbursement request
 
05:27:59.190 --> 05:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
this is the one that had the highest um
 
05:28:01.868 --> 05:28:01.878 align:start position:0%
um cost associated with them and I was
 
05:28:03.788 --> 05:28:03.798 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could talk a little bit
 
05:28:07.070 --> 05:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
about what sort of services go into
 
05:28:10.830 --> 05:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
driving a cost of to 57 almost
 
05:28:13.628 --> 05:28:13.638 align:start position:0%
$572,000 uh for a for a single student
 
05:28:15.788 --> 05:28:15.798 align:start position:0%
and maybe talk a little bit about how
 
05:28:19.110 --> 05:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
that cost I mean it you know did it you
 
05:28:20.750 --> 05:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
know was it most of the students and
 
05:28:22.750 --> 05:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
then and then one or was there sort of
 
05:28:26.350 --> 05:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
like this taper that that went like the
 
05:28:28.990 --> 05:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
the the second the second to the maximum
 
05:28:30.910 --> 05:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
cost was
 
05:28:33.030 --> 05:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
$570,000 I'm just wonder if you could
 
05:28:34.868 --> 05:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about the services
 
05:28:39.150 --> 05:28:39.160 align:start position:0%
that go into that and you know know how
 
05:28:42.590 --> 05:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
many students across the state are are
 
05:28:45.628 --> 05:28:45.638 align:start position:0%
in that ballpark I do appreciate the
 
05:28:47.548 --> 05:28:47.558 align:start position:0%
question I can't speak to the specifics
 
05:28:49.350 --> 05:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
of it because I didn't look at the IEP
 
05:28:51.548 --> 05:28:51.558 align:start position:0%
myself so I can't say what the services
 
05:28:54.390 --> 05:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
or what the student is receiving I I
 
05:28:56.230 --> 05:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
can't speak to that at all and the cost
 
05:28:58.708 --> 05:28:58.718 align:start position:0%
associated with that I apologize but I
 
05:29:01.670 --> 05:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
can't because I don't
 
05:29:01.680 --> 05:29:03.190 align:start position:0%
can't because I don't
know

05:29:03.190 --> 05:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:29:08.510 --> 05:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay yes represent Brown thank you
 
05:29:11.548 --> 05:29:11.558 align:start position:0%
last work session uh we were told that
 
05:29:15.070 --> 05:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
the submitted invoices may not detail or
 
05:29:17.270 --> 05:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
differentiate travel time versus a
 
05:29:19.350 --> 05:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
service time for a specialist that comes
 
05:29:22.470 --> 05:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
in is there any way the invoices for the
 
05:29:25.510 --> 05:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
IEPs and or or the IEPs themselves can
 
05:29:27.270 --> 05:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
be more specific in terms of the
 
05:29:31.350 --> 05:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
breakdown of um the time involved for
 
05:29:31.360 --> 05:29:32.868 align:start position:0%
breakdown of um the time involved for
these

05:29:32.868 --> 05:29:32.878 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:29:36.310 --> 05:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
services so I think the time involved
 
05:29:37.708 --> 05:29:37.718 align:start position:0%
getting back to the previous example
 
05:29:40.390 --> 05:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
that we just talked about speech therapy
 
05:29:42.548 --> 05:29:42.558 align:start position:0%
twice a week 30 minutes like that
 
05:29:44.030 --> 05:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
information will be listed in The
 
05:29:46.868 --> 05:29:46.878 align:start position:0%
Narrative of the IEP but as far as the
 
05:29:49.670 --> 05:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
travel time the travel time may not be
 
05:29:51.910 --> 05:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
in the I AP necessarily but it would be
 
05:29:54.030 --> 05:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
on the invoice re receed so if we were
 
05:29:56.230 --> 05:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursing for mileage we would have to
 
05:29:59.270 --> 05:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
see from that Transportation Company
 
05:30:01.910 --> 05:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
dates of services where the student was
 
05:30:04.110 --> 05:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
provided transportations that would have
 
05:30:07.948 --> 05:30:07.958 align:start position:0%
to be on there um some of them if it's
 
05:30:09.708 --> 05:30:09.718 align:start position:0%
urement for mileage that would have to
 
05:30:11.788 --> 05:30:11.798 align:start position:0%
be on there but if they have a set rate
 
05:30:14.070 --> 05:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
per trip and then it would show like
 
05:30:17.510 --> 05:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
location if it's from the school to um
 
05:30:19.150 --> 05:30:19.160 align:start position:0%
maybe where services are being provided
 
05:30:21.470 --> 05:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
or something like that that is detailed
 
05:30:24.788 --> 05:30:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:24.798 --> 05:30:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
receive

05:30:27.830 --> 05:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:30.910 --> 05:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
yes but that wouldn't be entered into
 
05:30:32.548 --> 05:30:32.558 align:start position:0%
necessarily like we would look at that
 
05:30:33.670 --> 05:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
and we would say that that was an
 
05:30:35.788 --> 05:30:35.798 align:start position:0%
allowable cost but we're not recording
 
05:30:38.070 --> 05:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
that somewhere we wouldn't re-recording
 
05:30:41.150 --> 05:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
mileage or Transportation or breaking it
 
05:30:44.788 --> 05:30:44.798 align:start position:0%
down and um on the single sheet where it
 
05:30:48.350 --> 05:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
says Statewide count out of District
 
05:30:51.270 --> 05:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
this is historical cost Trends by age
 
05:30:54.830 --> 05:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
group um lower right corner it says we
 
05:30:54.840 --> 05:30:56.270 align:start position:0%
group um lower right corner it says we
had

05:30:56.270 --> 05:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
had
 
05:31:00.548 --> 05:31:00.558 align:start position:0%
1464 students out of District how many
 
05:31:03.788 --> 05:31:03.798 align:start position:0%
of those were out of state do we know
 
05:31:07.030 --> 05:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
and how and by state could we find out
 
05:31:09.310 --> 05:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
whether it was massachus sit
 
05:31:11.708 --> 05:31:11.718 align:start position:0%
main what states those
 
05:31:14.070 --> 05:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
were thank you uh I don't have that
 
05:31:15.628 --> 05:31:15.638 align:start position:0%
prepared unfortunately at this moment we
 
05:31:20.190 --> 05:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
can uh gather that so the 1464 figure we
 
05:31:23.868 --> 05:31:23.878 align:start position:0%
could look at to determine how many of
 
05:31:25.390 --> 05:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
those are within out of District but
 
05:31:26.590 --> 05:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
within State and then how many are out
 
05:31:28.548 --> 05:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
of state and by state we can we can look
 
05:31:28.558 --> 05:31:30.110 align:start position:0%
of state and by state we can we can look
into

05:31:30.110 --> 05:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
into
 
05:31:32.470 --> 05:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
that are there any other questions for
 
05:31:32.480 --> 05:31:34.910 align:start position:0%
that are there any other questions for
the

05:31:34.910 --> 05:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:39.590 --> 05:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
Department I think we're done with the
 
05:31:43.990 --> 05:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:49.230 --> 05:31:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:51.750 --> 05:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
so obviously we're not taking any action
 
05:31:53.548 --> 05:31:53.558 align:start position:0%
any of this today but we need to be
 
05:31:56.350 --> 05:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
starting to filter this down I guess
 
05:32:00.708 --> 05:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
looking at the formulas for gluing This
 
05:32:03.390 --> 05:32:03.400 align:start position:0%
Together uh what's our funding formula
 
05:32:07.070 --> 05:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
going to look like um uh how are we
 
05:32:09.628 --> 05:32:09.638 align:start position:0%
going to address special education Aid I
 
05:32:11.190 --> 05:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
I think these are really two big
 
05:32:14.030 --> 05:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
elephants in the room here that we need
 
05:32:17.270 --> 05:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
to now get down to yeah can I can I ask
 
05:32:19.788 --> 05:32:19.798 align:start position:0%
a question what what are our takeaways
 
05:32:22.270 --> 05:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
from from the last hour and a half of
 
05:32:24.430 --> 05:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
looking at this what what are the things
 
05:32:29.830 --> 05:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
that are really jumping off this that we
 
05:32:32.750 --> 05:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
I represents billsburg yeah I mean I'll
 
05:32:35.868 --> 05:32:35.878 align:start position:0%
volunteer a few observations and I think
 
05:32:37.510 --> 05:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
they're just confirming what most of us
 
05:32:39.750 --> 05:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
already this really know if we don't
 
05:32:43.150 --> 05:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
specifically quantifiably know it but uh
 
05:32:45.910 --> 05:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide student enrollment since 17
 
05:32:48.548 --> 05:32:48.558 align:start position:0%
has declined from
 
05:32:51.310 --> 05:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
184,000 to about
 
05:32:54.270 --> 05:32:54.280 align:start position:0%
169,000 simultaneously the student count
 
05:32:59.310 --> 05:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:02.990 --> 05:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
323646 717 so we've got declining
 
05:33:05.750 --> 05:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
student enrollment but an increasing
 
05:33:08.948 --> 05:33:08.958 align:start position:0%
percentage of the students with IEPs
 
05:33:10.310 --> 05:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's gone up from
 
05:33:15.150 --> 05:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
175% to 21 a. half% a 4% increase in
 
05:33:18.350 --> 05:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
seven years is frightening
 
05:33:22.510 --> 05:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
tramatic um I think that uh the total
 
05:33:24.830 --> 05:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
cost a billion dollars more or less on
 
05:33:28.830 --> 05:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
special ed is just astonishing and then
 
05:33:30.628 --> 05:33:30.638 align:start position:0%
when you see that the districts are by
 
05:33:33.590 --> 05:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
and large covering 85% of it you can
 
05:33:37.470 --> 05:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
understand why it's a constant human
 
05:33:40.548 --> 05:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
crime from the districts and affects
 
05:33:43.230 --> 05:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
their budget so radically and then I'm
 
05:33:48.230 --> 05:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
looking uh at our third uh page chart
 
05:33:51.830 --> 05:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
here picking up Fall Mountain which uh
 
05:33:53.430 --> 05:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
you know I know intimately enough to put
 
05:33:54.948 --> 05:33:54.958 align:start position:0%
these figures in
 
05:33:58.390 --> 05:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
perspective um their
 
05:34:02.548 --> 05:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
uh their CAD Aid claims I guess is the
 
05:34:05.628 --> 05:34:05.638 align:start position:0%
right way to put that about
 
05:34:08.990 --> 05:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh one point 2
 
05:34:11.590 --> 05:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
million they would have been eligible
 
05:34:14.548 --> 05:34:14.558 align:start position:0%
for about half of that in reimbursement
 
05:34:18.510 --> 05:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
612,000 but because of the pration which
 
05:34:22.230 --> 05:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
is so sharp nearly a third um this cuts
 
05:34:25.910 --> 05:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
down the the actual uh reimbursement to
 
05:34:28.230 --> 05:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
421,000 so instead of getting half back
 
05:34:30.750 --> 05:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
they're getting a third back so it's
 
05:34:35.708 --> 05:34:35.718 align:start position:0%
just you know I don't know how we as a
 
05:34:38.350 --> 05:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
state get under
 
05:34:42.230 --> 05:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
control um alleviating the burden on our
 
05:34:45.190 --> 05:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
schools and I just wonder what is
 
05:34:48.350 --> 05:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
driving the uh increased number of
 
05:34:50.190 --> 05:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
students on IEPs The increased
 
05:34:52.150 --> 05:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
percentage The increased costs what
 
05:34:54.628 --> 05:34:54.638 align:start position:0%
what's what are the root problems
 
05:34:57.350 --> 05:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
that I I think that's a rhetorical
 
05:34:58.750 --> 05:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
question I don't think there's an answer
 
05:35:02.350 --> 05:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
for us today yeah and and so so thank
 
05:35:04.430 --> 05:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
thanks for that representative spilsbury
 
05:35:06.868 --> 05:35:06.878 align:start position:0%
because you know a lot of that a lot of
 
05:35:08.590 --> 05:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
that what you talked about those are
 
05:35:09.948 --> 05:35:09.958 align:start position:0%
numbers that we can see from the
 
05:35:11.948 --> 05:35:11.958 align:start position:0%
adequacy spreadsheets you can see the
 
05:35:14.788 --> 05:35:14.798 align:start position:0%
enrollment Trends you can see the number
 
05:35:17.430 --> 05:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
of of um of students across the state
 
05:35:20.470 --> 05:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
and by District you know um uh receiving
 
05:35:22.788 --> 05:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
special that are on IEPs because it's
 
05:35:26.548 --> 05:35:26.558 align:start position:0%
right in the different Sheed a um so um
 
05:35:28.270 --> 05:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
part it very much presents an outof
 
05:35:30.788 --> 05:35:30.798 align:start position:0%
control fixture doesn't it well but but
 
05:35:33.070 --> 05:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
but on here there's there's there there
 
05:35:35.510 --> 05:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
were some obviously some numbers where
 
05:35:38.310 --> 05:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
there's a where there's a just a a rapid
 
05:35:41.510 --> 05:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
growth over over a short six-year period
 
05:35:45.070 --> 05:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
like from um 388,000 is the Max total
 
05:35:50.270 --> 05:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
cost student in 2019 to to now 200,000
 
05:35:54.670 --> 05:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
almost 200,000 more um 5
 
05:35:58.830 --> 05:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
171,000 uh for that and um not sure how
 
05:36:02.948 --> 05:36:02.958 align:start position:0%
many students are are are in that in
 
05:36:05.948 --> 05:36:05.958 align:start position:0%
that sort of you
 
05:36:08.990 --> 05:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
know significant need category because I
 
05:36:13.150 --> 05:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:15.230 --> 05:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
was I
 
05:36:18.270 --> 05:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
mean 21 over attributed to average
 
05:36:19.590 --> 05:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
student customer I don't know if that
 
05:36:21.230 --> 05:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
those are these are all dollar amounts
 
05:36:25.190 --> 05:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
not student counts so um so we're not
 
05:36:28.030 --> 05:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not necessarily seeing
 
05:36:32.150 --> 05:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
student count Trend data in in this in
 
05:36:34.430 --> 05:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
this you know in the in the special
 
05:36:36.510 --> 05:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
education Aid which is the most
 
05:36:39.310 --> 05:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
severe we're seeing cost Trend data
 
05:36:46.310 --> 05:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:50.030 --> 05:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:54.390 --> 05:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
submitted yeah but but but but by by
 
05:36:56.230 --> 05:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
sort of you know by these sort of
 
05:36:58.708 --> 05:36:58.718 align:start position:0%
categories you know between you know
 
05:37:00.510 --> 05:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
below three and a half between three and
 
05:37:03.708 --> 05:37:03.718 align:start position:0%
a half and 10 and above 10 and where
 
05:37:09.030 --> 05:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
where's the growth um coming from and um
 
05:37:10.750 --> 05:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
because it certainly seems like that
 
05:37:13.910 --> 05:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
that Top Line has has grown
 
05:37:13.920 --> 05:37:17.788 align:start position:0%
that Top Line has has grown
significantly

05:37:17.788 --> 05:37:17.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:20.750 --> 05:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
um it does appear to me that the
 
05:37:22.670 --> 05:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
increased student count is a significant
 
05:37:25.070 --> 05:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
driver but that the costs per student
 
05:37:31.548 --> 05:37:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:34.070 --> 05:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
significant but we also received I
 
05:37:37.070 --> 05:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't put my hands on it just then um
 
05:37:39.868 --> 05:37:39.878 align:start position:0%
information we had a chart showing the
 
05:37:42.430 --> 05:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
13 IEP categories and there were certain
 
05:37:45.390 --> 05:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
categories which were exploding on
 
05:37:48.628 --> 05:37:48.638 align:start position:0%
us and that would you know I think
 
05:37:52.788 --> 05:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
that's a reflection on our society it's
 
05:37:55.030 --> 05:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
a reflection maybe on how we're
 
05:37:56.708 --> 05:37:56.718 align:start position:0%
addressing some of the stuff in the
 
05:37:59.110 --> 05:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
schools um
 
05:38:02.110 --> 05:38:02.120 align:start position:0%
um expectations aspirations all that
 
05:38:06.190 --> 05:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
stuff come into play here um and uh so I
 
05:38:07.868 --> 05:38:07.878 align:start position:0%
think that we need to be looking at that
 
05:38:10.190 --> 05:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
and saying okay what's the root cost of
 
05:38:12.750 --> 05:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
that uh we can see it as a result of
 
05:38:15.070 --> 05:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
dollars but we can also see it result of
 
05:38:15.080 --> 05:38:16.910 align:start position:0%
dollars but we can also see it result of
certain

05:38:16.910 --> 05:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
certain
 
05:38:16.920 --> 05:38:18.750 align:start position:0%
certain
IEPs

05:38:18.750 --> 05:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
IEPs
 
05:38:21.190 --> 05:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
so what I'm taking away from this is
 
05:38:24.110 --> 05:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
that we're putting a heavy burden on the
 
05:38:26.350 --> 05:38:26.360 align:start position:0%
local school district to provide a
 
05:38:28.350 --> 05:38:28.360 align:start position:0%
program which costing one out of every
 
05:38:32.110 --> 05:38:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:34.670 --> 05:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
education and and in some districts more
 
05:38:39.030 --> 05:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
like one out of three yeah yeah yeah
 
05:38:41.708 --> 05:38:41.718 align:start position:0%
so so I think whatever we do we have to
 
05:38:43.350 --> 05:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
take remember that and try and
 
05:38:45.628 --> 05:38:45.638 align:start position:0%
incorporate into what we're trying to
 
05:38:48.190 --> 05:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
achieve in terms of funding and
 
05:38:48.200 --> 05:38:49.430 align:start position:0%
achieve in terms of funding and
education

05:38:49.430 --> 05:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:38:52.030 --> 05:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
here but we also have to send a message
 
05:38:55.390 --> 05:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
out that you know
 
05:38:59.948 --> 05:38:59.958 align:start position:0%
that it can't it we got somehow
 
05:39:03.430 --> 05:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
get in charge oversight of this program
 
05:39:08.190 --> 05:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
somehow uh to I'm not saying we're were
 
05:39:11.548 --> 05:39:11.558 align:start position:0%
misidentifying some of these kids but
 
05:39:13.910 --> 05:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
the costs are just you know we can't
 
05:39:15.548 --> 05:39:15.558 align:start position:0%
keep going like that so what's what's
 
05:39:17.548 --> 05:39:17.558 align:start position:0%
the answer is it how we're teaching uh
 
05:39:20.110 --> 05:39:20.120 align:start position:0%
the instruction the curriculum how we're
 
05:39:22.150 --> 05:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
grouping how we're structuring how we're
 
05:39:25.190 --> 05:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
organizing um how our families are the
 
05:39:27.868 --> 05:39:27.878 align:start position:0%
parenting yeah so so so Mr chair I mean
 
05:39:31.030 --> 05:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
if if Ian you know we're talking about
 
05:39:33.868 --> 05:39:33.878 align:start position:0%
just looking at the last the last column
 
05:39:37.510 --> 05:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
on the very last page 169,000
 
05:39:41.948 --> 05:39:41.958 align:start position:0%
um kids and there's um 870 Statewide
 
05:39:44.708 --> 05:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
that were subject to reimbursement in
 
05:39:47.830 --> 05:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
the in the special education grant and
 
05:39:50.190 --> 05:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
and and and interest I'm interested in
 
05:39:52.750 --> 05:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
the I'm not interested in where the kids
 
05:39:54.628 --> 05:39:54.638 align:start position:0%
are who the kids are or anything like
 
05:39:58.910 --> 05:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
that but the distribution of of that 870
 
05:40:00.948 --> 05:40:00.958 align:start position:0%
into the into the different buckets the
 
05:40:03.510 --> 05:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
below three well there's zero below 3.5
 
05:40:06.150 --> 05:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
because we don't you know do that but
 
05:40:10.390 --> 05:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
3.5 to 10 and above and above 10 and um
 
05:40:12.110 --> 05:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
and then and then maybe even getting
 
05:40:16.708 --> 05:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
some gradient in terms of in terms of um
 
05:40:20.468 --> 05:40:20.478 align:start position:0%
case I don't know what the term is um
 
05:40:23.070 --> 05:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
but but it it it takes something to get
 
05:40:24.830 --> 05:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
up to almost
 
05:40:28.030 --> 05:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
$600,000 I mean I uh you know the
 
05:40:30.230 --> 05:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
department did not have an answer to
 
05:40:31.708 --> 05:40:31.718 align:start position:0%
what went into a
 
05:40:34.468 --> 05:40:34.478 align:start position:0%
$600,000 uh those those those children
 
05:40:38.270 --> 05:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
are the minority first work cost our big
 
05:40:39.868 --> 05:40:39.878 align:start position:0%
costs are what we talked about below
 
05:40:44.150 --> 05:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's down lower and and uh it's I I I
 
05:40:46.030 --> 05:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
feel it's identification I looked at for
 
05:40:47.788 --> 05:40:47.798 align:start position:0%
example the city of
 
05:40:51.030 --> 05:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
Hanover how much how many kids are in in
 
05:40:55.110 --> 05:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
in receiving special Aid support there
 
05:40:57.910 --> 05:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
zero you're telling me there's no child
 
05:40:59.708 --> 05:40:59.718 align:start position:0%
there that's getting some support they
 
05:41:01.150 --> 05:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
have differentiated aid but there's
 
05:41:03.750 --> 05:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
nothing there in cat
 
05:41:07.310 --> 05:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
a so I think a lot has to do with how
 
05:41:10.350 --> 05:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
local is running the show and I
 
05:41:12.150 --> 05:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
understand Hanover has a different
 
05:41:14.070 --> 05:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
population I understand achievement
 
05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
scores are probably off the charts uh
 
05:41:20.430 --> 05:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
but you know it I've always thought that
 
05:41:22.948 --> 05:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
kids regardless of wealth had
 
05:41:22.958 --> 05:41:25.350 align:start position:0%
kids regardless of wealth had
handicapping

05:41:25.350 --> 05:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
handicapping
 
05:41:28.590 --> 05:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
conditions very no no AB absolutely
 
05:41:28.600 --> 05:41:31.990 align:start position:0%
conditions very no no AB absolutely
absolutely

05:41:31.990 --> 05:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:35.350 --> 05:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I guess I'm just wondering if
 
05:41:38.830 --> 05:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
if if this if if if this this
 
05:41:41.868 --> 05:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
information is really what we need um to
 
05:41:44.510 --> 05:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
work from or if it's something else that
 
05:41:46.830 --> 05:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
gives us a picture of what you're trying
 
05:41:48.708 --> 05:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
to what we're all trying to get a better
 
05:41:51.868 --> 05:41:51.878 align:start position:0%
understanding of so that we can um we
 
05:41:54.390 --> 05:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
can address concerns that you've
 
05:41:57.430 --> 05:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
presented in terms of the definition of
 
05:42:01.548 --> 05:42:01.558 align:start position:0%
IEPs and and then what um what sort of
 
05:42:05.030 --> 05:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
what sort of services um you know are
 
05:42:06.750 --> 05:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
you know provided by the in the
 
05:42:11.190 --> 05:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
different way 13 different I no no no
 
05:42:14.150 --> 05:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
categories uh that that I'm not sure
 
05:42:16.590 --> 05:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
this this is really putting
 
05:42:19.430 --> 05:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
the putting the the help to get to a
 
05:42:22.030 --> 05:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
solution standpoint that's that's it's
 
05:42:23.788 --> 05:42:23.798 align:start position:0%
further identifying that there's an
 
05:42:26.110 --> 05:42:26.120 align:start position:0%
issue that there's an issue I GRE doing
 
05:42:27.948 --> 05:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
that represent poit you had your hand up
 
05:42:30.150 --> 05:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
and then represent cop thank you I um
 
05:42:31.868 --> 05:42:31.878 align:start position:0%
just wanted to let the committee know
 
05:42:34.310 --> 05:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
that I took the liberty of speaking with
 
05:42:38.070 --> 05:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
Melisa and asking her for um breakdown
 
05:42:40.110 --> 05:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
of these students that get catastrophic
 
05:42:45.070 --> 05:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
Aid 800 800 900 of them in total cost
 
05:42:47.070 --> 05:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
and broken down in buckets of 10K like
 
05:42:49.830 --> 05:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
70 to 80 80 to 90 Statewide so there is
 
05:42:51.350 --> 05:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
no privacy issue you know I don't want
 
05:42:52.830 --> 05:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
to see that by District because then you
 
05:42:55.110 --> 05:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
really narrow it down so you know when
 
05:42:56.948 --> 05:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
she sends it to the to Jennifer
 
05:42:58.430 --> 05:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
everybody will get it but I wanted you
 
05:43:00.390 --> 05:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
to know that uh you know that was
 
05:43:03.350 --> 05:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
requested I took the liberty of and I
 
05:43:05.270 --> 05:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
did want to check if we know if we'll
 
05:43:07.948 --> 05:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
exact that bill today or not paron me
 
05:43:10.070 --> 05:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
are we going to exact that bill that we
 
05:43:11.910 --> 05:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
were on had on the back burner because
 
05:43:14.510 --> 05:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
of the amendment one bill so we we could
 
05:43:16.830 --> 05:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
wipe off really quickly here the one
 
05:43:20.110 --> 05:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
that you did the amendment on represent
 
05:43:23.510 --> 05:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
Damon so are we yeah well represent coom
 
05:43:26.230 --> 05:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
had her hand up here thank you Mr
 
05:43:29.110 --> 05:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
chairman I don't know if the Department
 
05:43:31.070 --> 05:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
of Education members who are here can
 
05:43:33.150 --> 05:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
answer this question or not but you you
 
05:43:36.628 --> 05:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
brought up the 13 14 categories that we
 
05:43:39.670 --> 05:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
received from Becky fet and what I'm
 
05:43:42.468 --> 05:43:42.478 align:start position:0%
noticing on this is that for
 
05:43:46.110 --> 05:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
2023 the number of um Statewide
 
05:43:49.190 --> 05:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
disability here is 32,019 but they're
 
05:43:51.510 --> 05:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
showing on this report that it's
 
05:43:56.150 --> 05:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
35717 so I'm curious where the 3, 3500
 
05:43:58.990 --> 05:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
um difference is in that that number of
 
05:44:02.150 --> 05:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
students that are um counted with IEPs
 
05:44:04.190 --> 05:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I was wondering is
 
05:44:07.628 --> 05:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
if we could maybe get um the def of
 
05:44:10.910 --> 05:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
emotional um disturbance and how that is
 
05:44:12.868 --> 05:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
utilized in this report you know who are
 
05:44:16.350 --> 05:44:16.360 align:start position:0%
they classifying into the emotional
 
05:44:18.468 --> 05:44:18.478 align:start position:0%
disturbance but the numbers on this
 
05:44:20.548 --> 05:44:20.558 align:start position:0%
report are not balancing with the
 
05:44:22.510 --> 05:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
numbers on this report for those years
 
05:44:25.190 --> 05:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
they're they're quite different yeah
 
05:44:26.670 --> 05:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
Mark Mark can answer that because we've
 
05:44:28.750 --> 05:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
had that question before so so there's
 
05:44:30.230 --> 05:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
different ways to measure student yeah
 
05:44:32.910 --> 05:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
ad admr
 
05:44:35.350 --> 05:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
BKK um we have to dig into exactly what
 
05:44:37.788 --> 05:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
the differences are but um I been asked
 
05:44:40.070 --> 05:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
to do that as far as denominator number
 
05:44:41.628 --> 05:44:41.638 align:start position:0%
um but it's probably just a measur of
 
05:44:42.788 --> 05:44:42.798 align:start position:0%
how student is
 
05:44:46.230 --> 05:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
defined or is it the time in which that
 
05:44:49.070 --> 05:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
number derived
 
05:44:51.468 --> 05:44:51.478 align:start position:0%
from can we also have do you happen to
 
05:44:53.750 --> 05:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
know what's going into the emotional
 
05:44:55.590 --> 05:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
disturbance how
 
05:44:58.990 --> 05:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
that's defined so that we know what
 
05:45:01.030 --> 05:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
class okay
 
05:45:04.830 --> 05:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
thanks okay let Pard me oh represent
 
05:45:07.468 --> 05:45:07.478 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman
 
05:45:13.150 --> 05:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
so to me um the numbers of of who gets
 
05:45:14.910 --> 05:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
an i
 
05:45:18.270 --> 05:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
IEP seem relatively accurate right if
 
05:45:20.830 --> 05:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
you look at for every single School
 
05:45:23.468 --> 05:45:23.478 align:start position:0%
District the percentage of their kids
 
05:45:27.468 --> 05:45:27.478 align:start position:0%
who have an IEP is either High Teens or
 
05:45:27.478 --> 05:45:28.628 align:start position:0%
who have an IEP is either High Teens or
low

05:45:28.628 --> 05:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
low
 
05:45:34.948 --> 05:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
20% right it's 19% 20% 21% like that um
 
05:45:37.310 --> 05:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
and and those things are we somebody has
 
05:45:40.468 --> 05:45:40.478 align:start position:0%
an i AP or not is apparently determined
 
05:45:44.948 --> 05:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
ex completely locally so if you have 200
 
05:45:47.590 --> 05:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
school districts everyone is getting
 
05:45:50.190 --> 05:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
roughly the same sort of number then
 
05:45:53.868 --> 05:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
it's accurate okay what's
 
05:45:59.190 --> 05:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
different is how much is being spent on
 
05:46:02.830 --> 05:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
the average IEP right so I gave you the
 
05:46:05.788 --> 05:46:05.798 align:start position:0%
exam the examp my favorite examples of
 
05:46:08.350 --> 05:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester and marac but but there are
 
05:46:11.468 --> 05:46:11.478 align:start position:0%
some districts that are that the amount
 
05:46:15.270 --> 05:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
they spend per IEP is quite low and
 
05:46:19.310 --> 05:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
others it's quite high so it seems to me
 
05:46:21.750 --> 05:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's where the local there's local
 
05:46:25.070 --> 05:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
variance and it's also where the
 
05:46:28.390 --> 05:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
incentives we give them are backwards
 
05:46:31.628 --> 05:46:31.638 align:start position:0%
because the way we give
 
05:46:34.070 --> 05:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
um whatever is formerly known as
 
05:46:37.030 --> 05:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid I guess it's special
 
05:46:40.910 --> 05:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
special ed Aid sped Aid okay
 
05:46:44.190 --> 05:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
um the more you spend the more we give
 
05:46:46.468 --> 05:46:46.478 align:start position:0%
right and and we start at a very high
 
05:46:50.150 --> 05:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
end so you know but but
 
05:46:54.590 --> 05:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
also so I I guess I would be like the
 
05:46:58.788 --> 05:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
incentive to be what we want which is
 
05:47:00.468 --> 05:47:00.478 align:start position:0%
make your
 
05:47:03.910 --> 05:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
averages near the state average right in
 
05:47:07.030 --> 05:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
terms of spending so so the point being
 
05:47:10.510 --> 05:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
if your average spending per I AP is at
 
05:47:14.230 --> 05:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
or below the state average will give you
 
05:47:18.070 --> 05:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
you know x% of that cost but if your
 
05:47:20.910 --> 05:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
average starts to creep up over the
 
05:47:24.548 --> 05:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
state average right and maybe we could
 
05:47:26.708 --> 05:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
do this just for the the
 
05:47:31.510 --> 05:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
basic sped costs the 0 to 70k types then
 
05:47:34.270 --> 05:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
we would give you a lesser percent of
 
05:47:37.150 --> 05:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
that number if you see what I mean right
 
05:47:42.030 --> 05:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
so so we could we could try to to push
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
the incentive to keeping your costs
 
05:47:47.590 --> 05:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
under control because right now all
 
05:47:51.430 --> 05:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
we're saying is you know you have a
 
05:47:54.510 --> 05:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
speech therapist yes okay I'll pay the
 
05:47:57.990 --> 05:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
check right but but is it a $500 speech
 
05:48:00.948 --> 05:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
therapist is it a $200 speech therapist
 
05:48:04.750 --> 05:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
we don't care right so so
 
05:48:07.708 --> 05:48:07.718 align:start position:0%
um that seems to me to make some sense
 
05:48:12.150 --> 05:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
is is align the incentives with keeping
 
05:48:15.628 --> 05:48:15.638 align:start position:0%
costs under control thank you Mr chair
 
05:48:17.390 --> 05:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
okay we
 
05:48:20.390 --> 05:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
yes um so thank you very much for
 
05:48:23.910 --> 05:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
listening I I have to disagree you said
 
05:48:27.230 --> 05:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
The more you spend the more we give um
 
05:48:30.030 --> 05:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
but we're only giving um I think it was
 
05:48:33.230 --> 05:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury said around a
 
05:48:37.868 --> 05:48:37.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:40.190 --> 05:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
around a third of the cost so the
 
05:48:45.190 --> 05:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
incentive is nowhere near to make to say
 
05:48:47.910 --> 05:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
oh gee I should spend a whole lot more
 
05:48:49.590 --> 05:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
money because I'm going to get a whole
 
05:48:52.230 --> 05:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
lot more because I'm still going to have
 
05:48:55.948 --> 05:48:55.958 align:start position:0%
to come up with 2third of what I am
 
05:48:59.230 --> 05:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
spending so I I I disagree I don't
 
05:49:01.270 --> 05:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
believe that the incentive is there to
 
05:49:05.468 --> 05:49:05.478 align:start position:0%
spend more money on uh special ed
 
05:49:08.910 --> 05:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
students okay um yes represent fellows
 
05:49:11.468 --> 05:49:11.478 align:start position:0%
um yes I just I I understand U
 
05:49:13.750 --> 05:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire's you know want
 
05:49:17.750 --> 05:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
to get a handle on this but to expect
 
05:49:19.390 --> 05:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
all the districts to have something
 
05:49:21.548 --> 05:49:21.558 align:start position:0%
that's close to the same average just
 
05:49:23.990 --> 05:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense because you have
 
05:49:26.110 --> 05:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester that has thousands of
 
05:49:28.510 --> 05:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
students and then and then you have a
 
05:49:30.430 --> 05:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
district that's only the elementary
 
05:49:34.230 --> 05:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
level and only has 200 students and you
 
05:49:37.110 --> 05:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
put a family moves into the district and
 
05:49:39.590 --> 05:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
they have you know three kids that need
 
05:49:42.150 --> 05:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
special ed you just can't expect them
 
05:49:44.110 --> 05:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
everybody to get on the same page in
 
05:49:46.270 --> 05:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
terms of a
 
05:49:48.868 --> 05:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
percentage that absolutely makes sense
 
05:49:51.948 --> 05:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
right so so it's only the the larger
 
05:49:53.910 --> 05:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
districts that could
 
05:49:56.868 --> 05:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
be controlled in in the what I'm the way
 
05:49:56.878 --> 05:50:01.990 align:start position:0%
be controlled in in the what I'm the way
I'm

05:50:01.990 --> 05:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:04.110 --> 05:50:04.120 align:start position:0%
describing okay what what I'd like to do
 
05:50:06.830 --> 05:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
before we head head out today is to take
 
05:50:06.840 --> 05:50:08.510 align:start position:0%
before we head head out today is to take
care

05:50:08.510 --> 05:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:50:11.230 --> 05:50:11.240 align:start position:0%
484 that's a bill relative re
 
05:50:13.030 --> 05:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
reallocation repurposing Career
 
05:50:17.548 --> 05:50:17.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:20.708 --> 05:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
space we had agreed upon an amendment
 
05:50:23.948 --> 05:50:23.958 align:start position:0%
right here is that um something to in
 
05:50:27.070 --> 05:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
order to move this CTE Bill
 
05:50:30.270 --> 05:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
forward there you go so um I'd like to
 
05:50:33.150 --> 05:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
hand the gav to the vice
 
05:50:47.590 --> 05:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:54.070 --> 05:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
3 we're we're reallying this yes
 
05:50:56.750 --> 05:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
484 and why is it going to me you making
 
05:50:57.910 --> 05:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
well because I want to make a motion to
 
05:51:00.510 --> 05:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
get out of here
 
05:51:04.150 --> 05:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay all right so I'm going to reopen
 
05:51:07.910 --> 05:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
the executive session on 8 B
 
05:51:11.430 --> 05:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
484 and recognize representative lad for
 
05:51:13.110 --> 05:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
an amendment yes I'd like to make a
 
05:51:19.070 --> 05:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:33.468 --> 05:51:33.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:36.110 --> 05:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
Mo okay so we have a second would you
 
05:51:37.670 --> 05:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
like to speak to the motion yes I'd like
 
05:51:41.070 --> 05:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
to make a motion to approve
 
05:51:45.070 --> 05:51:45.080 align:start position:0%
0358 H this is an amendment to
 
05:51:47.910 --> 05:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
484 and it makes the change there you
 
05:51:50.990 --> 05:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
can see on lines 7 through
