00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh good morning members of the committee
 
00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 align:start position:0%
my name is Steven andris I'm a
 
00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 align:start position:0%
prosecutor at the Marat County
 
00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 align:start position:0%
Attorney's Office I've been a prosecutor
 
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 align:start position:0%
for a little over 20
 
00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
years we're talking about the habitual
 
00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
offender Statute in this case it's RSA
 
00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
26223 there's a sentence within that
 
00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
that statute that begins with the words
 
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
provided however normally a sentence
 
00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 align:start position:0%
that begins with provided however is an
 
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
exception to a
 
00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 align:start position:0%
rule uh in this case you'll see that the
 
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
exception is that a sentence may be
 
00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 align:start position:0%
suspended um when driving a motor
 
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle was necessitated by situations
 
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
of extreme
 
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
emergency however it's an exception to a
 
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
rule that no longer exists there used to
 
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
be a rule in 2016 in the habitual
 
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
offender statute that created a minimum
 
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
mandatory one-year sentence and there
 
00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 align:start position:0%
was language in the statute that
 
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
indicated uh no portion of that minimum
 
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
mandatory shall be suspended this
 
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
created an exception to that rule the
 
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
difficulty is that in 2016 the
 
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
legislature amended the habitual
 
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
offender statute got rid of the minimum
 
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
mandatory got rid of the prohibition on
 
00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 align:start position:0%
uh suspending any portion of the
 
00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
sentence but left this sentence in the
 
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
reason that this creates some confusion
 
00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 align:start position:0%
is we've had judges read this sentence
 
00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 align:start position:0%
to to mean that they can only suspend
 
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
sentences in cases of extreme emergency
 
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh which I don't believe is the case I
 
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
believe that the legislature intended
 
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
judges to have discretion in the bital
 
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
offender statute which is consistent
 
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
with the prior uh ho amendment I did
 
00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 align:start position:0%
send out a a handout that I wrote
 
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday to everybody emailed it and
 
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
had a couple extra hard copies if anyone
 
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
needed it and I'm happy to answer
 
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
it thank thank you
 
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
so we fixed it in 2016 so that the judge
 
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
had discretion to suspend a sentence if
 
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
he wanted to prior to that he could not
 
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
and people got the sentence we left this
 
00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
in there when we did it so they still
 
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
think that they may have to impose a
 
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
minimum sentence is that correct correct
 
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
okay I know at least one judge that we
 
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
regularly go in front of reads this
 
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 align:start position:0%
sentence to mean that he can only
 
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
suspend the sentence in cases of extreme
 
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
emergency I see okay
 
00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
committee yeah U go ahead uh
 
00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
representative side under under what
 
00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
circumstances would a judge be inclined
 
00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
to suspend part of the
 
00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 align:start position:0%
sentence uh so the habitual offender
 
00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
statute I'm not sure how familiar you
 
00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 align:start position:0%
are with it but in New Hampshire if you
 
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
commit a certain number of Motor Vehicle
 
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
offenses you can be certified as an
 
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.749 align:start position:0%
offenses you can be certified as an
habitual

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
habitual
 
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
offender the they break that into major
 
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
and minor offenses so if you
 
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
accumulate I believe it's 12 speeding
 
00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
tickets or it might be eight speeding
 
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
tickets um you can be certified as an
 
00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 align:start position:0%
habitual offender if you accumulate
 
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
three operating after suspension charges
 
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
you can be certified as an habitual
 
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
offender because those are major
 
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
offenses so it's any combination of
 
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
three Majors 12 minors or a combination
 
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
of for example one major and I think
 
00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
it's eight minors or two majors and four
 
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
minors you you can be certified as an
 
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.310 align:start position:0%
minors you you can be certified as an
habitual

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
habitual
 
00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
offender if you're certified as an
 
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
habitual offender you lose your license
 
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
for a period of 5 years so there's a
 
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
5year period you can't
 
00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 align:start position:0%
drive um we've certainly had cases where
 
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
people for example lost their license as
 
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
habitual Defenders maybe 10 years ago
 
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
because they had three operating after
 
00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 align:start position:0%
suspensions or um a dozen speeding
 
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
tickets and they just never bothered to
 
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
get their license back and you'll have a
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
situation where someone is um you know
 
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
we we've certainly had situations where
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
there's a car mechanic who's bringing a
 
00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
car in a test drive and uh gets pulled
 
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
over and his we find out he's an
 
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
habitual offender gets charged with
 
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
being an habitual offender it it didn't
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
make sense in some of these cases to
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
send this person to prison for a period
 
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
of a year um one to five years which is
 
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
what the the prior minimum mandatory was
 
00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
however it does make sense to perhaps
 
00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
suspend a sentence hang hang it over
 
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
that person's head to inspire them to to
 
00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
follow the law in the future so there's
 
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
certainly a lot of you know sort of fact
 
00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
specific scenarios where we'd want to
 
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
provide an appropriate sentence which
 
00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
would include a suspended period of time
 
00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 align:start position:0%
uh to to help the person comply with the
 
00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
future any further
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
questions represent sitech if I may
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
since we're pretty much on board with
 
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
this I think may I ask you a bit of
 
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
History it seems to me that a driving
 
00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
offence shouldn't be more should how
 
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
does it get to be a felony a year in
 
00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
jail for speeding tickets would seem
 
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 align:start position:0%
enough why did this get promoted to
 
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.510 align:start position:0%
enough why did this get promoted to
felony

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
felony
 
00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
status so being certified as an habitual
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
offender itself didn't bring any jail
 
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
time with it so what would happen is if
 
00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
you accumulated a certain number of
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
points on your license essentially or a
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
number of offenses within a 5year period
 
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 align:start position:0%
you'd be summoned to the DMV they would
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
have a hearing and they would certify
 
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
you as an habitual offender if you
 
00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
didn't drive during that period you you
 
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
were fine it's not like you were going
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
to jail or anything for that if you did
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
Drive during that period of time that's
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
when the felony offense comes about is
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
you're violating the order of the
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles not to
 
00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:28.039 align:start position:0%
drive while you're certified as an
 
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
habitual offender
 
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that answers your
 
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
question or makes sense the question is
 
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
why is it promoted to a felony status
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
when I think a year in jail for speeding
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
tickets is plenty what motivated the
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
legis do this is a bit of History
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with this you don't my
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
I'll stop here I I can't say what
 
00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:51.879 align:start position:0%
motivated the legislature at the time I
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
know that certainly one way to become an
 
00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
habitual offender is to accumulate three
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
driving well intoxicated convictions and
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
it's strikes me that if a person
 
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:02.360 align:start position:0%
accumulates three driving will
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
intoxicated convictions and then
 
00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
continues to drive after they've lost
 
00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:07.159 align:start position:0%
their license for a period of 5 years
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
that that is a fairly serious offense
 
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
that does in fact deserve a felony
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
conviction but just for clarification
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
everyone here that is no longer the law
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
what is the current state of the law
 
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
with regard to driving after when you're
 
00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:22.919 align:start position:0%
a habitual offender it is a felony if
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
the certification was based on a
 
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor a driving well intoxicated
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
or if you have a sub quent um habitual
 
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
offender conviction but it doesn't carry
 
00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
a minimum mandatory correct it no longer
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
carries a minimum mandatory and it is
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
possible to be a misdemeanor in certain
 
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances for example the the 12
 
00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039 align:start position:0%
speeding tickets would be a misdemeanor
 
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
a vitual offender see so what we did is
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
we took out that minimum mandatory so
 
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
the judge had more discretion but at
 
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
least one judge seems to think he
 
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't have discretion and that's why
 
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
we're taking this out of here correct
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
yes and this sentence is just confusing
 
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
in in isolation Okay thank you any
 
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
further questions for attorney
 
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
Enders seeing none thank oh oh uh oh we
 
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.790 align:start position:0%
Enders seeing none thank oh oh uh oh we
got

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
one just so I'm clear right now today it
 
00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:17.959 align:start position:0%
has to be a save a life of lim so if we
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
remove all that then that means that the
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
judge has discretion to do whatever he
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
chooses to do is that correct is that
 
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
another way of looking at it sort of and
 
00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:31.079 align:start position:0%
the reason I say sort of is because many
 
00:09:33.069 --> 00:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
judges view this as they're able to
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
suspend the sentence under any
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances there's at least one judge
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
who says I can only suspend it under the
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
circumstances listed in the statute to
 
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
save life or limb we're trying to
 
00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:44.839 align:start position:0%
clarify that judges can suspend the
 
00:09:49.069 --> 00:09:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances if that makes sense okay
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
so yes it clarifies that they can use
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
their discretion to do as they please
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
yes it clarifies that the judges are
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
able to use their discretion thank which
 
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
was what the legislature intended in
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
2016 by removing the minimum mandatory
 
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
off any any further questions for turn
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay see none thank you very much for
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
presenting us with us today and um we'll
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
take it up as soon as we get um clean up
 
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:25.880 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
to introduce amendment number 2423 H and
 
01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
can I get a second seconded by
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
representative gaite I'll speak to the
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
motion the amendment is the amendment
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
suggested by the County Attorney we just
 
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
heard from it makes a technical fix to
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
the law that will allow judges
 
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
discretion to um suspend sentences
 
01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
rather than impose them there are he
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
said that we had at least one judge out
 
01:00:28.829 --> 01:00:28.839 align:start position:0%
there that felt he still had to
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
implement a mandatory sentence which was
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
clearly not our intent when we fixed it
 
01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.670 align:start position:0%
clearly not our intent when we fixed it
in

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:00:36.029 --> 01:00:36.039 align:start position:0%
2016 um though I was not here then it
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
seems to be pretty clear um any
 
01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
discussion would you like to speak to
 
01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
your second representative of Catherine
 
01:00:44.109 --> 01:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
no I think you did a good jve anyone
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
else want to talk about it it seems
 
01:00:49.029 --> 01:00:49.039 align:start position:0%
pretty clear no thank you representative
 
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
scitec actually nothing to do with this
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
but we're going to have an echo of this
 
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
because if you call I did not want to
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
gum up the
 
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
works but there is uh in one of the
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
bills that we let go through it said if
 
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner is a a police
 
01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
officer which is not permitted by other
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
sections of the law so one day we're
 
01:01:14.029 --> 01:01:14.039 align:start position:0%
going to have to come and line that out
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
also but that was today wasn't the this
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't the day it's does no harm but I
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
just wanted since I had to sit here till
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
11 o'clock I wanted to say it yeah I I
 
01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:27.160 align:start position:0%
think you're right and often as we touch
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
these bills it's incumbent upon us to
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
take a look at them and make sure
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing else hanging around out
 
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
there that doesn't belong and this is uh
 
01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
clearly one of those cases anyone else
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
seeing no one I would ask the clerk to
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%

01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
