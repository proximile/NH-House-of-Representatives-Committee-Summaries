generally answering
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
um what the developer Andrew Keller uh
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
indicated was his intention regarding
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
the sale of all the power generated by
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
this proposed facility
 
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.650 align:start position:0%
this proposed facility
um

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:47.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
so that's where we are any questions
 
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee
 
00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify so according to
 
00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:07.100 align:start position:0%
this the intention of the solar
 
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
farm is to make all of the elect the
 
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes my understanding is that under
 
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
the Community and this is where I'm out
 
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
of my depth uh the community power rules
 
00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
um his intention is to sell all the
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
power to a municipality uh I I false I
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
mistakenly assumed it would be Nashua
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
but it will be a New Hampshire
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
municipality not necessarily Nashua and
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
then all the power and then
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
if you have questions about how the
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
program works I I highly suggest asking
 
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
the Deputy Commissioner
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh for the record

um I can't speak to the specifics of
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
this project but it sounds like the
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
developer's intention is to participate
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
in the uh recently approved Community
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%

be able to achieve either lower costs or
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
more stable costs in other cases a
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%

a an agreement with the town to sell

benefits the town are prioritizing the
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%

00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
around in different locations so what we
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
determined was and they had made some
 
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
other requests like they wanted us to
 
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
donate a 10-foot strip along the front
 
00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:24.419 align:start position:0%
of the property and and as you know we
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ability to donate
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
State Property so what we did is we went
 
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
back to the town and said this is
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
probably more appropriate for you to
 
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
address this with the with the buyer
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
when they go through the planning board
 
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
process so uh reconfiguring that we
 
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
added a small portion of the property we
 
00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:48.740 align:start position:0%
added area 0.28 acres
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
and increased the property value from or
 
00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:54.299 align:start position:0%
or what our asking price that we're
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
seeking to ask from 500 1 100 to 576
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
thousand one hundred dollars we did an
 
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:04.980 align:start position:0%

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:06.660 align:start position:0%

00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:01.019 align:start position:0%
parcel vacant land was acquired from
 
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:03.419 align:start position:0%
David Smith in 2006 for the Conway
 
00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
bypass project for seventy one thousand
 
00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
dollars which included a 344 square foot
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
temporary construction easement
 
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.070 align:start position:0%
temporary construction easement
um

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
the 0.75 acre parcel acquired for the
 
00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:19.859 align:start position:0%
project is identified on the project
 
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
plan as parcel 51 a staff appraiser from
 
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
the Department evaluated the the subject
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
property properties market value and
 
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
determined it was 55
 
00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.109 align:start position:0%
determined it was 55
000

00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
the reason for the decrease in property
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
is that because we didn't build the
 
00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
project this property is is basically
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
landlocked and is only marketable to the
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
aboutting property owner
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you one quick question will this
 
00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:51.899 align:start position:0%
money have to go back to the feds as
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
part of the club back for us not doing
 
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
the project yes
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
yes this will go back to our payback Our
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
we've got to consider I don't have an
 
00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
exact number I can get you that but um
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
we've got
 
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
a number of properties still left to
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
sell that we're working through with
 
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
further questions go ahead now what
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
about we did purchase a number of houses
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
what what are we doing with those Homes
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
at this time we were renting the world
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
and some of them were in bad repair and
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
disrepared truly what are we doing now
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
so I'd have to check to see what if any
 
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
residential dwellings that we're still
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
leasing up there so if the property I
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
mean we're selling the properties as is
 
00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
um and so it is a pretty good demand but
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of those houses now that they've
 
00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
been vacant for 15 years or so they're
 
00:35:59.210 --> 00:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
in bad shape they'll likely be raised
 
00:36:01.609 --> 00:36:01.619 align:start position:0%
and something will be built on them
 
00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:03.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
