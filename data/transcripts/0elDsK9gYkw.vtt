00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
it being 203 I'll go ahead and start
 
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 align:start position:0%
this work session on division three
 
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 align:start position:0%
so so what is uh my intent for today
 
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
certainly we're going to do what we said
 
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
we would do we're going to have the
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
economic security briefing uh I'd also
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
like us to complete our discussion that
 
00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
we started the other day on hb2
 
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative Stringham is not here
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
today did he ask you representative
 
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
tolersky if you'd be open to doing the
 
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
okay 42. clock is ticking yeah so
 
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.830 align:start position:0%
okay 42. clock is ticking yeah so
um

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 align:start position:0%
so one of the things I I would say to
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham is um he's been
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
working a special project on behalf of
 
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
division three most of you may know but
 
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
because he has such strong experience in
 
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.220 align:start position:0%
Medicare reimbursement rates and because
 
00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
we felt like to me that we had come to
 
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
the conclusion that we would like to
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
take a look at some of the Medicaid
 
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates to see if there was
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
a small subset that we ought to Tinker
 
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
with to just make sure that we don't
 
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
break anything in the coming two years
 
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
that would hopefully buy time for the
 
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
Department to go do a complete top to
 
00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:43.259 align:start position:0%
bottom rate setting drill us for the
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
next budget so but but I'd like to just
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that we stop the bleeding so
 
00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday when we have another work
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
session I'm going to ask and would you
 
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
remind me let's send an email to Jerry
 
00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
so that that he knows that on Tuesday
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have him just tell us where
 
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:06.620 align:start position:0%
he's at in that process
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not expecting him to be complete or
 
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
anything but the nature of the exercise
 
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
is we're going to run out of time before
 
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
it's complete
 
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
because it's it's a bottomless pit of
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
potential but we have to just get
 
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:25.740 align:start position:0%
something done making it better than it
 
00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:28.259 align:start position:0%
is so so
 
00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
that's what we're going to do a little
 
00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:31.979 align:start position:0%
bit on Tuesday today we're going to talk
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
about Economic Security and we're going
 
00:08:37.329 --> 00:08:37.339 align:start position:0%
to try to talk about hb2
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
is there anything I'm missing here Mr
 
00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.350 align:start position:0%
is there anything I'm missing here Mr
Ripple

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
Ripple
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
nope I don't think so oh okay so so what
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
am I missing representing money
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
well we're also going to meet Monday at
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock
 
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
uh all right Mr Wyatt let's let's let's
 
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Nathan white Chief
 
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer with the Department of
 
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
afternoon Karen Hebert I'm the director
 
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
for the division of economic stability
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
now be before you you will see a couple
 
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:26.300 align:start position:0%
of different documents
 
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
we have our standard presentation
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
in the PowerPoint presentation we've
 
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:35.220 align:start position:0%
also handed out a position movement
 
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:37.740 align:start position:0%
document here as well this is similar to
 
00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:39.959 align:start position:0%
what you've seen for the other divisions
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
and then in the governor's recommended
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
budget we will be beginning on page 890
 
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
and with that I will hand it over to
 
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.410 align:start position:0%
and with that I will hand it over to
Karen

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
I also would just like to introduce I
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
have a team of PR Chiefs program experts
 
00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
here with me today I'm very proud of
 
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
them they did accompany me
 
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
for this particular presentation so I
 
00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:08.420 align:start position:0%
just wanted to introduce my team is here
 
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
so this division has been was created in
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
2018 the mission of this division is
 
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
essentially to enhance the health
 
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
economic and social well-being of
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
individuals families and communities
 
00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:28.100 align:start position:0%
so going through the presentation itself
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
can can we just I I need to get oriented
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
to the book I believe Mr White said in
 
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget we're starting on
 
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
page eight nine zero that's correct okay
 
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:43.740 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm seeing titles like Child
 
00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:45.740 align:start position:0%
Development operations
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh child development program are am I on
 
00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:52.019 align:start position:0%
the right page yes sir you are okay very
 
00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:53.690 align:start position:0%
the right page yes sir you are okay very
good

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
so if you go to slide three in the
 
00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
presentation it essentially gives you
 
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
some orientation to the structure of
 
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
this particular division
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
there are six primary programs or
 
00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:08.579 align:start position:0%
bureaus if you will which include
 
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
the child of development and Head Start
 
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.470 align:start position:0%
the child of development and Head Start
collaboration

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
collaboration
 
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
it includes the child support services
 
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
family assistance which is two parts
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
there's field operations for family
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
assistance and then there is what I
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
refer to as a business and policy side
 
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
of the house
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
another our questions already Yes okay
 
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.730 align:start position:0%
another our questions already Yes okay
so

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
um I heard you say that this division
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
started in around 2018 was that the year
 
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay and I see the
 
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
division Mission would you would you
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
tell us right up front uh was this a
 
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
statutory direction or was this at the
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
discretion of the commissioner to
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
establish this division this was
 
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
discretion of the commissioner
 
00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
description discretion of the
 
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
commissioner yes sir and and to what
 
00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.509 align:start position:0%
commissioner yes sir and and to what
extent

00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
extent
 
00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
are your programs maybe at a subordinate
 
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
level uh associated with statutory
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
obligations and you can if you would
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
just tell us that as we go through your
 
00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
slide deck that would be fine I I just
 
00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I know the
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
distinctions between where where we've
 
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
exercised good judgment on the part of
 
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and and where you guys
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
are required to do the ridiculous stuff
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
we ask you to do as the legislature okay
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
all right sure so each of the bureaus
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
and or programs do have statutory
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
requirements uh federal and state so
 
00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:38.459 align:start position:0%
where I was was with the family
 
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
assistance Bureau which is in two parts
 
00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
so and then we also have the Bureau of
 
00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
Employment supports
 
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:49.740 align:start position:0%
we have what's known as the new heights
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
Administration that new heights is the
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
integrated and eligibility and
 
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
enrollment I.T system
 
00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
and also the program known as
 
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Family Support Services
 
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
so those six primary programs exist but
 
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
from a budget perspective the lead
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
programs here that we're going to go
 
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:15.740 align:start position:0%
through are really the child development
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
and Head Start collaboration
 
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
that I will move into child support
 
00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:23.459 align:start position:0%
services and then the Bureau of family
 
00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:26.339 align:start position:0%
assistance the other programs are
 
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the Bureau of family
 
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:32.220 align:start position:0%
assistance budget and I will go through
 
00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.930 align:start position:0%
assistance budget and I will go through
those

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
do you have specific slides you're going
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
to hit on New Heights because I'm gonna
 
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
so the division if you're moving to
 
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
slide four you'll see some key outcomes
 
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
that I've highlighted this division
 
00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
directly serves individuals and families
 
00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
some temporarily
 
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
and others with long-term Services based
 
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
on their circumstances and eligibility
 
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
for different assistance programs these
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
are economic related services that
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
people absolutely need
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
some of them just to survive or to have
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
basic life necessities
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
through these Services we directly and
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
indirectly also support the business
 
00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:26.269 align:start position:0%
indirectly also support the business
community

00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
this positively impacts the state's
 
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.290 align:start position:0%
this positively impacts the state's
economy

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
economy
 
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
there are cost avoidance components in
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
each of our accounting units of these
 
00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:37.139 align:start position:0%
programs which prevent the need for
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
public assistance
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
our programs contribute to the reduction
 
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
of poverty
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
we stabilize individuals and families so
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
that they no longer need or will not
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
need public assistance and we help those
 
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
who do need it
 
00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
and each program does this in a unique
 
00:14:54.899 --> 00:14:56.150 align:start position:0%
and each program does this in a unique
way

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
we're there when you need it
 
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
and we're there when you can't survive
 
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
without it
 
00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:05.339 align:start position:0%
our programs also support and educate
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
parents building protective factors such
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
as concrete supports or resiliency
 
00:15:14.449 --> 00:15:14.459 align:start position:0%
ultimately preventing child welfare
 
00:15:14.459 --> 00:15:18.710 align:start position:0%
ultimately preventing child welfare
interventions

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
on Slide Five you will see a number of
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
key accomplishments of this division I'm
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
not going to go through each one of them
 
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
but I will say that we have been
 
00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:30.779 align:start position:0%
successful in strengthening families and
 
00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:32.389 align:start position:0%
successful in strengthening families and
individuals

00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
we have strengthened our infrastructure
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
so that we can provide greater access to
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
and delivery of services
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
and we model on a whole person or whole
 
00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.189 align:start position:0%
and we model on a whole person or whole
family

00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
a question on the new case management
 
00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:54.530 align:start position:0%
a question on the new case management
practices

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
practices
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
to um I know this is something that the
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
representative hole and I have talked
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
about is to to what extent do you have
 
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:07.019 align:start position:0%
support from an I.T system perspective
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
to help you
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:17.459 align:start position:0%
of of support that the Department's
 
00:16:20.569 --> 00:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
trying to provide who's accountable for
 
00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
that case and how much time is being
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
spent on each of those cases do you have
 
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
any I.T to do that or do you do you even
 
00:16:33.769 --> 00:16:33.779 align:start position:0%
try to capture that kind of data sure in
 
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
both the systems New Heights as well as
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
the New England Child Support
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
Enforcement system uh the acronym for
 
00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:45.079 align:start position:0%
that is Nexus both of those do
 
00:16:45.079 --> 00:16:46.749 align:start position:0%
that is Nexus both of those do
identify

00:16:46.749 --> 00:16:46.759 align:start position:0%
identify
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
cases individually as well as the
 
00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:53.959 align:start position:0%
assignment of those cases to each worker
 
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
there are also dashboards available for
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
the caseworker to operate on daily
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
operational work that they will need to
 
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
do then as a result of automation that
 
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:08.579 align:start position:0%
is built into the system so that they
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
know what to follow up on what might
 
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.730 align:start position:0%
know what to follow up on what might
need

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:12.740 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
what maybe information may be missing
 
00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:16.970 align:start position:0%
what maybe information may be missing
um

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
a variety of
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
pieces come up on that dashboard to
 
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to start with the Bureau of
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
Child Development and Head Start
 
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.070 align:start position:0%
Child Development and Head Start
collaboration

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
collaboration
 
00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:39.059 align:start position:0%
and really looking at everything through
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try to walk through from a
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
budget perspective on these
 
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
particular Bureau
 
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
this is all about child care assistance
 
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
for low-income families to provide
 
00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
access to high quality and safe and
 
00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
reliable child care so that parents can
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
seek gainful employment
 
00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:03.539 align:start position:0%
this Bureau as it reads here assures
 
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
family access to the child care
 
00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
assistance program it's formally known
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
as the New Hampshire Child Care
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship program
 
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
we strengthen the child care system in
 
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to support business and
 
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
economic development
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
we provide support and professional
 
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
development opportunities to the
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
provider community in child care
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
we help parents to make informed choices
 
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
to support their own child's development
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
and choices for their providers that
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
they wish to have their child be taken
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
care of
 
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
so uh can let's talk about Head Start
 
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
for just seconds sure is is this is this
 
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
the same Head Start From it's a federal
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
program that's been around since the 60s
 
00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
or late or early 70s it is and so so
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
what the department has done by creating
 
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
this Bureau has taken its own State
 
00:18:57.289 --> 00:18:57.299 align:start position:0%
efforts and initiatives and integrated
 
00:18:59.570 --> 00:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
it so that it's complementary with the
 
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
Head Start program or why are these two
 
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
things in one Bureau the federal office
 
00:19:08.409 --> 00:19:08.419 align:start position:0%
of Head Start requires that states
 
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
identify a lead agency that it would
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
collaborate with
 
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
on the state level and for New Hampshire
 
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
that agency is the Bureau of child
 
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.470 align:start position:0%
that agency is the Bureau of child
development

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
development
 
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
so the name apparently is important to
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
the federal government that we include
 
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
in the name of that Bureau that is a
 
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
collaboration it's a collaborative
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
relationship with the Head Start program
 
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
so we provide quality Support Services
 
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
to Head Start there's a lot of
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
collaboration that's done a review of
 
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
between rules and regulations that those
 
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:48.299 align:start position:0%
um now there's been a lot of studies in
 
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
the Head Start area
 
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
most of which are like either neutral on
 
00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:57.299 align:start position:0%
the success of Head Start or or not very
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
complementary that that it's not hitting
 
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
its objectives on a sustained basis so
 
00:20:06.409 --> 00:20:06.419 align:start position:0%
like the kids get some support early
 
00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
like Pre-K or so and that within a year
 
00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
or two after that
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
they are exhibiting the exact same
 
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
outcomes as kids that didn't go through
 
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
the Head Start program that's what I
 
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
think I remember
 
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
can you correct me on that or or is that
 
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
is that a correct remembering of the
 
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
research so far I believe there's quite
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
a bit of research out there and what I'd
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
like to do is go back and consult with a
 
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
program and then I can provide you with
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
some current research information for
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
you to have at your reference but just I
 
00:20:45.169 --> 00:20:45.179 align:start position:0%
I would take a summary because I'm not
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
going to be able to read a whole thing
 
00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:48.419 align:start position:0%
but I I would like to get updated
 
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
because the I'm dealing with
 
00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
eight-year-old information on Head Start
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't all that great is it is it
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
pretty is it pretty
 
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
is are the Head Start or the Head Start
 
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
program components though fairly stove
 
00:21:08.529 --> 00:21:08.539 align:start position:0%
piped to where they're operating within
 
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
their own boundary conditions and
 
00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
requirements I'm still trying to figure
 
00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
out the extent to which you're
 
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
integrating it with State efforts for
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
and then I'll go to representative
 
00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.059 align:start position:0%
Wallner so yeah and I I think I would
 
00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
defer to the Beer Chief and Child
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
Development to answer that question a
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
little bit easier than okay if that's
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon hello I'm Deborah Nelson
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
the BR chief for Child Development and
 
00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:42.539 align:start position:0%
Head Start collaboration talk talk
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
straight into the mic otherwise it's
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
hard for people like me to hear you
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
okay sound like a phone commercial
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
um well thank you for that question and
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
I'm eager to answer it so the studies
 
00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
you were quoting focused on academics we
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
know the business of Early Childhood is
 
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
play social emotional development
 
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
learning how to learn and being prepared
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
to succeed when you get to a formal
 
00:22:09.289 --> 00:22:09.299 align:start position:0%
School setting and Head Start does that
 
00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
beautifully so so the studies you read
 
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
were basically academic studies versus
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
social emotional and and yes so children
 
00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
in Head Start when they get to third
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
grade they don't show different outcomes
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
on math and math scores per se but they
 
00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
show Advanced social emotional skills
 
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:27.740 align:start position:0%
that help them be too successful
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
lifelong Learners learning how to learn
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
learning how to get along with their
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
peers so those newer studies demonstrate
 
00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:36.539 align:start position:0%
the critical importance of Head Start
 
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify
 
00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:42.299 align:start position:0%
um so our Bureau does not receive nor
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
monitor the millions of dollars that go
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
directly from the office of Head Start
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
in Washington to local grantees rather
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
the Head Start collaboration office
 
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
there's one of us in every single state
 
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
and that was put into the Head Start act
 
00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
by Senator Kennedy many years ago
 
00:23:00.049 --> 00:23:00.059 align:start position:0%
purpose being that because it was
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
Federal to local there was not any
 
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:04.740 align:start position:0%
necessarily state level coordination of
 
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
what Head Start was doing at the grantee
 
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
level so those offices were put in place
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
basically one-person offices to make
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
sure that they collect you know they
 
00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:15.299 align:start position:0%
help the grantees collaborate with one
 
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
another and with child care and dcyf and
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
all the other programs and services
 
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
within a state that care about and work
 
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
with children and families so that we're
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
all working together toward the same
 
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
things the the beauty of having the Head
 
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
Start collaboration office in together
 
00:23:33.289 --> 00:23:33.299 align:start position:0%
with the with the child former Child
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
Development Bureau is the capacity to
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
leverage resources and to truly have a a
 
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:41.700 align:start position:0%
functional integrated level of work for
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
example when we do our credential
 
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
revision we look at Head Start
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
credentialing as well as child care
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
credentialing when we do our policy when
 
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
we built our Granite steps for Quality
 
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
quality recognition Improvement system
 
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
Head Start voice was at the table so we
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
were building one system for all so it's
 
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
really been you know a wonderful
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to leverage resources and
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that all Early Childhood
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
voices are are heard and that where you
 
00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:12.059 align:start position:0%
know the services that we provide work
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
for all of our early childhood folks
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay all of that's beautiful love it
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
Mr White would you stick our fingers
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
exactly where the Head Start Start
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
Federal money is and show us to the
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
extent if any that there's general fund
 
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
requirements there's
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
um if I'm if it's 125 000 each year
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's no I have to see it no
 
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
no so so what what we're referring to
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
there with the the 125 it's on page 892.
 
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
uh to count 29.79 Head Start
 
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
collaborative that that's a standalone
 
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
grant for Head Start
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
um I think what's also important just to
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
point out here is beginning on page 890
 
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.890 align:start position:0%
point out here is beginning on page 890
accounts

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:56.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.770 --> 00:24:59.780 align:start position:0%
2976-2979-2978 there's approximately
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
27.5 million dollars of child care
 
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
development funds that the state
 
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.070 align:start position:0%
development funds that the state
receives

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
receives
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
um to to support these programs and um
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
part of that's Moe uh we we have to put
 
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
forward 4.5 million dollars of General
 
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
funds yeah say that number again 4.5
 
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
million dollars or the the big number of
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
the little number
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay and and we're we're where's the 4.5
 
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
million is that spread over several
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
lines yeah yeah so so the the three
 
00:25:33.169 --> 00:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
accounts the 29 76 2977 and 2978 that
 
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
could collectively that's where we have
 
00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:36.740 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
27.25 million dollars of ccdf so the
 
00:25:42.769 --> 00:25:42.779 align:start position:0%
child care Development Fund dollars and
 
00:25:45.529 --> 00:25:45.539 align:start position:0%
there's there's a 4.5 million Moe mixed
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
with that there's a 50 50 match and then
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
there's discretionary dollars and those
 
00:25:51.409 --> 00:25:51.419 align:start position:0%
discretionary dollars are provided by
 
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
the federal government and those
 
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
fluctuate from year to year so some of
 
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
the variation that you see in the
 
00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
federal funds within those accounting
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
units that's based on the discretionary
 
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
dollars that that we'll be getting over
 
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
the next biennium
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Waller
 
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
um Miss Nelson actually addressed what I
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to say and that was that Head
 
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
Start receives for the programs in the
 
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
communities that's directly that that
 
00:26:21.529 --> 00:26:21.539 align:start position:0%
program money goes directly from the
 
00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
federal government to the programs it
 
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:26.820 align:start position:0%
does not flow through the department and
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
this is just a grant to coordinate
 
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
between the state and Head Start and
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
child care and I think what Mr
 
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
uh White was just now speaking about was
 
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
actually the child care portion of the
 
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
budget which is is very different than
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
from the Head Start portion
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:08.330 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
so as Mr White was describing uh the
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
different Federal funding streams that
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
do support child development so the
 
00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:18.440 align:start position:0%
first accounting unit here
 
00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:23.900 align:start position:0%
2976 that starts on page 890.
 
00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:27.059 align:start position:0%
there is no information in the briefing
 
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
book because that particular budget is
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
under a million dollars so it is not in
 
00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
the briefing book yet it is the
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
essentially the back office if you will
 
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
it is the Operational Support and
 
00:27:42.289 --> 00:27:42.299 align:start position:0%
administration of this particular Bureau
 
00:27:44.409 --> 00:27:44.419 align:start position:0%
it's a hundred percent federally funded
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
and does provide the Operational Support
 
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 29.77
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
is the child development program this is
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.470 align:start position:0%
the funding for employment related child
care

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
this funding also is to meet has meets
 
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
State matching and maintenance of effort
 
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.590 align:start position:0%
State matching and maintenance of effort
requirements

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
there are just by way of information 624
 
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
providers who serve children that
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:36.409 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:28:36.409 --> 00:28:36.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
give me an idea of what that amount is
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
that a family might receive to assist
 
00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:42.059 align:start position:0%
them in this child care
 
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
or alternatively the number of families
 
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
that receive assistance
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:01.820 align:start position:0%
so the number of
 
00:29:03.769 --> 00:29:03.779 align:start position:0%
families in the program I think it's
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
approximately three thousand who receive
 
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:09.299 align:start position:0%
the scholarship program
 
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
and I will have to
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
find data that I might have about the
 
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:17.700 align:start position:0%
average amount that a family receives it
 
00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:19.740 align:start position:0%
is I believe it varies quite a bit
 
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
because it's based on a number of
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
factors to determine eligibility that
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
include income household size
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
um so I'll have to do a little digging
 
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
for you that's okay you don't need to go
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
through all that
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
my follow-up question might actually
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
help answer my question
 
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.070 align:start position:0%
help answer my question
um

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:39.299 align:start position:0%
is I'm assuming it's a is it a partial
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
or is it a hundred percent
 
00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
um scholarship for care it there is a
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
cost share for parents and that also is
 
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
dependent on a number of factors that
 
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
answers my question thank you excellent
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative Cole did you have a
 
00:29:54.769 --> 00:29:54.779 align:start position:0%
question I did thank you I'm looking at
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
page at one of the
 
00:29:59.090 --> 00:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
you're calling it the budget briefing
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
book right and it looks like there the
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
caseload was 31.79 right dropping down
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
the 29.56
 
00:30:09.409 --> 00:30:09.419 align:start position:0%
sorry about that so I'm looking at page
 
00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
one of the budget briefing book correct
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
caseload is dropping roughly from 3200
 
00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:18.059 align:start position:0%
to 29.50 correct and yet the cost per
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
case the line above it's going from 9400
 
00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
the first jump this year
 
00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start position:0%
or I guess 2023 was in 10 000 rounding
 
00:30:30.169 --> 00:30:30.179 align:start position:0%
up a little bit to 11 7.
 
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
um that's a 17 jump in 24 and then level
 
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
funded for 25.
 
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
um what was the jump for 24 and not why
 
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
was that not split evenly between the
 
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
two years I
 
00:30:45.169 --> 00:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
oh my factor is just the cost of child
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
care that has increased
 
00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.490 align:start position:0%
care that has increased
fairly

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
so the next accounting unit uh is the
 
00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:00.539 align:start position:0%
child care development quality assurance
 
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
it's 29.78 this is also a book number is
 
00:31:09.769 --> 00:31:09.779 align:start position:0%
891 briefing book page numbers three
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
this is also 100 federally funded
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
and I think it's important to note 12
 
00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
percent of these particular funds must
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
be spent on quality as well as infant
 
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
and on the last accounting unit which we
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
have touched on is 29.79 that is the
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
Head Start State collaborative that is
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
I can move to the next program if you
 
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
are ready I I appreciate your pause
 
00:32:03.169 --> 00:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
there because it's just given me a
 
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
chance to figure out where I am in in
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
the budget book so I think to
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative walner's point that uh
 
00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
the reason there's very little Head
 
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
Start money showing here we're talking
 
00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
125 000 or so it's because the money is
 
00:32:21.529 --> 00:32:21.539 align:start position:0%
bypassing the state budget altogether
 
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
and going directly to local providers
 
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
that is correct okay and then so this
 
00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:28.700 align:start position:0%
hundred and twenty five thousand or so
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
even that's Federal money that they
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
Grant to us to help us administer this
 
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
program is that the point okay got it
 
00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:39.830 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
representable

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
representable
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
thank you back to page one of the budget
 
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
briefing book
 
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
so of this caseload I assume that's the
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
number of children or is that the number
 
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
of families do you know
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:59.630 --> 00:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
um if you had a family with three or
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
four children that were right being
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
served is there a way to find out how
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
many families that is
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
I believe so yes yes I'm quite confident
 
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
about that right so if you had I don't
 
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
know hypothetically three children that
 
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
were receiving benefits going to
 
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
um a daycare or child care center right
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
you're now paying that person well north
 
00:33:24.649 --> 00:33:24.659 align:start position:0%
of minimum weight right you could have
 
00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
them at home with their parent
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
um potentially well north of of some of
 
00:33:33.529 --> 00:33:33.539 align:start position:0%
the wages in that right it would be
 
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:35.220 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand dollars or north of it
 
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
thirty five thousand dollars
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
in paid expenses for child care for a
 
00:33:42.409 --> 00:33:42.419 align:start position:0%
family right where there might be a way
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
to have them say with their parents and
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
be better off
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
at a lower rate unless they're making
 
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
significantly more than thirty five
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:33:51.889 --> 00:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
are you
 
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
to provide our perspective or the family
 
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
the family perspective yeah right so
 
00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
sure I think that's something that
 
00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
families are grappling with all the time
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
and we try to put out information so
 
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
that they can make those choices as to
 
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
what is going to be helpful for them and
 
00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:07.019 align:start position:0%
if they qualify for assistance for their
 
00:34:07.019 --> 00:34:07.970 align:start position:0%
if they qualify for assistance for their
children

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
um to be in child care services
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
that would enable them to work they need
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
to balance that out and make those
 
00:34:18.169 --> 00:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
decisions but isn't there an income
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
thresh threshold or eligibility
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
requirement for these services
 
00:34:22.919 --> 00:34:38.450 align:start position:0%
requirement for these services
yes

00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:46.609 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:34:46.609 --> 00:34:46.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
so uh eligibility levels income
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
eligibility levels for child care there
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
are actually six steps for initial
 
00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
determination of child care so if for
 
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
example the first step if you earn 100
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
percent of federal poverty level which
 
00:35:08.329 --> 00:35:08.339 align:start position:0%
is uh Eleven Hundred thirty three
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
dollars a month
 
00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.329 align:start position:0%
dollars a month
um

00:35:11.329 --> 00:35:11.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
then there are a number of other factors
 
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
that get determined with respect to the
 
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
number of children that you have are
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
they in child care part-time full-time
 
00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
there's certain definitions for that
 
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
that would then determine the amount
 
00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:26.339 align:start position:0%
that you would get
 
00:35:26.339 --> 00:35:29.329 align:start position:0%
that you would get
ineligibility

00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:29.339 align:start position:0%
ineligibility
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
is that information available
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:37.190 align:start position:0%
yes okay
yes

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
so there are different levels of service
 
00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
for example a full-time level of service
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
is defined as 31 or more hours a week
 
00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:47.579 align:start position:0%
There's halftime levels of service and
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
then there's part-time levels of service
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
um so there's quite a bit of detail into
 
00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
the formula it's a little bit
 
00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
complicated to but I can certainly
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
provide you with that information and a
 
00:36:02.089 --> 00:36:02.099 align:start position:0%
link to it great so I have a side
 
00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:05.099 align:start position:0%
question for Mr White or as we go
 
00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
through this is this the section of the
 
00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:11.579 align:start position:0%
budget where the TANF funds can be found
 
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
or or is it somewhere else also the TANF
 
00:36:17.089 --> 00:36:17.099 align:start position:0%
funds will be in a little bit we'll
 
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
we'll get there no but it's we're
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
talking about that today under economic
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
stability we're going to get the Tana
 
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
funds here yep yep I'll point out the
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
TANF Moe that we have and the Tana funds
 
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
that are being used but but in these
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
accounts these are the ccdf dollars
 
00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:32.579 align:start position:0%
right primarily and then the Head Start
 
00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
the 125 000. I'm just I know I have an
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
open question in my head about the hb2
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
TANF money so I want to make sure I'm
 
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
tracking as we go through the HP one
 
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
TANF money to see where that is I'll
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
draw attention to that when we get there
 
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
so if you're good I can move on to child
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
these are services that are provided to
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
families of children whose parents or a
 
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
parent and caretaker do not reside in
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
this Bureau Works to engage and assist
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
parents who are willing
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
and able
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
to support their children or unable to
 
00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
support their children due to any kind
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
of a barrier that might be preventing
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
them from paying such as being employed
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
and when necessary the bureau will
 
00:37:40.609 --> 00:37:40.619 align:start position:0%
enforce the responsibility by way of a
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
legal support order with parents who may
 
00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
all right so this is where I'm expecting
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
to see the term dcyf and it's probably
 
00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
my own ignorance can you can you can you
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
help me understand the relationship
 
00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
between the Bureau of Trials child
 
00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
support services that sounds very dcyf
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
like and and dcyf
 
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
there is an extremely low number of
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
cases and referrals we get from dcyf for
 
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
child support services okay so you you
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
receive dcyf referrals and that's what
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
this is it uh yes we can provide
 
00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:24.839 align:start position:0%
services to dcyf so if a child is in
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
placement uh dcyf may want to pursue
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
child support against one or both of the
 
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
child's parents
 
00:38:35.329 --> 00:38:35.339 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
either help initiate support for
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
reunification or to reimburse the
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
federal 4E program title 4E under the
 
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
Social Security Act uh paying for foster
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
care expenditures
 
00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.010 align:start position:0%
care expenditures
um

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
but like I said we get very very few
 
00:39:03.609 --> 00:39:03.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
no I just actually had a constituent
 
00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
reach out to me this week regarding this
 
00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
very situation and I went digging to
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
provide the resource and it turns out it
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
was your office and it was a um
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
a grandfather reached out to me because
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
his daughter has four children and the
 
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
um the children's father lives out of
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
state and was refusing to support and so
 
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
I did a little Googling and now it's
 
00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:32.099 align:start position:0%
just all coming together in my brain and
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
I believe I did the right thing by
 
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
directing them to you so thank you
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for referring to them yes so
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
we do provide services when one parent
 
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
is here in New Hampshire and the other
 
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
parent may be in another state or
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
another country we do pursue child
 
00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
support for parents
 
00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
um despite where the other parent may
 
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:52.609 align:start position:0%
um despite where the other parent may
live

00:39:52.609 --> 00:39:52.619 align:start position:0%
live
 
00:39:52.619 --> 00:39:53.569 align:start position:0%
live
um

00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:53.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
and despite if it's a grandparent that
 
00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.390 align:start position:0%
and despite if it's a grandparent that
has

00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
the child has been placed with a
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
grandparent or other relative or even
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
what we refer to as fictive Ken so we're
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
able to provide those services
 
00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
for folks who apply for it and it is not
 
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
I'll stop there
 
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
so we process approximately 76 million
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
dollars a year in child support for
 
00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.690 align:start position:0%
dollars a year in child support for
families

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
payments are distributed and dispersed
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
to families within 48 Hours typically
 
00:40:37.089 --> 00:40:37.099 align:start position:0%
less than that that's business hours
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
less than that from the time we receive
 
00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.750 align:start position:0%
less than that from the time we receive
them

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
this absolutely lessens the need for
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
and services are really a whole family
 
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
approach to Services as opposed to
 
00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
really being that Law and Order approach
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
these are Services where we look at the
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances of both families including
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
the paying parent to ensure that they
 
00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:06.839 align:start position:0%
have uh support and what they need in
 
00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
order to be able to support their
 
00:41:11.329 --> 00:41:11.339 align:start position:0%
children so whatever barrier they may be
 
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
experiencing we're there to provide
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
services to them too and connect them
 
00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
with appropriate resources or other
 
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
services that may help them overcome
 
00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
those barriers
 
00:41:23.329 --> 00:41:23.339 align:start position:0%
to so I'm just looking at the at the
 
00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
coloring book here where it says 66
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
percent are federally funded and then Mr
 
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
White I'm looking at page 900 where
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
under Child Support Services it looks
 
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
like the federal match that that
 
00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.329 align:start position:0%
like the federal match that that
is

00:41:40.329 --> 00:41:40.339 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
program are funded 66 percent by the
 
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
this is a very cost effective program
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
for every dollar it spends it collects
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
three dollars and fifteen cents for
 
00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.010 align:start position:0%
three dollars and fifteen cents for
families

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
this is a cost avoidance program it
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
reduces the need for public assistance I
 
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
have to challenge you I'm sorry you're
 
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
probably right still got to challenge
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
you you say it's cost effective it's
 
00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:14.579 align:start position:0%
costing us a dollar to go get three
 
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
dollars and fifteen cents
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
if if we were to go out and look at
 
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
collection agencies overall as an
 
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
industry do do we know how this
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
benchmarks relative to other efforts to
 
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
collect bad debts we've had collection
 
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
agencies come to us for help so they do
 
00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:34.140 align:start position:0%
not have access to the resources that
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
this particular program does as far as
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
locating parents and then being able to
 
00:42:41.089 --> 00:42:41.099 align:start position:0%
not just collect the funds that they may
 
00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
owe but enforce them so there are a
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
number of tools that the program is able
 
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:49.079 align:start position:0%
to use the collection agencies do not
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
have and there are regulations about
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
what a collection agency is actually
 
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
able to do versus what the Bureau of
 
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
child support child support programs
 
00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
across the country are able to do in
 
00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:03.849 align:start position:0%
across the country are able to do in
providing

00:43:03.849 --> 00:43:03.859 align:start position:0%
providing
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
those services but also the collection
 
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
of those payments that have to go
 
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
completely to the family so with your
 
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
additional Powers you're able to collect
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
at a higher rate than the typical uh
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
election agency arguably okay so
 
00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:21.589 align:start position:0%
election agency arguably okay so
um

00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
what are you doing or what could be done
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
to continually work on improving
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
efficiency so that it's a dollar for
 
00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:32.339 align:start position:0%
every four dollars collected what what's
 
00:43:35.089 --> 00:43:35.099 align:start position:0%
what's the next big thing to get an
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
improvement in that ratio
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
so some of the initiatives that the
 
00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.430 align:start position:0%
so some of the initiatives that the
bureau

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
barely revolve around the automated
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
Automation in the I.T system as well as
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
better services for Access and Service
 
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
delivery for parents who want to
 
00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.050 align:start position:0%
delivery for parents who want to
self-serve

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:53.060 align:start position:0%
self-serve
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
including things like a online
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
application instead of paper so having
 
00:44:01.849 --> 00:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
the convenience of being able to apply
 
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
for services online
 
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
um being able to look at your case
 
00:44:10.089 --> 00:44:10.099 align:start position:0%
status and information
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
through by means of we have a web-based
 
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
portal for child support there are a
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
number of enhancements that we want to
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
make in that then make it easier to use
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
including mobile friendly everybody is
 
00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
making their payments online we should
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
be able to do that as well we should be
 
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
able to have enable parents who are
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
paying to look up their information on
 
00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:35.099 align:start position:0%
their mobile phone and that if they
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to make a payment that way they
 
00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
should be able to do it right there on
 
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
the spot that would make things a lot
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
more efficient and getting money faster
 
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
to families as well so for what it's
 
00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:53.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:54.710 align:start position:0%
 
7931

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
7931
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
All-State child support programs are
 
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
required to have a state disbursement
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
unit and this is the union that
 
00:45:04.089 --> 00:45:04.099 align:start position:0%
processes all the money that comes in
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
distributed distributes it
 
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
electronically to match into our cases
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
and then disperses the funds by way of
 
00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
one of three different methods through
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
through the unit and the primary default
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
method is by way of a debit card I had
 
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
an example I was going to bring it looks
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
like any other credit card
 
00:45:29.809 --> 00:45:29.819 align:start position:0%
uh that is the default method we also
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
enables a very small number of
 
00:45:34.609 --> 00:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
individuals who want to get a paper
 
00:45:34.619 --> 00:45:35.770 align:start position:0%
individuals who want to get a paper
check

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:35.780 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
there is a customer service component to
 
00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
the State Disbursement Unit so that
 
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
either the paying parent or the
 
00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
receiving parent can receive information
 
00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
directly from them we also provide
 
00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
services through this unit for the
 
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
employer community so employers that
 
00:45:52.609 --> 00:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
have questions about any garnishment
 
00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
order they can certainly contact the
 
00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
State Disbursement Unit or to answer
 
00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
their questions they have a self-serving
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
portal as well so employers can go on
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
the portal and see exactly the status of
 
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
their employees who may be ordered to
 
00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:08.420 align:start position:0%
pay support
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
and what the and the ability to get
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
billing electronically from the State
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
Disbursement Unit as opposed to paper
 
00:46:16.079 --> 00:46:18.010 align:start position:0%
Disbursement Unit as opposed to paper
billing

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:18.020 align:start position:0%
billing
 
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
that is another service of the State
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
Disbursement Unit to manage the billing
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
of that for self-paying payers and
 
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.530 align:start position:0%
of that for self-paying payers and
employers

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
employers
 
00:46:29.569 --> 00:46:29.579 align:start position:0%
as I said earlier payments are dispersed
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
within 48 Hours
 
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.270 align:start position:0%
within 48 Hours
um

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
and that is the State Disbursement Unit
 
00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
the next unit is known as access and
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
visitation which is 7933 starts on page
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
901 of the budget book this item is not
 
00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
in the briefing book because it is under
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
a million dollars this is a hundred
 
00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar grant that the feds
 
00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:53.900 align:start position:0%
provide that the federal office provides
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
each year
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
the idea is that
 
00:46:58.319 --> 00:46:59.870 align:start position:0%
the idea is that
um

00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
parents who have I'm going to be rude
 
00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
okay I I want to fast forward a little
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
bit okay do a quick skip can can we can
 
00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
we get you to reset at uh page 12 with
 
00:47:16.849 --> 00:47:16.859 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Employment supports and I
 
00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
page 904 on the on the budget book I'd
 
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
be happy to now if I've just caused you
 
00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
to skip over something important don't
 
00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
let me make you do that
 
00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
it's all important but it's all
 
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
important that's true
 
00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:35.270 align:start position:0%
important that's true
um

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
no I think that if there are other
 
00:47:38.329 --> 00:47:38.339 align:start position:0%
questions about the child support
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
program or Child Support Services I'd be
 
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
more than happy to answer them but I can
 
00:47:44.809 --> 00:47:44.819 align:start position:0%
definitely move
 
00:47:44.819 --> 00:47:47.270 align:start position:0%
definitely move
ahead

00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
I was just about done with that anyway
 
00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
um so the employment supports
 
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:56.220 align:start position:0%
this particular Bureau I think is
 
00:47:58.609 --> 00:47:58.619 align:start position:0%
incredibly important in this division
 
00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:01.079 align:start position:0%
well they all are really but
 
00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
this program this is also known as the
 
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employment program or nhep
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
which this Bureau administers and
 
00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:11.099 align:start position:0%
provides employment provides Employment
 
00:48:14.089 --> 00:48:14.099 align:start position:0%
Services to individuals
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
primarily those who are recipients of
 
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
TANF which is temporary assistance for
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
needy families so for families single
 
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
parent families who are receiving
 
00:48:28.329 --> 00:48:28.339 align:start position:0%
assistance from the TANF program
 
00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:31.140 align:start position:0%
they have a requirement to participate
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
in the work program which is the New
 
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Employment Program
 
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
the idea is to assist them
 
00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:43.140 align:start position:0%
in many different ways so that they can
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
become gainfully employed whether it's a
 
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
matter of earning skills or just earning
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
find employment whatever they need to do
 
00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that
 
00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
we have and maintain relationships with
 
00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
the employer Community a number of
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
employers and we have a number of
 
00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
educational and training programs as
 
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
well and have relationships with those
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
organizations such as the community
 
00:49:13.609 --> 00:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
college system
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
to address also labor market needs
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
through training and education the
 
00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:21.020 align:start position:0%
bureau focuses a lot on high demand
 
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
employment that's needed in the state
 
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
and trying to if an individual comes
 
00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
along and they're interested in any of
 
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
those high demand jobs
 
00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:34.460 align:start position:0%
then we will absolutely
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
you know promoting those particular jobs
 
00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
for people who are interested in
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
pursuing them so so I have some
 
00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
questions here
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
it looks like in your in your in the
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
coloring book on page 13 those this is
 
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
32 ftes
 
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
as I go to the budget book for the 24
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
looks like it's 45 ftes so there's a
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
Delta of 13 I'd like to understand
 
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:05.220 align:start position:0%
um and then I have some other questions
 
00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
sure so in the um the Des position
 
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
movement document that I that we handed
 
00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:11.690 align:start position:0%
movement document that I that we handed
out

00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
um that that shows that transfer and so
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
the the the 32 number that you're seeing
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
that that's the that was was part of the
 
00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
original agency budget and from from the
 
00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
current operating budget and then what
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
you're seeing there in the 45 that's
 
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
included in the governor Governor's
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
recommended so that's the difference
 
00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.470 align:start position:0%
recommended so that's the difference
there

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
where we were transferring those
 
00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:33.890 align:start position:0%
where we were transferring those
positions

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:34.609 align:start position:0%
positions
um

00:50:34.609 --> 00:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
we were transferring those positions
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
from account 61 20 uh wait yes uh we
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.250 align:start position:0%
 
6127

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
6127
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
or these 13 positions going to do
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
something different or they have the
 
00:50:58.609 --> 00:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
same job titles and they're just moving
 
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
no they've been repurposed it's a
 
00:51:03.049 --> 00:51:03.059 align:start position:0%
repurpose correct
 
00:51:05.089 --> 00:51:05.099 align:start position:0%
so what were they doing that they don't
 
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
need to do anymore
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
so those positions are
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
family support
 
00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
service specialist position
 
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
in the Bureau of family assistance
 
00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:19.619 align:start position:0%
and they have been repurposed into this
 
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
particular Bureau for employment
 
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
counselor career counselor specialist
 
00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:26.990 align:start position:0%
counselor career counselor specialist
positions

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay that's close to the answer I'm
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
what are they not going to do anymore
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
process eligibility for applications
 
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
from individuals who
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
apply for any of the eligibility
 
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
programs that's what they're not going
 
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
to do anymore and they're no longer
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
needed there because New Heights is more
 
00:51:48.049 --> 00:51:48.059 align:start position:0%
efficient or some eligibility thing has
 
00:51:49.849 --> 00:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
happened to where we can do it more
 
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
efficiently what what's what's freeing
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
up I I'm I'm as I really am curious what
 
00:51:58.849 --> 00:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
did you all do to become so productive
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
you could move 13 people out of an old
 
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:04.140 align:start position:0%
job into a higher priority as
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
essentially that that particular Bureau
 
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
family assistance the family service
 
00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:11.150 align:start position:0%
family assistance the family service
specialists

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
specialists
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
in particular there is a high vacancy
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
rate there are a number of positions
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
that despite best efforts to recruit
 
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
have not been filled
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
so let's make use of them where it is
 
00:52:28.609 --> 00:52:28.619 align:start position:0%
also very much needed to provide
 
00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
services employing getting people back
 
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:33.660 align:start position:0%
into employment so the implication is
 
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
this job reclassification makes this a
 
00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
more interesting position and therefore
 
00:52:42.589 --> 00:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
you expect to find recruits for this
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
position these this location as opposed
 
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
to the previous location is this a job
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
enrichment effort basically
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
you could put it that way yes okay and
 
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
then so uh so it sounds to me like good
 
00:52:59.690 --> 00:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
Manpower management so
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
um now I'm questioning the head count
 
00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.549 align:start position:0%
um now I'm questioning the head count
though

00:53:03.549 --> 00:53:03.559 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
employment support
 
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
45 ftes going against this this is it
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
just sounds like a really heavy number
 
00:53:15.849 --> 00:53:15.859 align:start position:0%
when we're running into what feels like
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
systemic challenges in our Workforce and
 
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know what these 45 are going to
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
do to really move the needle on that I I
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
as I understand our Workforce problem is
 
00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
is that we just don't have the right
 
00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
qualified people and or the right
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
motivations to go work and so I'm
 
00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:38.900 align:start position:0%
curious how this employment support
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
organization is able to address that is
 
00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
it changing job skills of the of the
 
00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
clients or is it changing their
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
motivation to go work what what what are
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
you trying to do with these 45 so
 
00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
prism our employment counselor
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
Specialists who work with each
 
00:54:01.569 --> 00:54:01.579 align:start position:0%
individual to develop a customized
 
00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
employment plan a career plan with them
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
what is it they want to do and how do we
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
get them there there's a quite an
 
00:54:10.609 --> 00:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
extensive needs assessment that's
 
00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:13.640 align:start position:0%
conducted it's a very detailed
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
process if you will and then connecting
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
them with the ability to attain the
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
skills that they need whether it's
 
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
training whether it's credentials and
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
education and then connecting them with
 
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
employers so there are a number of
 
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
people other positions in this Bureau
 
00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
that work directly with the employer
 
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
Community to work on apprenticeship
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
programs on the job training programs a
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
number of different ways we try to
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
approach this to support the individual
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
to become self-sufficient
 
00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
so there are also administrative
 
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
functions in this Bureau with respect to
 
00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:53.720 align:start position:0%
things like audits quality assurance
 
00:54:56.569 --> 00:54:56.579 align:start position:0%
compliance monitoring that has to be
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
done to meet federal and state
 
00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.750 align:start position:0%
done to meet federal and state
requirements

00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
um this is we've changed the business
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
model for this particular Bureau so for
 
00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
a number of years the services that we
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
provide with respect to employment
 
00:55:14.089 --> 00:55:14.099 align:start position:0%
counseling have been split between the
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
state employees
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
and then also through contracted
 
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
Services basically doing the same job
 
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
there's some issues with that that we're
 
00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
trying to resolve so that there are
 
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
certain functions that only are
 
00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
contracted with a vendor that they would
 
00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:35.660 align:start position:0%
perform some of the more
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
intensity intensifying
 
00:55:39.119 --> 00:55:39.950 align:start position:0%
intensity intensifying
um

00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
work with individuals that require a
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
great deal of time
 
00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:46.940 align:start position:0%
with them
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
that state staff cannot do it so they're
 
00:55:53.569 --> 00:55:53.579 align:start position:0%
focused on a lot of the needs assessment
 
00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:56.220 align:start position:0%
and individualized planning for people
 
00:55:58.970 --> 00:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
and case management
 
00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
the vendor is providing additional in
 
00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
the interest of time yes okay so
 
00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
so two big questions
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
and I'll just ask them both
 
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:09.650 align:start position:0%
and I'll just ask them both
um

00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:13.380 align:start position:0%
one what sort of success metrics do you
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
have so that you know that the Manpower
 
00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
being invested in this is producing an
 
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
output that's adequate for the resources
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
invested that's a metrics question
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
second question is
 
00:56:27.599 --> 00:56:28.190 align:start position:0%
second question is
um

00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
is is there a rationale why this mission
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
is more appropriate under the
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of Health
 
00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:39.300 align:start position:0%
and Human Services relative to the
 
00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Labor
 
00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:42.950 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Labor
yes

00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
we provide
 
00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
quite a different service than
 
00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:49.140 align:start position:0%
Employment Security or even the services
 
00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:51.380 align:start position:0%
under the work opportunity
 
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
and Innovation act so we work with those
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
programs but this is a pretty
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
specialized population that needs a fair
 
00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:03.260 align:start position:0%
amount of support
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
and unique attention so that we are
 
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
finding success we do case management
 
00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
and individualized plans where the other
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
agencies do not really
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
provide that level of service
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
sure not not to be argumentative but but
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a process issue not a
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
not a jurors issue
 
00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:32.460 align:start position:0%
is there a specific Nexus between these
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
clients and the delivery of Health Care
 
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.970 align:start position:0%
clients and the delivery of Health Care
versus

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
versus
 
00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
just finding client not just because
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's important but finding these clients
 
00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.150 align:start position:0%
it's important but finding these clients
jobs

00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:46.700 align:start position:0%
what what is the what is the Health Care
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
Connection that that makes us a DHHS
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
so the healthcare Connection in this is
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
so this is about economic stability
 
00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
which ties very closely with individuals
 
00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:04.270 align:start position:0%
which ties very closely with individuals
health

00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
so if you look at so for example the
 
00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:09.589 align:start position:0%
so if you look at so for example the
individual

00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:58:12.049 --> 00:58:12.059 align:start position:0%
um maybe a young mother who has a young
 
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:13.700 align:start position:0%
child at home
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
no income no means of getting that
 
00:58:20.049 --> 00:58:20.059 align:start position:0%
income maybe not even Transportation
 
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
no direction of where to go no skill
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate to get a particular position
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
or she would serve or earn a particular
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
income in order to support her own
 
00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.309 align:start position:0%
income in order to support her own
family

00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
so we have individuals who would love to
 
00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
be able to pursue a career but instead
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
of having the ability to do that they
 
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
come to us for services including TANF
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
or snap
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
those kinds of assistance that they need
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
to get by
 
00:58:49.849 --> 00:58:49.859 align:start position:0%
this takes them a step further and gets
 
00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
them on a path towards self-sufficiency
 
00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
so that they don't need those assistance
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
programs anymore the more people are
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
able to be self-sufficient the healthier
 
00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:01.140 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be to be able to
 
00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:03.140 align:start position:0%
get to the doctor's office to afford
 
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
healthy food to afford
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
care and just
 
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
the right child care even
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
all of that points towards the health of
 
00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:17.220 align:start position:0%
the individual in the family so is this
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
function discretionary that the
 
00:59:20.569 --> 00:59:20.579 align:start position:0%
commissioner established this or was
 
00:59:23.569 --> 00:59:23.579 align:start position:0%
this statutory so this may be a good
 
00:59:27.049 --> 00:59:27.059 align:start position:0%
time just to talk about TANF because the
 
00:59:29.089 --> 00:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
the federal dollars that you do see here
 
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
in in this account on page 905
 
00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:37.140 align:start position:0%
um the the almost 8.9 million dollars of
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
federal funds those are 100 percent TANF
 
00:59:42.049 --> 00:59:42.059 align:start position:0%
and then you also see the general fund
 
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
match that we have there as well and so
 
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:46.140 align:start position:0%
we had talked about this a couple of
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
times over the past number of weeks
 
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:50.220 align:start position:0%
collectively the department has to meet
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
that 32 million dollar TANF spend in
 
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
order to get the 38 million dollars
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
um and and this is this is one of those
 
01:00:00.049 --> 01:00:00.059 align:start position:0%
key accounts uh where we use that money
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
I I think another important thing you
 
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
know we're talking and there are also a
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
number of initiatives that that I know
 
01:00:07.609 --> 01:00:07.619 align:start position:0%
Karen's team partners with employment
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
security on so I don't know if it's
 
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
worth talking about those relationships
 
01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.650 align:start position:0%
worth talking about those relationships
sure

01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
um so yeah there are a number you know
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
what I think I just heard you say and I
 
01:00:17.569 --> 01:00:17.579 align:start position:0%
I don't want to I don't want to get you
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
wrong is is that
 
01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
we have a challenge in a way that we
 
01:00:25.609 --> 01:00:25.619 align:start position:0%
have to hit a 32 million dollar level of
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
and if we don't meet that then we lose
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
we end up getting penalized in future
 
01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
years substantially for not having met
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
that level so it's incumbent upon us to
 
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
hit it
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
and one way that we're contributing
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
towards hitting it is by taking a
 
01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
program that doesn't sound to me like it
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
has a direct Health Care Nexus it sounds
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
to me like it's all very much Social
 
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
determinants of Health which is you know
 
01:00:59.450 --> 01:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
something slightly different than health
 
01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:00.170 align:start position:0%
something slightly different than health
care

01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
uh and but it's close enough that we can
 
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
rationalize putting it here and having
 
01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:08.270 align:start position:0%
rationalize putting it here and having
it

01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
contribute to that 32 million dollar
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
level of effort
 
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
that that it that it's being wedged in
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
here a little bit it feels like
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I'd characterize it as
 
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
as rationalizing or wedging in there I I
 
01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
think it's it's a more more strategic
 
01:01:24.359 --> 01:01:25.549 align:start position:0%
think it's it's a more more strategic
approach

01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:27.299 align:start position:0%
um that that that has fed into the
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
current structure today I mean I I think
 
01:01:31.849 --> 01:01:31.859 align:start position:0%
I and Karen can speak to that sure and
 
01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
and this actually this particular
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
program meets Federal requirements that
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
we have to have a participation in a
 
01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
work program which is connected to that
 
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
TANF program and the funding that we
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
receive from the federal government that
 
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
supports the TANF program so we have to
 
01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:51.740 align:start position:0%
uh we're expected to have at least a 50
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
participation rate with individuals who
 
01:01:56.569 --> 01:01:56.579 align:start position:0%
are receiving TANF in order to get that
 
01:01:59.450 --> 01:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
and then the other part of the question
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
was do you have metrics so that we know
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
that the the level of effort we are
 
01:02:08.089 --> 01:02:08.099 align:start position:0%
putting into it is having a positive
 
01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:09.109 align:start position:0%
putting into it is having a positive
outcome

01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
yes we are tracking the individuals and
 
01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:15.559 align:start position:0%
as well as their income uh earned income
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
that they receive from the beginning so
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
we have a Baseline and to what they
 
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
receive throughout the program and then
 
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
when they exit the program or cease to
 
01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
receive TANF
 
01:02:30.049 --> 01:02:30.059 align:start position:0%
about how many people are in this client
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
pool about two thousand about two
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
thousand so that's a pretty nice cross
 
01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
section of currently underemployed or
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
unemployed people have you come across
 
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
any epiphanies on what it's really going
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
to take do we have any magic beans out
 
01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
there to plant to to more aggressively
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
move people uh deeper into their
 
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.289 align:start position:0%
move people uh deeper into their
Workforce

01:02:54.289 --> 01:02:54.299 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:57.059 align:start position:0%
model we're hoping to be able to make
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
this process a lot more efficient and
 
01:03:01.849 --> 01:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
find those magic beans if you will
 
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
um so yeah there are a number of
 
01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
strategies that we're looking at in
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
order to provide these particular
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
services that would
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
um basically not just earn success but
 
01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
would be able to report out on it
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
when might you have a report to tell us
 
01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
what you're discovering like you know
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
maybe Child Care contributes to 24 of
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
the problem substance abuse contributes
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
to 30
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
six percent of the problem it's
 
01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
something that turns into sort of
 
01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
actionable management of or
 
01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
underemployed and that's one of the
 
01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:37.380 align:start position:0%
areas that we want to be able to pursue
 
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
is individuals who may be needing to
 
01:03:44.089 --> 01:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
overcome a substance use dis issue that
 
01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh that they need that kind of support
 
01:03:49.849 --> 01:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
in order to be employed or if there's an
 
01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
individual who wants to become
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
self-employed that's quite an extensive
 
01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
process in order to be able to stand up
 
01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
a new business and be self-employed so
 
01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
this new business model we're really
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
looking to pursue support from a vendor
 
01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
to provide that kind of intensified
 
01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
service and support for our particular
 
01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.650 align:start position:0%
service and support for our particular
population

01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:11.660 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
who want to go down those paths so I
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
would say that we would need a few
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
months to be able to report out on
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
success of that because we're just we
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
haven't started this new business model
 
01:04:25.559 --> 01:04:31.910 align:start position:0%
haven't started this new business model
yet

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
looking across looking across all these
 
01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
programs right if there's roughly 2 000
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
individuals in this last one
 
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
how much commonality is it that people
 
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
are receiving help looking for a job
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
receiving help to find child care right
 
01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:52.099 align:start position:0%
that it's the same pool of people and
 
01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
are we having the impact back to the
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
Chairman's question about metrics are
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
are we actually seeing that these people
 
01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
are moving from right assistance to
 
01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:04.619 align:start position:0%
being self-sufficient
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
and that's an excellent question so I
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
think that you'll see on my last slide
 
01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
what I named our challenges that we have
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
going forward and you know one of those
 
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
challenges is really determining how do
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
we know that people have been successful
 
01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
because of the assistance programs that
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
they have been enrolled in and the
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
services that we've provided them with
 
01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
there is not a really good answer for
 
01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
that so we need to be able to try to
 
01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
what what can we do to make that
 
01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
determination and there's no answer for
 
01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
that yet
 
01:05:41.089 --> 01:05:41.099 align:start position:0%
um so what we've been experiencing of
 
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
uh the programs who are we've been
 
01:05:47.089 --> 01:05:47.099 align:start position:0%
seeing a decline in enrollment uh in
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
TANF in a number of the state
 
01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
supplemental programs in child support
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
in all of these programs we don't know
 
01:05:52.559 --> 01:05:54.230 align:start position:0%
in all of these programs we don't know
why

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
could it be that they're successful
 
01:06:00.049 --> 01:06:00.059 align:start position:0%
that we're actually successfully
 
01:06:02.089 --> 01:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
getting people off of Public Assistance
 
01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:06.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
your comment reminds me of a cartoon I
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
saw yesterday
 
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll do my best to describe it
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
but it's worth sharing right day one at
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
med school and there's a professor in a
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
gown who's pointing and says every
 
01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:24.260 align:start position:0%
healed patient is a lost customer
 
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
and at some point right if we want to be
 
01:06:29.329 --> 01:06:29.339 align:start position:0%
successful the goal is to actually
 
01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
decrease the number of families
 
01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
supporting so that's that's a win if I'm
 
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%
hearing you correctly and I guess what
 
01:06:39.049 --> 01:06:39.059 align:start position:0%
else could we do to help these families
 
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
be on their own yeah starting having
 
01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
been there starting a company is a lot
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
of work done it twice
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
um and it's a it's a good example but
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
what else can we do is is the right
 
01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
metric is the right knob to turn whether
 
01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
it's child care whether it's
 
01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.029 align:start position:0%
it's child care whether it's
supplemental

01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
supplemental
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
Insurance while you're starting a
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
company for instance use that example
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
because buying health insurance is hard
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
so if you have a family and you're
 
01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
starting a company on your own those are
 
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
real world issues that I want to know
 
01:07:10.490 --> 01:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
what what areas where there's a lot of
 
01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:12.299 align:start position:0%
return for investment of time and energy
 
01:07:14.329 --> 01:07:14.339 align:start position:0%
and effort
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
and that is also a great question great
 
01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
questions great direction that we would
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
want to go in order to go there we need
 
01:07:25.069 --> 01:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
research we don't have the ability to do
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
that kind of research and a lot of the
 
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
research may actually be out there but
 
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ability to analyze it
 
01:07:31.849 --> 01:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
so what are the answers and how do we
 
01:07:35.329 --> 01:07:35.339 align:start position:0%
get them how do we know that these
 
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
services are being effective are they
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
just simply underutilized are we not
 
01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
providing the right access or Service
 
01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
delivery for people in order to find out
 
01:07:46.010 --> 01:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
the answers to these questions we would
 
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
need more resources to be able to do
 
01:07:49.849 --> 01:07:49.859 align:start position:0%
that if there are other programs that
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
would provide that success we would need
 
01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
the resources to support those other
 
01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:57.650 align:start position:0%
the resources to support those other
programs

01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm gonna jump ahead and again
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
if are there any questions in here
 
01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:07.140 align:start position:0%
um I I just want to um as as I look
 
01:08:09.049 --> 01:08:09.059 align:start position:0%
through the division of the Bureau of
 
01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:12.299 align:start position:0%
family assistance on pages 14 and 15 I'm
 
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of TANF is this is this
 
01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:20.339 align:start position:0%
predominantly where the rest of the TANF
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
is and then we we have about a hundred
 
01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
percent of what's in hb1 and TANF in
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
these all these sections Mr Ripple
 
01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
yeah in past years the department has
 
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
provided a complete breakdown of all
 
01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
TANF funds throughout the budget uh
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
General and federal alike and I think
 
01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:40.259 align:start position:0%
that's been very helpful to the
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
committee in the past and I'm wondering
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
if it's something you could provide this
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
year as well
 
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
sure we can put that together
 
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.289 align:start position:0%
sure we can put that together
thanks

01:08:48.289 --> 01:08:48.299 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
okay so so one of the thoughts I had on
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
this is I I don't I don't remember the
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
specifics but I think in hb2 we we have
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
some supplemental money to go to TANF to
 
01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
make sure that we meet our level of
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
effort and and sort of this sort of
 
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
confuses me because it it feels like the
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
extent that we want to engage
 
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
our systems we would just go ahead and
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
put whatever TANF money is needed for
 
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
the match or the level of effort into
 
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
hb1 to drive specific programs so that
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
the programs
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
are clearly
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
resourced in a way in which we can track
 
01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
them over time you know budget to budget
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
to budget if we can if we can get the
 
01:09:42.169 --> 01:09:42.179 align:start position:0%
operations you know routinely working
 
01:09:44.809 --> 01:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
and Reporting on the same resourcing
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
that would be good and and I I'm not I'm
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
not really wanting to put tan of
 
01:09:53.329 --> 01:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
supplemental money
 
01:09:57.650 --> 01:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
into hb2 so so my what I'm going to ask
 
01:09:58.970 --> 01:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
you to think about I'm not going to put
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
you on the spot is is is there a way to
 
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
to take the TANF money you need for 32
 
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
million level of effort and invest it in
 
01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
these programs so that these program
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
managers start the fiscal the the budget
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
knowing what they're resourcing are and
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
what what they can accomplish rather
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
than you know I know I'm going to say
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
play a game it's not playing a game I
 
01:10:31.010 --> 01:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
don't mean it to to be dismissive but I
 
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
think division putting in hb2 just
 
01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
dilutes the communication and value of
 
01:10:39.169 --> 01:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
having a budget
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
so um account 6146 906
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
um that that's likely the location that
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
we would put those the three million
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
dollars of Tana funds that's in that's
 
01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
included in HP what's that
 
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
page 906 account 6146 and and so just
 
01:10:59.930 --> 01:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
kind of stepping back a little bit so
 
01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
when the department prepares its agency
 
01:11:03.649 --> 01:11:03.659 align:start position:0%
budget request it has to hit certain
 
01:11:05.209 --> 01:11:05.219 align:start position:0%
Targets this year it was three percent
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
from 23 to 24 and zero percent plus
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
Personnel cost to 25. uh in doing so
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
um we we submitted a couple of
 
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs for those three
 
01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
million dollars of Tana funds that you
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
saw within hb2 it would certainly be our
 
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
preference to include that within HP one
 
01:11:26.689 --> 01:11:26.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay I was still busy chasing the number
 
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
with my eyes and so I missed at least
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
three critical sentences in there that
 
01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
you said so so you would prefer to get
 
01:11:39.649 --> 01:11:39.659 align:start position:0%
the money out of the tan of money out of
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
hb2 to put into hb1 that's your
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
preference at the time you were you had
 
01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to do that you didn't
 
01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
know where to target it but now you have
 
01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:53.219 align:start position:0%
a better idea no no so no we we knew
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
where we wanted to put it but in order
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
to hit the three percent Target we we
 
01:11:59.090 --> 01:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
did not we included that as a
 
01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:00.659 align:start position:0%
prioritized need so during the agency
 
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
phase of the budget rsa94 defines our
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
efficiency expenditure uh Target and
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
that's defined that's we get further
 
01:12:09.229 --> 01:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
guidance from the governor's office in
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
order to hit that we developed those
 
01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
those figures but in order to hit that
 
01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
we were unable to include the additional
 
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
three million dollars of General funds
 
01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
within this division so they went as a
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
prioritized need those during the
 
01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
governor's process that didn't make it
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
into hb1 and it was added as an hb2
 
01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
provision my preference would it would
 
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
be to have that as part of our operating
 
01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:31.910 align:start position:0%
be to have that as part of our operating
budget

01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
okay so do you have something you'd like
 
01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
no it sounds like you could just bring
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
it back from House Bill 2 over to House
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
Bill one and they will show you where
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
they need it to go I I I I I would like
 
01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
to take what you just said and take it a
 
01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
step further and go ahead Mr Ripley you
 
01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
have a comment here yeah I was just
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
noticing that General funds in that
 
01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
accounting unit do go up slightly from
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
22 are they are General funds being used
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
to meet the main the TANF Moe going down
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the budget so TANF funds
 
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
are across a number of accounts and and
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
I I agree Kevin I I think it'd be best
 
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
for me to provide that that sort of
 
01:13:11.689 --> 01:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
account overview but yes we increased uh
 
01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
TANF funds here in order to try to hit
 
01:13:17.209 --> 01:13:17.219 align:start position:0%
that Moe that the 32 the collective 32
 
01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:20.219 align:start position:0%
million dollar mle
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
okay so so you guys are are down in the
 
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
detail better than I am but I would just
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
like to leave you with a an overall task
 
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
to work on an hb1 amendment so we can
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
transfer this out of hp2 into hp1 and
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
that we can allocate it where we think
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to do the most good do you
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
have a comment
 
01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:42.890 align:start position:0%
have a comment
okay

01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
it representative I just want to clarify
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at hb2 it's we're talking
 
01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
about page 82 section 253.
 
01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:54.770 align:start position:0%
about page 82 section 253.
to

01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:59.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
now now by
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
doing what I just asked to move it out
 
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
of hb2 into HP to spread it out into hb1
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
are we also simultaneously reducing that
 
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
other list that you've uh you're
 
01:14:15.229 --> 01:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
preparing for us on your prioritized
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
needs so you would strike it from one of
 
01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
the prioritized needs because we're
 
01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
going to take care of it this way is
 
01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
that is that how that would work uh no
 
01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh it would more so that list that I had
 
01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
sent we'd be adding to that list and and
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
you'd be taking it off of hb1 so it'd be
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
a net reduction on the Surplus the full
 
01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement for hp2 and an
 
01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
increase to the operating budget
 
01:14:41.209 --> 01:14:41.219 align:start position:0%
I see that okay all right good any other
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
questions in here let's go ahead
 
01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.010 align:start position:0%
questions in here let's go ahead
representative

01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
just a quick one so would that mean the
 
01:14:49.729 --> 01:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
FED whether you decide to reallocate
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
that six million dollars across the next
 
01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
two years the federal funds and those
 
01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
accounts would also jump up by twice as
 
01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:55.610 align:start position:0%
accounts would also jump up by twice as
much

01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
no no
 
01:14:59.330 --> 01:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
no because so so this is a maintenance
 
01:15:01.729 --> 01:15:01.739 align:start position:0%
of effort it's not a match
 
01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
um so we already have the the federal
 
01:15:05.689 --> 01:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
dollars budgeted
 
01:15:07.729 --> 01:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
um included here but in order to make
 
01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
sure that next year we don't come up
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
three million short because if we come
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
up 3 million short in in 24 if we don't
 
01:15:17.689 --> 01:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
spend it all then in 25 States we don't
 
01:15:19.729 --> 01:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
spend say we spend 29 million something
 
01:15:23.209 --> 01:15:23.219 align:start position:0%
like that this in 25 instead of getting
 
01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
38 million from the feds would get 35
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
million and then we'd have a 3 million
 
01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
dollar penalty on top of it
 
01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay so I get that part but there's a
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
two-to-one match with the
 
01:15:36.649 --> 01:15:36.659 align:start position:0%
Federal funded General funds for the
 
01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
Tano the mou is not part of that
 
01:15:42.530 --> 01:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
can't be part of that it's a separate
 
01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:43.870 align:start position:0%
can't be part of that it's a separate
thing

01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:47.219 align:start position:0%
so so the the maintenance of let me back
 
01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
up so the maintenance of effort
 
01:15:50.930 --> 01:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
requirement the state collectively
 
01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter which account it's in has
 
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
to spend the 32 million dollars on what
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
on TANF eligible purposes okay you know
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
there are four purposes of TANF it has
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
to meet one of those four
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
okay but also the okay so that's great
 
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
but then you also have the the matching
 
01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
part component there's a federal piece
 
01:16:11.450 --> 01:16:11.460 align:start position:0%
and a general fund piece that's also
 
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
being spent on TANF eligible blah blah
 
01:16:16.189 --> 01:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
blahs right so so the 38 million dollars
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
that we get from the feds if we hit that
 
01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
Moe that the TANF dollars we can use
 
01:16:23.209 --> 01:16:23.219 align:start position:0%
those dollars for those purposes
 
01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
um we also have a TANF reserved I think
 
01:16:27.290 --> 01:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
probably a couple weeks ago we talked
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
about that last I had checked around uh
 
01:16:31.010 --> 01:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the year we had
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
approximately 67 million dollars of TANF
 
01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
federal dollars in our Reserve that
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
could be utilized for TANF eligible
 
01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
purposes as well
 
01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm trying to understand is
 
01:16:44.689 --> 01:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
this Moe is it separate from the two to
 
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
one matching stuff uh there is no match
 
01:16:50.209 --> 01:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
it's a maintenance of effort what's the
 
01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:51.659 align:start position:0%
two to one ratio you mentioned earlier
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:16:57.770 --> 01:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh in here you had mentioned 66 what
 
01:16:59.689 --> 01:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
were we talking about that that was a
 
01:16:59.699 --> 01:17:01.189 align:start position:0%
were we talking about that that was a
separate

01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:17:03.770 --> 01:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that's child support that's
 
01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
child support
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
oh okay okay so TANF is a straight we
 
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
spend this and we'll you'll get that
 
01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:17.689 align:start position:0%
spend this and we'll you'll get that
yes

01:17:17.689 --> 01:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah okay there was a lot of
 
01:17:23.649 --> 01:17:23.659 align:start position:0%
discussion there and I saw some some
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
assertive animation in the audience
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
do any of you feel a compelling need to
 
01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
say something at this point
 
01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
okay all right I don't want anyone
 
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
exploding back there Rebecca Lord and is
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
our is our esteemed Finance director in
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
this area so all right okay
 
01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:43.970 align:start position:0%
this area so all right okay
um

01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
all right so so do you know where we're
 
01:17:48.169 --> 01:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
at because I've jumped around on you and
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
then you took a slide Trail I I think I
 
01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
I think I would just as soon have a skip
 
01:17:56.580 --> 01:18:00.229 align:start position:0%
I think I would just as soon have a skip
forward

01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
um and I can do that so the programs
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
that are on slides 14 and 15 uh these
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
are our
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
State supplemental programs uh many of
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
them until you get to actually really
 
01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.030 align:start position:0%
them until you get to actually really
slide

01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
slide
 
01:18:16.669 --> 01:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
um uh 16 which starts with a community
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
service block grant but 14 and 15 really
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
are those State supplemental programs
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
which some of them do meet TANF Moe and
 
01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
some of the meat Medicaid Moe okay so
 
01:18:29.689 --> 01:18:29.699 align:start position:0%
one of my special subjects this time
 
01:18:34.370 --> 01:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
around are Refugee grants and
 
01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:34.970 align:start position:0%
around are Refugee grants and
um

01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
I I I have worked uh with uh OLS to
 
01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
develop uh an hb2 item that this is to
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
let the division know and to to let you
 
01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
know is that um
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
what what I what I what I what I'd like
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
to do is to
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
recognize it for state that for the
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
federal money going into the refugee
 
01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.630 align:start position:0%
federal money going into the refugee
program

01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:19:06.169 --> 01:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
believing as I do that the term Refugee
 
01:19:08.930 --> 01:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
has been abused in order to open our
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
borders I I would like to do what we can
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
do to protect New Hampshire residents
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
and citizens by uh forever for the State
 
01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:24.290 align:start position:0%
and citizens by uh forever for the State
dollars

01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:26.229 align:start position:0%
dollars
having

01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:19:29.209 --> 01:19:29.219 align:start position:0%
U.S citizens and and New Hampshire
 
01:19:32.330 --> 01:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
residents have
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
first right to any service that does
 
01:19:41.689 --> 01:19:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
and if after
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
fulfilling the needs of our own
 
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
residents if there are still resources
 
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
available at the state level I'm not
 
01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
talking about Federal because the
 
01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
Federal's got their own rules and we
 
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
have to comply with those but just for
 
01:19:59.330 --> 01:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
the state resources
 
01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
if there's resourcing available after
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
taking care of our own residents
 
01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
then I would like to make it you know
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
then we would just go ahead and make
 
01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
that available to the federally
 
01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
you don't have to make a comment on it
 
01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
it's it because this is as much for the
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
division to let you know that this is
 
01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
kind of a controversial thing I don't
 
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
think it is I'm just trying to make sure
 
01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
that as we put money into our social
 
01:20:34.610 --> 01:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
determinants of health programs
 
01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:36.250 align:start position:0%
determinants of health programs
that

01:20:36.250 --> 01:20:36.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
we prioritize the people who've been
 
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
here for years who've been paying in and
 
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
building the system and that anyone
 
01:20:46.689 --> 01:20:46.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
has to wait in their place in the line
 
01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:50.930 align:start position:0%
has to wait in their place in the line
basically

01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
so so that that's going to be an hb2
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
item that we'll end up discussing as
 
01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
division three and that you'll see and
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
and so when you look at it I'd
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if you would take it back
 
01:21:05.450 --> 01:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
to the department and just talk about
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
how you would implement it if it were to
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
become part of hb2 go ahead represent
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
plorsky no I'm just going to clarify
 
01:21:13.610 --> 01:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
that this section we're looking at here
 
01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
with with Refugee grants is 100 Federal
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
money so what were you talking about
 
01:21:19.729 --> 01:21:19.739 align:start position:0%
would not apply here
 
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
you may be right there's another section
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
in here where there was general fund
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
also Associated under a refugee program
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
and I may have gotten myself confused
 
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
yeah it's completely different thing
 
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
there are two are there two different
 
01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
things or is there only one thing that's
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
cool it's a different thing we heard
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
that presentation last week sometime
 
01:21:40.490 --> 01:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
correct yep that was the division of the
 
01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
office of Health Equity office of Health
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
Equity yes oh so everything I said would
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
be wrong today but if we went back in
 
01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:54.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
no no it's always it's always good for
 
01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
somebody to remind me of where I am in
 
01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
the time space continuum thank you
 
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:04.490 align:start position:0%
the time space continuum thank you
um

01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:08.209 --> 01:22:08.219 align:start position:0%
all right so so this kinship Grant and
 
01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
the snap incentive on page 16. I I think
 
01:22:14.570 --> 01:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
I think we have active legislation or
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
issues going on in these areas
 
01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
so could you could you tell us just talk
 
01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
about these two programs sure so that
 
01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
the kinship grant that is an 86 percent
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
generally funded program this is
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
connected with dcyf and the New
 
01:22:33.169 --> 01:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children's trust that provides
 
01:22:36.770 --> 01:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
this program for those kinship families
 
01:22:40.030 --> 01:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
providing services for children or
 
01:22:43.610 --> 01:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
accepting placement of children so that
 
01:22:46.970 --> 01:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
they receive the same supports and
 
01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:48.550 align:start position:0%
they receive the same supports and
information

01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
for navigating all of our systems to in
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
order to
 
01:22:57.410 --> 01:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
take care of those particular children
 
01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:03.250 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:03.260 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
includes there is a prioritized needs
 
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
request that we had for this particular
 
01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
item which is a million dollars per
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 24 and 25. this
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
originated out of Senate Bill 444 in the
 
01:23:19.010 --> 01:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
last session and this is essentially a
 
01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
continuation of that support
 
01:23:23.450 --> 01:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
so what incremental stuff would we be
 
01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
buying with the extra million dollars
 
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
what would we be doing with it that we
 
01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
aren't doing without it
 
01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
so a lot of it would go towards support
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
training for individuals who perhaps
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
need services that have experienced
 
01:23:43.689 --> 01:23:43.699 align:start position:0%
something known as Aces the adult
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood experiences and a lot
 
01:23:51.050 --> 01:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
of after effects that come with that
 
01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
where they really need certain support
 
01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
and Care
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
through our particular systems
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
in taking care of somebody else's
 
01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
children so there's task force involved
 
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
with that there's training that's needed
 
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
educational sessions further supports
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
for these particular adults who are
 
01:24:11.450 --> 01:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
taking care of children that are not
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
so this is this is training for
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
clients as opposed to employees so that
 
01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
these clients can better service it's
 
01:24:25.370 --> 01:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
training and to support services are
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
being provided out of Family Resource
 
01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
Centers I'm sorry I didn't make that
 
01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:29.630 align:start position:0%
Centers I'm sorry I didn't make that
clear

01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
um so the New Hampshire children's trust
 
01:24:36.649 --> 01:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
supports fine the Family Resource
 
01:24:38.290 --> 01:24:38.300 align:start position:0%
Centers around the state
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
so this particular grant program rather
 
01:24:45.229 --> 01:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit would
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
further enhance those particular
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
Services through the New Hampshire
 
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
children's trust to support the
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure of those Family Resource
 
01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:55.610 align:start position:0%
infrastructure of those Family Resource
Centers

01:24:55.610 --> 01:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
the snap incentive program that was
 
01:25:02.209 --> 01:25:02.219 align:start position:0%
originally a program that was created in
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the legislature to support
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
it's 100 General General funds excuse me
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
this is not in the briefing book it is
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
under a million dollars
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's actually a hundred thousand dollars
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
specifically for
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
educational purposes uh and to support
 
01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
incentives for folks who are snap
 
01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
recipients to encourage them to buy
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
healthy foods so it's known as a double
 
01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
up food bucks up to twenty dollars a day
 
01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
you can double the value of your benefit
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
by buying
 
01:25:42.290 --> 01:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
fruits and vegetables and other healthy
 
01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:45.719 align:start position:0%
foods so so this is for um Mr Ripple
 
01:25:45.719 --> 01:25:46.669 align:start position:0%
foods so so this is for um Mr Ripple
maybe

01:25:46.669 --> 01:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:25:46.679 --> 01:25:48.169 align:start position:0%
maybe
um

01:25:48.169 --> 01:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:51.890 --> 01:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
or Mr White but okay so the 40 000 the
 
01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
39 3 that's showing up under 22 was that
 
01:25:59.229 --> 01:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
I wasn't that really under 23 and not 22
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh and and because we we did a
 
01:26:05.209 --> 01:26:05.219 align:start position:0%
supplement to give them like thirty
 
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
and and then as the hundred thousand
 
01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
uh in the next two years
 
01:26:19.729 --> 01:26:19.739 align:start position:0%
is is that what God agreed to when we
 
01:26:24.649 --> 01:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
did that new snap uh authorization
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
or is that higher or lower than what we
 
01:26:28.729 --> 01:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
had agreed I'd have to go back and take
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
a look at the bill so Mr White seems to
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
know something yeah so
 
01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:34.790 align:start position:0%
know something yeah so
um

01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
in in chapter 91 laws of 2021 section
 
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
403 there is an appropriation made for
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
150 000 for this program for the
 
01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:44.990 align:start position:0%
150 000 for this program for the
biennium

01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
so what you're seeing there is you you
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
see in in the first year that was the
 
01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
actual spend
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
um but that's not it's nothing's showing
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
up there in the adjusted authorized I
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
believe because it was an hb2 Provisions
 
01:26:59.209 --> 01:26:59.219 align:start position:0%
so the hundred thousand dollars that you
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
see here
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
um it's a slight increase if you took
 
01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
the 150 and divided by two and added
 
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
um that's included in the governor's
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
recommended budget
 
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
okay I I
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
I I think I I think when I got involved
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
with this last year that we committed to
 
01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
a dollar level and that was agreed upon
 
01:27:21.290 --> 01:27:21.300 align:start position:0%
by all the parties and I would just like
 
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
to see that agreement kept
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
I I think I I think it was a a different
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
number than a hundred thousand each year
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
it was a hundred and fifty thousand
 
01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
dollars for the biennium which is what
 
01:27:35.410 --> 01:27:35.420 align:start position:0%
what was in hb2 for the appropriation
 
01:27:38.649 --> 01:27:38.659 align:start position:0%
okay so this could be this ought to be
 
01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so it there was 50 000
 
01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
appropriated for the for half of one
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and then a hundred thousand
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
for the next fiscal year so because it
 
01:28:00.169 --> 01:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
was a delayed start so
 
01:28:03.410 --> 01:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
it we didn't cover the full first fiscal
 
01:28:05.930 --> 01:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
year right so so what we did was because
 
01:28:10.490 --> 01:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
we had missed last year's uh July to end
 
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
of our beginning of October window for
 
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
the SNAP benefits we put in like thirty
 
01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so you had opportunity
 
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
to get the system up and get anything
 
01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
you needed printed printed get everyone
 
01:28:29.209 --> 01:28:29.219 align:start position:0%
educated and informed so that this year
 
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
on July 1 we would put the money in to
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
actually fund the SNAP benefit that was
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
all one part of one big agreement uh and
 
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just I I wanna
 
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
maybe representative tolersky is going
 
01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
to correct me I'm talking about
 
01:28:48.649 --> 01:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
something totally different but but I I
 
01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
think this was where we made it a
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
specific agreement to provide 30 000 to
 
01:28:56.209 --> 01:28:56.219 align:start position:0%
get the program up in the current year
 
01:28:59.629 --> 01:28:59.639 align:start position:0%
so that we could begin executing it on 1
 
01:29:04.370 --> 01:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
and it's not a lot of money it's already
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
we've already talked about it longer
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
than it's worth but I just I just want
 
01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure that when we make
 
01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
agreements that we keep agreements
 
01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
and this is a place that I'd like to
 
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
come back and look at offline
 
01:29:23.050 --> 01:29:23.060 align:start position:0%
representative or if you have something
 
01:29:24.890 --> 01:29:24.900 align:start position:0%
yes thank you but I don't want to
 
01:29:25.729 --> 01:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
interrupt you because I want to go
 
01:29:25.739 --> 01:29:32.990 align:start position:0%
interrupt you because I want to go
backwards

01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.250 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:36.050 --> 01:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
just a while back we were talking about
 
01:29:37.729 --> 01:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
the Family Resource infrastructure of
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
yes yeah yes it is so we're essentially
 
01:29:48.169 --> 01:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
saying that that would go somewhere in
 
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
in the HP one budget yes yes so the the
 
01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
legislation from the from this past
 
01:29:58.850 --> 01:29:58.860 align:start position:0%
legislative session appropriated one
 
01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:01.139 align:start position:0%
million dollars so this is essentially
 
01:30:03.649 --> 01:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
keeping that appropriation level at the
 
01:30:04.990 --> 01:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
same rate
 
01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what account it would go
 
01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:09.530 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what account it would go
into

01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
they don't tell me right now but can you
 
01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
and there's any reason we shouldn't put
 
01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
that into the HP one again kind of like
 
01:30:16.729 --> 01:30:16.739 align:start position:0%
we talked about with the other one
 
01:30:18.410 --> 01:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
so for that we're looking at accounting
 
01:30:20.330 --> 01:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
unit 7216.
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's just a kinship Grant yeah and I I
 
01:30:25.729 --> 01:30:25.739 align:start position:0%
don't see for from my perspective I
 
01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
don't see any reason not to I would
 
01:30:30.490 --> 01:30:30.500 align:start position:0%
defer to you on that
 
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
it it would be best to have it in the
 
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
operating budget so it's clearer for us
 
01:30:36.290 --> 01:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
to track it from a just you know
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
transparency accounting perspective but
 
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
it it functionally it also works in hb2
 
01:30:43.129 --> 01:30:43.139 align:start position:0%
I've got the functional part but Clarity
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
for me is important too and Stefan hb2
 
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
is completely unclear to me I could
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
never made an association between where
 
01:30:51.890 --> 01:30:51.900 align:start position:0%
it is an hp2 and what it belongs in okay
 
01:30:55.129 --> 01:30:55.139 align:start position:0%
so maybe Mr Ripple you wouldn't mind
 
01:31:00.290 --> 01:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:02.450 --> 01:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:06.470 align:start position:0%
any questions
yeah

01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:09.010 --> 01:31:09.020 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:31:12.169 --> 01:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
we have thrown you completely off not
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
really no can we talk about new heights
 
01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
I think we're still on track and yes
 
01:31:17.689 --> 01:31:17.699 align:start position:0%
we're pretty much there the bureau
 
01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
family assistance uh this particular
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
um group of accounting unit is really
 
01:31:27.169 --> 01:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
all related to field activities uh so
 
01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
the first one is field oh it's known as
 
01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
field eligibility and operations that's
 
01:31:35.330 --> 01:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 7993 which is primarily
 
01:31:38.110 --> 01:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
uh staff who process eligibility
 
01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
applications and redeterminations
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh and making decisions on individuals
 
01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:45.410 align:start position:0%
uh and making decisions on individuals
eligibility

01:31:45.410 --> 01:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
01:31:48.189 --> 01:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
the next accounting unit is New Heights
 
01:31:51.250 --> 01:31:51.260 align:start position:0%
uh number 7214
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
there are various funding sources that
 
01:31:57.649 --> 01:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
when you say
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
7993 is primarily staff it has a huge
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
benefits number in there too doesn't it
 
01:32:10.850 --> 01:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
which would go hand in hand oh they do
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
well Staffing yes
 
01:32:18.290 --> 01:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
if that's for paying your staff
 
01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
so so all the staff members up top I got
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
it okay yeah yeah it's it's on the prior
 
01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
page the the class 10 on page
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
um 913 and then for the Governor's
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
recommend recommended budget there's 358
 
01:32:32.450 --> 01:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
positions here so there's there's quite
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
okay so so yeah go ahead
 
01:32:47.090 --> 01:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
of the 358 what is the current vacancy
 
01:32:49.129 --> 01:32:49.139 align:start position:0%
in that area
 
01:32:52.669 --> 01:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
uh so the vacancy rate for the entire
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
well I can either tell you for the
 
01:32:58.370 --> 01:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
entire Bureau uh which the vacancy rate
 
01:33:02.450 --> 01:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
is 16.3 however I really narrowly look
 
01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
more at the eligibility staff
 
01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
specifically when I'm looking at vacancy
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
rates because that's where a lot of the
 
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
impact is happening right now that
 
01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:25.129 --> 01:33:25.139 align:start position:0%
okay I I gotta ask you my it geeky
 
01:33:27.770 --> 01:33:27.780 align:start position:0%
questions okay new heights is a program
 
01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
and the name of an I.T system both is
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
that true
 
01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
yes it's it's both I refer to new
 
01:33:37.850 --> 01:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
heights they have a whole Administration
 
01:33:40.729 --> 01:33:40.739 align:start position:0%
right that supports the ideal processes
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
correct and the I.T system is also
 
01:33:45.649 --> 01:33:45.659 align:start position:0%
called New Heights correct it's all
 
01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
interchangeable yes okay and so new
 
01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
heights uh was an advance that I think
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
we paid to upgrade in the last budget
 
01:33:56.159 --> 01:33:58.070 align:start position:0%
we paid to upgrade in the last budget
cycle

01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
01:33:58.080 --> 01:33:59.169 align:start position:0%
cycle
um

01:33:59.169 --> 01:33:59.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
has has that upgrade been completed or
 
01:34:06.050 --> 01:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
are we good on uh the upgrade efforts to
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
new heights I I think that is a constant
 
01:34:13.729 --> 01:34:13.739 align:start position:0%
uh with uh enhancements uh that are
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
needed in this particular I.T system
 
01:34:17.209 --> 01:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
this is quite a large system that
 
01:34:19.490 --> 01:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
supports many programs across the
 
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
department including Medicaid
 
01:34:23.629 --> 01:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
Eligibility So when you say supports
 
01:34:26.810 --> 01:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
many programs my understanding is it was
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
intended to support all eligibility
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
efforts within the department yes okay
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
it does okay yes so even though it's
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's kind of located in your area this
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
is a department-wide eligibility service
 
01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
correct it provides a number of other
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
services for programs in the long term
 
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
supports and services Bureau Behavioral
 
01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
Health there's a number of
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
um enhancements that are built into the
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
other systems and other areas of the
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
department that are at the end of their
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
life cycle so so uh this is an I.T
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
questions and Mr weers isn't here but I
 
01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
I'd be curious
 
01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
to know where we are because we did
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
invest in upgrading new heights I and
 
01:35:21.050 --> 01:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
and it was in part because we wanted it
 
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
eligibility across the department
 
01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
and that in doing so the way I remember
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
it is that uh it would take some Legacy
 
01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
systems and let us shut them down and if
 
01:35:38.689 --> 01:35:38.699 align:start position:0%
we shut them down that would have a
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
budgetary impact because we're no longer
 
01:35:44.110 --> 01:35:44.120 align:start position:0%
supporting an expensive Legacy system
 
01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
and so as we look at these budgets on
 
01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
things that we're spending money on it
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
would periodically be nice to see where
 
01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
we can do some Reclamation because we
 
01:35:57.530 --> 01:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
have made good Investments letting us
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
save money elsewhere I I don't have
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
visibility of those unless you think Mr
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
Wieters has already told me and I've
 
01:36:06.770 --> 01:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
forgotten so there are a number so we're
 
01:36:09.169 --> 01:36:09.179 align:start position:0%
doing exactly as you just described okay
 
01:36:09.179 --> 01:36:11.209 align:start position:0%
doing exactly as you just described okay
basically

01:36:11.209 --> 01:36:11.219 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
um like I said replacing a lot of those
 
01:36:17.110 --> 01:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
systems that are Antiquated
 
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
with more efficient processes and be
 
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
able to manage them more efficiently in
 
01:36:25.149 --> 01:36:25.159 align:start position:0%
one contained I.T system
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
so I can get you any more detail about
 
01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
that I can tell you that there are a
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
number of enhancements being made
 
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
currently for long-term supports and
 
01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:35.290 align:start position:0%
currently for long-term supports and
services

01:36:35.290 --> 01:36:35.300 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
as well as a number of covid related
 
01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
enhancements that are needed for federal
 
01:36:40.679 --> 01:36:42.490 align:start position:0%
enhancements that are needed for federal
reporting

01:36:42.490 --> 01:36:42.500 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
ongoing support for the unwind efforts
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
so there are further amendments that are
 
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
currently in process in order to
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
accomplish those tasks there's other
 
01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
reportings related to snap TANF
 
01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
a number of things that I are system
 
01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
techie uh things that I can't describe
 
01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
very well
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:37:08.410 --> 01:37:08.420 align:start position:0%
that's just an ongoing
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
body of work so like I said there are a
 
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
number of enhancements right now there
 
01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
are 36 pending priority projects with
 
01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
new heights that are happening now
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
um but that list is ever
 
01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
so I I guess Mr White I'm not act I
 
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
don't need the data but it would just
 
01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
comfort me to know that somehow within
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
your your processes your budget
 
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
processes you're seeing the unwinding of
 
01:37:43.850 --> 01:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
Legacy systems and the shutdown and the
 
01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
termination of the maintenance tail
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
because that's a way to free up
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
resources that we may put into the
 
01:37:52.850 --> 01:37:52.860 align:start position:0%
budget thinking we need it for two years
 
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
and if you really only need it for six
 
01:37:58.850 --> 01:37:58.860 align:start position:0%
months then you got 18 months to play
 
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
with yep and that's part of our regular
 
01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
process actually came from a meeting
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
earlier where we were looking at our
 
01:38:06.890 --> 01:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
capital projects that were funded and
 
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
asking okay so this we haven't spent a
 
01:38:11.090 --> 01:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
dollar there's thirty thousand dollars
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
left here why why is this still on that
 
01:38:15.110 --> 01:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
why is this still on HP 25 so I mean
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
that that's something that that we go
 
01:38:18.169 --> 01:38:18.179 align:start position:0%
through on a regular basis and Dave
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
Wieters again I mean he's he's the he's
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
driving that ship you know when it comes
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
to managing each one of those projects
 
01:38:27.649 --> 01:38:27.659 align:start position:0%
and works with the finance team
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
to close those out
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
all right very good any questions
 
01:38:36.649 --> 01:38:36.659 align:start position:0%
do you have any sort of final thoughts
 
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
that I may have stepped on that you you
 
01:38:40.490 --> 01:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to say but didn't
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh no I think the final accounting unit
 
01:38:45.530 --> 01:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
uh is the disability determination unit
 
01:38:48.050 --> 01:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
which is in this group which is number
 
01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:50.510 align:start position:0%
which is in this group which is number
7997

01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
7997
 
01:38:53.330 --> 01:38:53.340 align:start position:0%
um this is 62 federally funded
 
01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:55.860 align:start position:0%
uh that's the last accounting unit and
 
01:38:57.290 --> 01:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
then just my last slide that really
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
provides you with the key challenges
 
01:39:01.010 --> 01:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
that we have right now Workforce like
 
01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
everyone is a common uh theme uh that's
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
impacting Service delivery
 
01:39:07.679 --> 01:39:08.330 align:start position:0%
impacting Service delivery
um

01:39:08.330 --> 01:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
we are working very hard for operational
 
01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
Readiness of the Medicaid end of
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid continuous enrollment
 
01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:18.169 align:start position:0%
Medicaid continuous enrollment
um

01:39:18.169 --> 01:39:18.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:21.050 --> 01:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
there the our capacity to manage what's
 
01:39:24.169 --> 01:39:24.179 align:start position:0%
coming is uh and indeterminate at this
 
01:39:24.179 --> 01:39:26.030 align:start position:0%
coming is uh and indeterminate at this
time

01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:39:28.250 --> 01:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
but we're doing our best to try to
 
01:39:32.090 --> 01:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
increase capacity wherever we can
 
01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:32.930 align:start position:0%
increase capacity wherever we can
um

01:39:32.930 --> 01:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
another note that's a challenge to me is
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
that a number of our systems I don't
 
01:39:38.570 --> 01:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
just mean it systems but business
 
01:39:41.209 --> 01:39:41.219 align:start position:0%
process systems that are primarily based
 
01:39:43.370 --> 01:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
on legal compliance which you know
 
01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
rightfully so however Less on
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
person-centric Focus
 
01:39:51.770 --> 01:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
and models which makes Service delivery
 
01:39:54.110 --> 01:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
I think sometimes a bit challenging so
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
really trying to shift uh processes
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
looking at things through a customer
 
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
lens I think is really important
 
01:40:03.649 --> 01:40:03.659 align:start position:0%
um and then of course as we mentioned
 
01:40:06.410 --> 01:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
earlier the need for research and the
 
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
need to understand better about our
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
enrollment a declining enrollment in our
 
01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:21.709 align:start position:0%
enrollment a declining enrollment in our
programs

01:40:21.709 --> 01:40:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:24.169 --> 01:40:24.179 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:40:26.330 --> 01:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
this is probably something we'd say at
 
01:40:28.490 --> 01:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
the end but I just wanted to tell you
 
01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
how much I appreciated you putting the
 
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
budget page number
 
01:40:36.890 --> 01:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
and your hand out and maybe Mr White can
 
01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
advise the other departments to do the
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
same so we're not always trying to
 
01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
figure out what page we're supposed to
 
01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.610 --> 01:41:15.620 align:start position:0%
it's terrible
 
01:41:18.410 --> 01:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
I'm ready okay
 
01:41:20.570 --> 01:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
all right so I need a moment to
 
01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:24.229 align:start position:0%
all right so I need a moment to
transition

01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming appreciate it
 
01:41:30.530 --> 01:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
oh one I do have I'm gonna pull a
 
01:41:33.169 --> 01:41:33.179 align:start position:0%
Columbo on you I do have one more
 
01:41:33.179 --> 01:41:34.370 align:start position:0%
Columbo on you I do have one more
question

01:41:34.370 --> 01:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:41:37.010 --> 01:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
okay so for the division of economic
 
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
stability relative to the entire
 
01:41:41.410 --> 01:41:41.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:41:44.570 --> 01:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
how big a percentage is this division
 
01:41:46.609 --> 01:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
are we talking about 10 percent of the
 
01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
general funds we're talking about some
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
other number
 
01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
01:41:57.770 --> 01:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
if you give me a moment I can pull up a
 
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
document it may just take it okay I'm
 
01:42:03.649 --> 01:42:03.659 align:start position:0%
just trying to get in the ballpark to
 
01:42:11.810 --> 01:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:14.090 --> 01:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
I I could even figure that out if I just
 
01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:23.350 align:start position:0%
I I could even figure that out if I just
looked

01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
so so for division three well Mr White
 
01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:29.219 align:start position:0%
is doing that I think I think we're
 
01:42:31.250 --> 01:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
looking at this document
 
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
is that what we are we're on uh the one
 
01:42:38.930 --> 01:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
title hb2 is introduced for 24.25 dated
 
01:42:43.729 --> 01:42:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:47.330 --> 01:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
well we this is what we were we were we
 
01:42:49.370 --> 01:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
were using this as a cheat sheet we got
 
01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:12.010 --> 01:43:12.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh oh on this chart
 
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so that's about page uh
 
01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:23.510 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so that's about page uh
picks

01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
picks
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
up the hand though she's looking she was
 
01:43:31.010 --> 01:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.050 --> 01:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
where did we leave off you got through
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
Section 226 on page 78 and you'd start
 
01:43:37.729 --> 01:43:37.739 align:start position:0%
off with 227 sure
 
01:43:37.739 --> 01:43:42.050 align:start position:0%
off with 227 sure
yes

01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:48.169 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:43:48.169 --> 01:43:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:48.179 --> 01:44:00.229 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know just take me a minute I I have
 
01:44:11.689 --> 01:44:11.699 align:start position:0%
a table I just want to find it sure
 
01:44:18.229 --> 01:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:18.239 --> 01:44:19.250 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh section 227 on page 78 extends until
 
01:44:25.490 --> 01:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
June 30th of 2025 the Department's
 
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
ability to transfer between personnel
 
01:44:29.209 --> 01:44:29.219 align:start position:0%
class lines with prior approval of the
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and as representative
 
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
pointed out in an email to me earlier
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
today this one has appeared in previous
 
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
trailer bills but I didn't include it in
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
the list that I sent out yesterday
 
01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
so this
 
01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
has been included in four of the last
 
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
six trailer bills it was not included in
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
2013 or 2017 and it has been a little
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
more controversial than some of the
 
01:44:55.250 --> 01:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
other boilerplate sections because it
 
01:44:58.189 --> 01:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
does impact the lapse so most agencies
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
lapse figures come out of their
 
01:45:02.689 --> 01:45:02.699 align:start position:0%
personnel class lines so if you allow
 
01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
departments to transfer between
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
personnel class lines their laps might
 
01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:07.860 align:start position:0%
go down a little bit and that's that's
 
01:45:10.129 --> 01:45:10.139 align:start position:0%
why it was left out in 17. I don't
 
01:45:14.770 --> 01:45:14.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
do you all have any history on that
 
01:45:19.850 --> 01:45:19.860 align:start position:0%
do do you wanna do you want to do
 
01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
anything to try to make this more
 
01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
permanent or are you okay with just
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
I will say I didn't hear you
 
01:45:35.570 --> 01:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
how about we delete it you want to
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
delete it
 
01:45:39.649 --> 01:45:39.659 align:start position:0%
okay I guess I would like to hear maybe
 
01:45:42.649 --> 01:45:42.659 align:start position:0%
Mr White tell us about why this is
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
important to the department to have this
 
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility sure so
 
01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:52.189 align:start position:0%
flexibility sure so
if

01:45:52.189 --> 01:45:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:54.649 --> 01:45:54.659 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry I was multitasking so so
 
01:45:57.770 --> 01:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
we're talking about section 227
 
01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:00.370 align:start position:0%
we're talking about section 227
excellent

01:46:00.370 --> 01:46:00.380 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
01:46:04.370 --> 01:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
so the department is often responding to
 
01:46:07.010 --> 01:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
emerging needs and I mean I can give one
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
more recent example so the senior new
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
Services Center this past fall we were
 
01:46:13.490 --> 01:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
having extreme sapping challenges over
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
there so because we have this ability we
 
01:46:18.530 --> 01:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
were able to transfer those dollars from
 
01:46:21.070 --> 01:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
some of the vacancies because after
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
after this past July when there was uh
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
you know there was an impending closing
 
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
date of March 1st that has since been
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
eliminated we had a I think we lost
 
01:46:32.270 --> 01:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
about 33 percent of our staff so because
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
of that we were because of this
 
01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
provision we were able to transfer funds
 
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
into a contract line and temporarily
 
01:46:40.970 --> 01:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
bringing bring in staff you know through
 
01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
through a contracted provider in order
 
01:46:46.970 --> 01:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
to to bridge that Gap in a temporary way
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
um I mean I think that's just kind of
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
one example of the flexibility that that
 
01:46:52.370 --> 01:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
this gives us
 
01:46:55.129 --> 01:46:55.139 align:start position:0%
um Now flip that around what would the
 
01:46:57.290 --> 01:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
process have looked like if you had not
 
01:46:59.570 --> 01:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
had this flexibility
 
01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:00.950 align:start position:0%
had this flexibility
well

01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:47:03.649 --> 01:47:03.659 align:start position:0%
um any of the dollars in those Personnel
 
01:47:05.149 --> 01:47:05.159 align:start position:0%
lines would have lapsed so it would have
 
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
increased the overall general fund lapse
 
01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:47:13.729 --> 01:47:13.739 align:start position:0%
would have probably either needed to fun
 
01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
find some kind of hp2 provision that
 
01:47:17.689 --> 01:47:17.699 align:start position:0%
appropriated funds for some other
 
01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
purpose take money away from that or
 
01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
amend an existing contract and decrease
 
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
the price limitation and eliminate
 
01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:24.970 align:start position:0%
the price limitation and eliminate
services

01:47:24.970 --> 01:47:24.980 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
or try to piecemeal something together
 
01:47:31.370 --> 01:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
through smaller equipment lines or some
 
01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
other smaller line that that may
 
01:47:37.370 --> 01:47:37.380 align:start position:0%
otherwise potentially lapse or delay
 
01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
some type of purchase that was that was
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
previously approved so so this is what I
 
01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
think I just heard you say I think what
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
I just heard you say was that the need
 
01:47:49.370 --> 01:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
to be able to move money around to fund
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
other personnel
 
01:47:54.410 --> 01:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
it would would not go away what this
 
01:47:59.209 --> 01:47:59.219 align:start position:0%
does is it makes the task of of moving
 
01:48:01.370 --> 01:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
the money transferring the money much
 
01:48:04.189 --> 01:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
more easy much more flexible and and and
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
that gives you more time to focus on
 
01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
other things and that and then if we if
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
in that in the given that we can
 
01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
anticipate serious Workforce issues in
 
01:48:17.689 --> 01:48:17.699 align:start position:0%
the next two years as well this kind of
 
01:48:21.290 --> 01:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
flexibility seems to be as important as
 
01:48:23.870 --> 01:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
it has been in the past two years yeah
 
01:48:26.450 --> 01:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
it it creates a nimbleness and I mean
 
01:48:28.129 --> 01:48:28.139 align:start position:0%
any of these transfers I mean we come
 
01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
through fiscal we present those before
 
01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
um and and it it allows us to be able to
 
01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
respond effectively without with you
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
know without a detriment to any existing
 
01:48:42.770 --> 01:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for specific projects
 
01:48:45.290 --> 01:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
um or or or services or needs
 
01:48:46.970 --> 01:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
um so I I would agree with your
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
statements representable I I it wasn't
 
01:48:51.050 --> 01:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
my state I was just trying to make sure
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
I heard you right you know okay
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
so if this wasn't in the Budget Trailer
 
01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
bill could you still go to fiscal and
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
ask for that permission to transfer
 
01:49:03.950 --> 01:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
between departments or not
 
01:49:09.410 --> 01:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
uh the the Personnel lines yes no so so
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
um if you look at if you look at the
 
01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:12.470 align:start position:0%
um if you look at if you look at the
language

01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:13.129 align:start position:0%
language
um

01:49:13.129 --> 01:49:13.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
so it's it's delaying excuse me
 
01:49:20.050 --> 01:49:20.060 align:start position:0%
it's it's essentially
 
01:49:23.209 --> 01:49:23.219 align:start position:0%
delaying the removal of that Authority
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
um so if and and Kevin please correct me
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong if it's in a class 10 or
 
01:49:29.450 --> 01:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
Class 12 most agencies aren't able to
 
01:49:31.370 --> 01:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
move those funds that's correct other
 
01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:32.629 align:start position:0%
move those funds that's correct other
agencies

01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
are unable to move between personnel
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
class lines
 
01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner for a question
 
01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
I think um representative Edwards
 
01:49:47.450 --> 01:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
actually made the point that um I think
 
01:49:49.490 --> 01:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
the flexibility that the department
 
01:49:53.689 --> 01:49:53.699 align:start position:0%
probably needs to move fairly nimbly
 
01:49:55.370 --> 01:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
and I mean these are sort of like
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
emergencies that come up
 
01:49:59.570 --> 01:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
and you have to transfer staff to from
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
one place to another so that is correct
 
01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
so I mean most recently you know we had
 
01:50:07.129 --> 01:50:07.139 align:start position:0%
Flooding at New Hampshire hospital so we
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
have several hundred thousand dollars of
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
repairs to do as a result of pipes
 
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
bursting when it was negative 40 degree
 
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
wind chill
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
um I mean I think that's just another
 
01:50:17.390 --> 01:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
example because we do have the 24 7
 
01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:19.129 align:start position:0%
example because we do have the 24 7
facilities

01:50:19.129 --> 01:50:19.139 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:50:22.669 --> 01:50:22.679 align:start position:0%
um and then you know I I I think not
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
that everybody want to relive relive
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
this but you know during the pandemic I
 
01:50:27.169 --> 01:50:27.179 align:start position:0%
mean that's just kind of another example
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
of where we had to respond to some type
 
01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
of emerging crisis
 
01:50:34.129 --> 01:50:34.139 align:start position:0%
um and and this Authority allows us to
 
01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
do that effectively and it's not we're
 
01:50:38.330 --> 01:50:38.340 align:start position:0%
not able to move these funds without
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
um you know without fiscal approval so
 
01:50:41.930 --> 01:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
there's still an oversight process there
 
01:50:43.850 --> 01:50:43.860 align:start position:0%
to make sure that whatever we're doing
 
01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm fine I guess I don't see what
 
01:50:58.129 --> 01:50:58.139 align:start position:0%
why DHHS is unique with respect to every
 
01:51:02.090 --> 01:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:03.410 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:51:03.410 --> 01:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:04.629 align:start position:0%
I
um

01:51:04.629 --> 01:51:04.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:08.810 --> 01:51:08.820 align:start position:0%
I find that our our day-to-day business
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and I'm I
 
01:51:13.729 --> 01:51:13.739 align:start position:0%
presents new challenges and new issues
 
01:51:16.729 --> 01:51:16.739 align:start position:0%
uh almost on a regular basis and and I I
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
mean I think you can see that reflected
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
in in the news for For Better or For
 
01:51:20.159 --> 01:51:21.590 align:start position:0%
in in the news for For Better or For
Worse

01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
Worse
 
01:51:24.290 --> 01:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
um there are often a number of emerging
 
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
issues that we have to respond to and
 
01:51:30.169 --> 01:51:30.179 align:start position:0%
um this just allows our department to be
 
01:51:31.250 --> 01:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
able to do that a little bit more
 
01:51:32.810 --> 01:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
effectively and and I would defer to the
 
01:51:34.609 --> 01:51:34.619 align:start position:0%
other agencies on on what their business
 
01:51:35.930 --> 01:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
needs are
 
01:51:37.629 --> 01:51:37.639 align:start position:0%
um I've I've worked in other agencies
 
01:51:40.250 --> 01:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
and I I've certainly found that there
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
has never been a day at the Department
 
01:51:43.010 --> 01:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services in my five
 
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
years there where I'd watch the paint
 
01:51:47.229 --> 01:51:47.239 align:start position:0%
dry on the wall so to speak it is always
 
01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
busy there is always something happening
 
01:51:54.290 --> 01:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
some new issue to respond to
 
01:51:59.570 --> 01:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:02.450 --> 01:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
may you live in interesting times
 
01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:03.770 align:start position:0%
may you live in interesting times
so

01:52:03.770 --> 01:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:52:06.410 --> 01:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
um okay so there was a suggestion to
 
01:52:08.330 --> 01:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
delete it the suggestion to keep it the
 
01:52:11.149 --> 01:52:11.159 align:start position:0%
same I I feel like the consensus is
 
01:52:13.370 --> 01:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
basically this is probably pretty good
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
and of course you're going to caucus on
 
01:52:18.410 --> 01:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
it no but this is probably okay
 
01:52:20.570 --> 01:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:22.430 align:start position:0%
all right
okay

01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:52:25.250 --> 01:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
okay section 229 establishes two
 
01:52:27.590 --> 01:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions and abolishes two
 
01:52:41.090 --> 01:52:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.010 --> 01:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
I guess Java's question is is where and
 
01:52:46.490 --> 01:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
why are they in hp2 sure so um these
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
these are two positions that have had
 
01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:50.030 align:start position:0%
these are two positions that have had
enhancements

01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
enhancements
 
01:52:51.649 --> 01:52:51.659 align:start position:0%
um for a number of years and the
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
division of personnel have actually
 
01:52:55.729 --> 01:52:55.739 align:start position:0%
they've actually requested that that we
 
01:52:57.890 --> 01:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
make these that we make these positions
 
01:53:00.649 --> 01:53:00.659 align:start position:0%
uh unclassified given the nature of
 
01:53:02.810 --> 01:53:02.820 align:start position:0%
their work it's it's a it's within the
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
vision of Medicaid services it's a
 
01:53:06.050 --> 01:53:06.060 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Pharmacy director in the in the
 
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical service specialist
 
01:53:10.129 --> 01:53:10.139 align:start position:0%
um they're a little unique when looking
 
01:53:13.129 --> 01:53:13.139 align:start position:0%
at the classified system and and based
 
01:53:15.290 --> 01:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
on the kind of the the workload hours
 
01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
worked and the salary schedules
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
um this this was a recommendation from
 
01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
the division of personnel because again
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
we have to go back through and I think
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
we've been going I don't quote me on
 
01:53:25.729 --> 01:53:25.739 align:start position:0%
this but I think for close to 10 years
 
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
through GNC to get these constant
 
01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:29.820 align:start position:0%
enhancements to make them competitive
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
with the market
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
so do you have an account number
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the name
 
01:53:37.970 --> 01:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
and are you saying they cannot be in the
 
01:53:41.330 --> 01:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
budget because of these specials so so
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
what this would do is this would
 
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
transfer the funds and and I I can look
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
it up
 
01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
um this would transfer the funds from
 
01:53:53.450 --> 01:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
class 10 to class 12 to an unclassified
 
01:53:53.460 --> 01:53:55.609 align:start position:0%
class 10 to class 12 to an unclassified
position

01:53:55.609 --> 01:53:55.619 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:53:57.470 --> 01:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
and and it would also convert them into
 
01:54:01.250 --> 01:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
this in the system to unclassified right
 
01:54:02.570 --> 01:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't have to be in there every
 
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
biennium or can it just be something
 
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
that's done this if you if you approved
 
01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
this language here this would be one and
 
01:54:11.689 --> 01:54:11.699 align:start position:0%
done then you never see it again okay
 
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:16.609 --> 01:54:16.619 align:start position:0%
and you need to have apparently some
 
01:54:19.490 --> 01:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
statutory authorization to make a
 
01:54:21.890 --> 01:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
conversion to unclassified and this
 
01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
would be it rather than a separate bill
 
01:54:27.590 --> 01:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's 100 correct yes all right
 
01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:28.910 align:start position:0%
that's 100 correct yes all right
next

01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:54:31.250 --> 01:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
and likewise
 
01:54:33.169 --> 01:54:33.179 align:start position:0%
section 230 establishes certain
 
01:54:35.450 --> 01:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions and abolishes
 
01:54:38.450 --> 01:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
certain certain classified positions and
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
appropriates funds
 
01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
in each year of the biennials
 
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
so I would think representative hole you
 
01:54:47.810 --> 01:54:47.820 align:start position:0%
would like these because this is doing
 
01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
what you thought intuitively we needed
 
01:54:52.750 --> 01:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
to do is to move more positions from
 
01:54:55.970 --> 01:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
classified to unclassified
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
having having reviewed the organization
 
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
chart under the commissioner I think all
 
01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
of these are direct reports up through
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
the legal department at for these but I
 
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
was thinking far more broadly than that
 
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
than just
 
01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
right the entire staff within the legal
 
01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:15.050 align:start position:0%
right the entire staff within the legal
department

01:55:15.050 --> 01:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
other than the administrative admin
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
positions so your position would be this
 
01:55:22.669 --> 01:55:22.679 align:start position:0%
is necessary but really not sufficient
 
01:55:22.679 --> 01:55:24.830 align:start position:0%
is necessary but really not sufficient
probably

01:55:24.830 --> 01:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
I think it's a start I don't know and
 
01:55:31.729 --> 01:55:31.739 align:start position:0%
we'd have to ask questions regarding
 
01:55:34.729 --> 01:55:34.739 align:start position:0%
how much overtime what's right some of
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
these C varying workloads there's
 
01:55:39.050 --> 01:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
there's a an ongoing case right now
 
01:55:42.050 --> 01:55:42.060 align:start position:0%
against the the state for prior synonym
 
01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
and YDC
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
abuse cases I don't know if this is all
 
01:55:49.609 --> 01:55:49.619 align:start position:0%
being farmed through outside resources
 
01:55:51.649 --> 01:55:51.659 align:start position:0%
from legal department or if if this is
 
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
being managed internally with these 30
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
attorneys and
 
01:55:58.970 --> 01:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
how that it would impact the budget
 
01:55:58.980 --> 01:56:00.229 align:start position:0%
how that it would impact the budget
sure

01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
um so I I would have to bring Melissa
 
01:56:03.649 --> 01:56:03.659 align:start position:0%
sincere into
 
01:56:05.930 --> 01:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
um she's our chief legal officer I I
 
01:56:08.510 --> 01:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
would need to bring her in um to speak
 
01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
to some of those specifics but but again
 
01:56:14.090 --> 01:56:14.100 align:start position:0%
what what this is doing is we have a
 
01:56:17.390 --> 01:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
number of classified attorney positions
 
01:56:20.450 --> 01:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
um their workloads are often their work
 
01:56:22.729 --> 01:56:22.739 align:start position:0%
hours you know are often driven by the
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
cases so sometimes they have to be in
 
01:56:25.970 --> 01:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
court all day and then prepare a brief
 
01:56:28.129 --> 01:56:28.139 align:start position:0%
for the subsequent day
 
01:56:30.590 --> 01:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
um and and that's part of the reason and
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Justice had had
 
01:56:34.490 --> 01:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
recommended that we take this approach
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
as well with these particular positions
 
01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
um because if you work you know if you
 
01:56:41.810 --> 01:56:41.820 align:start position:0%
work 45 hours every week you earn a
 
01:56:43.250 --> 01:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
bunch of comp time you never can
 
01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
actually take that comp time and then we
 
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
you know have to make a payment at some
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
point for that so this was a
 
01:56:51.590 --> 01:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation by them and in order to
 
01:56:54.890 --> 01:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
give them the the flexibility to
 
01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
um to to manage their their hours in
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
such a way I've believe many of the
 
01:57:01.850 --> 01:57:01.860 align:start position:0%
cases that you're referencing
 
01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative whole the Department of
 
01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
Justice represents the state but then uh
 
01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
various attorneys across the legal the
 
01:57:10.270 --> 01:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
legal team
 
01:57:12.649 --> 01:57:12.659 align:start position:0%
provide assistance with any requests
 
01:57:15.169 --> 01:57:15.179 align:start position:0%
resulting from from that litigation
 
01:57:15.179 --> 01:57:16.550 align:start position:0%
resulting from from that litigation
so

01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:19.010 --> 01:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
represent waller or did you have a
 
01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:20.810 align:start position:0%
represent waller or did you have a
follow-up

01:57:20.810 --> 01:57:20.820 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:22.129 align:start position:0%
follow-up
okay

01:57:22.129 --> 01:57:22.139 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:57:24.649 --> 01:57:24.659 align:start position:0%
I just wondered if the attorneys listed
 
01:57:26.450 --> 01:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
here as having
 
01:57:28.609 --> 01:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
being reclassified
 
01:57:28.619 --> 01:57:29.689 align:start position:0%
being reclassified
um

01:57:29.689 --> 01:57:29.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
to unclassified
 
01:57:34.129 --> 01:57:34.139 align:start position:0%
realize that this is happening
 
01:57:36.410 --> 01:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
I would need to talk to Melissa sincere
 
01:57:38.209 --> 01:57:38.219 align:start position:0%
about what kind of communication plan is
 
01:57:41.810 --> 01:57:41.820 align:start position:0%
in place okay thank you
 
01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:43.010 align:start position:0%
in place okay thank you
I

01:57:43.010 --> 01:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
if you have more to add I'm generally
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay with that
 
01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:52.370 align:start position:0%
okay with that
correct

01:57:52.370 --> 01:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
okay so if no one if somebody's not okay
 
01:57:57.649 --> 01:57:57.659 align:start position:0%
with that you know let me know but it
 
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
seems okay uh
 
01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:02.270 align:start position:0%
seems okay uh
231

01:58:02.270 --> 01:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
231
 
01:58:05.330 --> 01:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
231 establishes that no admissions to
 
01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
the forensic psychiatric hospital shall
 
01:58:10.189 --> 01:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
occur until after June 30th 2025 unless
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:15.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:17.639 align:start position:0%
that's that's a blinding flash of the
 
01:58:20.089 --> 01:58:20.099 align:start position:0%
obvious why why does that need to be in
 
01:58:20.099 --> 01:58:27.729 align:start position:0%
obvious why why does that need to be in
law

01:58:27.729 --> 01:58:27.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
it it essentially does what it does
 
01:58:33.169 --> 01:58:33.179 align:start position:0%
um I mean I I don't think it's necessary
 
01:58:35.450 --> 01:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
the facility probably at this point
 
01:58:38.930 --> 01:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
won't be built until mid-2025 so we're
 
01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
really not looking at the fall
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
um and or you know the potentially early
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
winter of the subsequent biennium we
 
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
don't have any funding uh for personnel
 
01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:49.790 align:start position:0%
don't have any funding uh for personnel
so

01:58:49.790 --> 01:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:52.669 --> 01:58:52.679 align:start position:0%
this could go it could stay
 
01:58:55.990 --> 01:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's just sort of under my my general
 
01:59:00.410 --> 01:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
desire to get hb2 skinnier
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
I if if it isn't necessary I just didn't
 
01:59:06.609 --> 01:59:06.619 align:start position:0%
get rid of it it doesn't feel necessary
 
01:59:10.970 --> 01:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:13.850 --> 01:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
I mean I I don't know if I look at it I
 
01:59:16.490 --> 01:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
would think would it
 
01:59:20.330 --> 01:59:20.340 align:start position:0%
may have been there for us if by chance
 
01:59:24.050 --> 01:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
some miracle the building was
 
01:59:27.950 --> 01:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
completed in January of 25.
 
01:59:30.589 --> 01:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
that because you would have no budget to
 
01:59:32.209 --> 01:59:32.219 align:start position:0%
run it you would have no operational
 
01:59:35.649 --> 01:59:35.659 align:start position:0%
budget no one would be committed there
 
01:59:38.510 --> 01:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
that is correct that's what just
 
01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
anticipated right that it might have
 
01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:42.719 align:start position:0%
gotten finished with no when there was
 
01:59:45.229 --> 01:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
no budget in place yes or early on in
 
01:59:47.149 --> 01:59:47.159 align:start position:0%
our agency requests we were anticipating
 
01:59:49.609 --> 01:59:49.619 align:start position:0%
an earlier opening date
 
01:59:51.649 --> 01:59:51.659 align:start position:0%
um that has not that will not be the
 
01:59:54.290 --> 01:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
case and so we sent zeroed out uh the
 
02:00:04.370 --> 02:00:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
all right so so I'd like to just mark
 
02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:08.130 align:start position:0%
this for deletion
 
02:00:08.130 --> 02:00:09.490 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
unless it doesn't make sense but right
 
02:00:17.570 --> 02:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:20.209 --> 02:00:20.219 align:start position:0%
32 states that the department shall be
 
02:00:21.890 --> 02:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
able to carry forward funds from fiscal
 
02:00:23.570 --> 02:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
23 in the developmental Services
 
02:00:25.729 --> 02:00:25.739 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorder and In-Home
 
02:00:27.890 --> 02:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
Support funds and I would just note that
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
this ability is already authorized by
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
RSA 171 a8b which makes each of those
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
three funds non-lapsing and continually
 
02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:44.330 --> 02:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
just so the takeaway is this is already
 
02:00:47.209 --> 02:00:47.219 align:start position:0%
in law and this uh the the this section
 
02:00:50.089 --> 02:00:50.099 align:start position:0%
might be redundant it seems that way to
 
02:00:51.290 --> 02:00:51.300 align:start position:0%
me I don't know if Nathan has a
 
02:00:54.109 --> 02:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:57.410 --> 02:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
so it
 
02:00:59.689 --> 02:00:59.699 align:start position:0%
the funds that are the the dollars that
 
02:01:01.490 --> 02:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
are that are continually appropriated to
 
02:01:03.229 --> 02:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
these funds and and Kevin I don't know
 
02:01:05.689 --> 02:01:05.699 align:start position:0%
if you know the answer they are General
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
funds um we're currently projecting
 
02:01:10.910 --> 02:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
about a 55 million dollar carry forward
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
um in the in the DD account
 
02:01:17.089 --> 02:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
um how that would be represented within
 
02:01:19.790 --> 02:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
this budget is is kind of an open
 
02:01:22.189 --> 02:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
question whether we would need these
 
02:01:25.850 --> 02:01:25.860 align:start position:0%
funds for 2024 and whether we would need
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
this explicit language is kind of an
 
02:01:29.089 --> 02:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
open question because typically when we
 
02:01:30.050 --> 02:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
have a continually appropriated
 
02:01:32.689 --> 02:01:32.699 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund like a revolving fund
 
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
we have a very we have a specific
 
02:01:36.229 --> 02:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
funding source and typically that's
 
02:01:38.570 --> 02:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
non-general funds
 
02:01:40.910 --> 02:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
so in each case the statute reads the
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
fund from Appropriations provided in and
 
02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
then it names the accounting unit shall
 
02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
be used to carry out the provision of
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
this chapter the fund shall be
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing and continually appropriated
 
02:01:51.890 --> 02:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
to the department so to me it seems
 
02:01:53.330 --> 02:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
clear that from whatever Source
 
02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
they're known
 
02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
it seems to be sorry it seems to me that
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
this language isn't needed
 
02:02:06.589 --> 02:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
so so with that I I would lean to
 
02:02:09.890 --> 02:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
wanting us to delete this hb2 item and
 
02:02:12.109 --> 02:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
give the department an opportunity to
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
come back to us and say no no no we
 
02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
really need that
 
02:02:19.370 --> 02:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like the the statute's
 
02:02:20.930 --> 02:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
already in place
 
02:02:22.850 --> 02:02:22.860 align:start position:0%
the statute is in place and I can send
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
out a link to this to everybody so they
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
can read it for themselves
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
um I would note that including it
 
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt anything it might be
 
02:02:32.810 --> 02:02:32.820 align:start position:0%
redundant at most but it doesn't hurt
 
02:02:35.470 --> 02:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
anything so so that itself is hurtful
 
02:02:39.530 --> 02:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't know waste let's be
 
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
clean go ahead represent but somebody
 
02:02:45.470 --> 02:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
must have thought there was a reason for
 
02:02:48.169 --> 02:02:48.179 align:start position:0%
this to be here and I guess I'd like to
 
02:02:48.179 --> 02:02:49.129 align:start position:0%
this to be here and I guess I'd like to
hear

02:02:49.129 --> 02:02:49.139 align:start position:0%
hear
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
what they were what what was what were
 
02:02:54.530 --> 02:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
they thinking when somebody wanted
 
02:02:57.050 --> 02:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted this in here yeah I
 
02:02:58.669 --> 02:02:58.679 align:start position:0%
think the governor woke up one night and
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
said oh let's do this
 
02:03:02.570 --> 02:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
I mean when when we were looking at this
 
02:03:04.370 --> 02:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make sure that it was
 
02:03:06.290 --> 02:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear that we would be able
 
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
to carry forward those funds and and
 
02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:09.770 align:start position:0%
to carry forward those funds and and
again

02:03:09.770 --> 02:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:03:11.390 --> 02:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
um typically our non-laps and
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
continually appropriate funds have a
 
02:03:14.990 --> 02:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
fixed funding source so like Governor's
 
02:03:17.209 --> 02:03:17.219 align:start position:0%
commission they have they have a fixed
 
02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
fund or they have a funding source
 
02:03:20.570 --> 02:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
depending on the year
 
02:03:22.129 --> 02:03:22.139 align:start position:0%
um they have a funding source that is
 
02:03:23.450 --> 02:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
separate from the general funds and we
 
02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
just want to make it abundantly clear
 
02:03:25.850 --> 02:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
that those General funds would be
 
02:03:29.089 --> 02:03:29.099 align:start position:0%
available so that when we send a memo to
 
02:03:31.010 --> 02:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
das to carry those funds forward in the
 
02:03:33.050 --> 02:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
next year there were no questions asked
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:58.550 --> 02:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:00.890 --> 02:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
the county cap
 
02:04:04.250 --> 02:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
section 233 on page 80 caps County
 
02:04:06.169 --> 02:04:06.179 align:start position:0%
Billings for long-term care services at
 
02:04:10.250 --> 02:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
134.5 million and 24 and 137.2 million
 
02:04:13.129 --> 02:04:13.139 align:start position:0%
and 25 and those numbers reflect uh two
 
02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
percent increase of year over year
 
02:04:18.649 --> 02:04:18.659 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion that I made the other
 
02:04:20.450 --> 02:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
day was that we just freeze it at the
 
02:04:24.350 --> 02:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
I I think I'm good with that and uh I I
 
02:04:30.530 --> 02:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
had a conversation earlier with Mr
 
02:04:33.649 --> 02:04:33.659 align:start position:0%
Ripple and it sounded like
 
02:04:37.310 --> 02:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
we needed to find about 18 and a half
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars to kind of make this
 
02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
happen it's not in the governor's budget
 
02:04:45.169 --> 02:04:45.179 align:start position:0%
so as you recall there was a discrepancy
 
02:04:47.169 --> 02:04:47.179 align:start position:0%
between House Bill 2 and House Bill one
 
02:04:49.729 --> 02:04:49.739 align:start position:0%
so the figures appropriated in house
 
02:04:52.370 --> 02:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
bill one were short of what you would
 
02:04:54.350 --> 02:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
need for the house bill 2 language so I
 
02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
think there's a technical fix of about
 
02:04:57.589 --> 02:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
10 and a half million dollars that would
 
02:04:59.810 --> 02:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
need to be done no matter what and then
 
02:05:01.370 --> 02:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
there's another eight million dollars to
 
02:05:08.450 --> 02:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:11.089 --> 02:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
is anyone opposed to finding the 18 and
 
02:05:14.149 --> 02:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
a half million dollars to to execute
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
this hb2 line item
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
I like the idea of freezing it I think
 
02:05:21.770 --> 02:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea
 
02:05:24.410 --> 02:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
um but I would want to see where we're
 
02:05:25.970 --> 02:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
going to find
 
02:05:28.010 --> 02:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
I want to be sure I know where where
 
02:05:30.310 --> 02:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
we're finding this 18 million
 
02:05:32.570 --> 02:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
I think we should put it on a list of
 
02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
things we want to do
 
02:05:36.830 --> 02:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
and we'll have to balance it against
 
02:05:40.070 --> 02:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
things we might not want to do so so Mr
 
02:05:42.050 --> 02:05:42.060 align:start position:0%
Ripple and I rehearse that for the first
 
02:05:45.830 --> 02:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
time today and and I I I think there's a
 
02:05:47.870 --> 02:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
method for us to to do what you just
 
02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:49.370 align:start position:0%
method for us to to do what you just
asked

02:05:49.370 --> 02:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
asked
 
02:05:51.709 --> 02:05:51.719 align:start position:0%
um I don't have it scheduled yet oh okay
 
02:05:52.970 --> 02:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
I was going to say are you going to
 
02:05:54.589 --> 02:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
share or you're just going to give it to
 
02:05:56.810 --> 02:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
yourself I'm the open and transparent
 
02:05:59.870 --> 02:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:05.450 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:06:05.450 --> 02:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:07.850 --> 02:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
all right so so I think I think we're
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
aligned on this
 
02:06:15.050 --> 02:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.930 --> 02:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
okay section 234 on page 80 appropriates
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
funds the choices for Independence
 
02:06:19.679 --> 02:06:23.149 align:start position:0%
funds the choices for Independence
program

02:06:23.149 --> 02:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:25.850 --> 02:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
can I ask a question
 
02:06:28.729 --> 02:06:28.739 align:start position:0%
so can you explain to me
 
02:06:30.410 --> 02:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
how this
 
02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
um this is above and beyond
 
02:06:35.570 --> 02:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
the three percent
 
02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:37.370 align:start position:0%
the three percent
correct

02:06:37.370 --> 02:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:06:39.770 --> 02:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
and do we have a way of knowing where
 
02:06:41.089 --> 02:06:41.099 align:start position:0%
this gets
 
02:06:43.070 --> 02:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
um I want to try to figure out where
 
02:06:45.050 --> 02:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
this gets them to
 
02:06:49.550 --> 02:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
sure so what you're seeing here again
 
02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
similar to some of the other issues that
 
02:06:53.209 --> 02:06:53.219 align:start position:0%
we've seen it's kind of a function of us
 
02:06:55.370 --> 02:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
trying to hit that three percent and
 
02:06:57.050 --> 02:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
then we had leftover prior I don't call
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
them left over we had prioritized needs
 
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
outside of that and then
 
02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
um these were the amounts that that were
 
02:07:06.589 --> 02:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
appropriated in hb2 and so the dollars
 
02:07:10.070 --> 02:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
here um these are based on
 
02:07:11.629 --> 02:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
um these would ensure that we have
 
02:07:14.930 --> 02:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
adequate funds to provide services for
 
02:07:17.810 --> 02:07:17.820 align:start position:0%
existing levels as well as additional
 
02:07:21.649 --> 02:07:21.659 align:start position:0%
projected service level needs
 
02:07:23.930 --> 02:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
but does that mean you're talking about
 
02:07:27.290 --> 02:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
additional services but not necessarily
 
02:07:28.970 --> 02:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
a rate increase
 
02:07:30.649 --> 02:07:30.659 align:start position:0%
additional service is not a rate
 
02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
increase yes here yep
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
and this is the group that can't hire
 
02:07:37.850 --> 02:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
anybody to
 
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
02:07:41.629 --> 02:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
I'm having a hard time understanding how
 
02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
they're going to provide additional
 
02:07:43.199 --> 02:07:44.510 align:start position:0%
they're going to provide additional
services

02:07:44.510 --> 02:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:07:47.870 --> 02:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
when their rate is so low they can they
 
02:07:50.149 --> 02:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
can hardly hire anybody so that's not
 
02:07:51.530 --> 02:07:51.540 align:start position:0%
for you to
 
02:07:54.589 --> 02:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
just just a comment
 
02:07:57.530 --> 02:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
so this is one place we could find funds
 
02:08:01.729 --> 02:08:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
e i okay so so I may be wrong but my
 
02:08:07.609 --> 02:08:07.619 align:start position:0%
reaction to this was just a little bit
 
02:08:10.970 --> 02:08:10.980 align:start position:0%
different my my reaction is that I think
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
in general the CFI program is is a good
 
02:08:17.330 --> 02:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
investment other than what
 
02:08:19.129 --> 02:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner just pointed out
 
02:08:21.470 --> 02:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
is that you can throw money at something
 
02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
without the people to execute it if we
 
02:08:25.490 --> 02:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
don't change the rates we're not going
 
02:08:27.410 --> 02:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
to end up spending on extra Services
 
02:08:29.870 --> 02:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
anyways I I think that was your your
 
02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:31.910 align:start position:0%
anyways I I think that was your your
observation

02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
observation
 
02:08:36.189 --> 02:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
um I I my thought on that would be
 
02:08:39.890 --> 02:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
putting aside that practical problem I'd
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
rather see this principally
 
02:08:47.330 --> 02:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
to put into hb1 instead of hb2 just put
 
02:08:49.370 --> 02:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
the money into the operational budget
 
02:08:49.380 --> 02:08:50.689 align:start position:0%
the money into the operational budget
and

02:08:50.689 --> 02:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:53.450 --> 02:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
and let the people who execute that
 
02:08:55.970 --> 02:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
program know what they've got
 
02:08:58.250 --> 02:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
so but if you can't spend it you know
 
02:09:00.890 --> 02:09:00.900 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes need it they can spend
 
02:09:00.900 --> 02:09:01.790 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes need it they can spend
it

02:09:01.790 --> 02:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:09:06.589 --> 02:09:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:06.599 --> 02:09:08.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:09:08.450 --> 02:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
so what would this instead of additional
 
02:09:12.719 --> 02:09:13.910 align:start position:0%
so what would this instead of additional
services

02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
what would this Tran Translate to
 
02:09:21.169 --> 02:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
in if we used it as a rate increase for
 
02:09:24.589 --> 02:09:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:27.169 --> 02:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
I I don't know off the top of my head so
 
02:09:29.629 --> 02:09:29.639 align:start position:0%
so so if we took the full roughly 15
 
02:09:33.109 --> 02:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars instead of instead of
 
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
maintaining the service levels today for
 
02:09:36.770 --> 02:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
the next biennium
 
02:09:39.850 --> 02:09:39.860 align:start position:0%
increase that by the equivalent amount
 
02:09:42.649 --> 02:09:42.659 align:start position:0%
is that that's the request correct yes
 
02:09:45.290 --> 02:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
sure um yeah we can
 
02:09:47.450 --> 02:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
I I can come up with a figure
 
02:09:50.270 --> 02:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
and and get that get that to you okay I
 
02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:51.410 align:start position:0%
and and get that get that to you okay I
mean

02:09:51.410 --> 02:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
I think that yeah
 
02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
you could take the money and put it at
 
02:09:55.970 --> 02:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
the nursing give it to the nursing homes
 
02:09:57.890 --> 02:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
but nursing homes cost
 
02:10:00.709 --> 02:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
so much more we're doing this is such a
 
02:10:00.719 --> 02:10:02.089 align:start position:0%
so much more we're doing this is such a
better

02:10:02.089 --> 02:10:02.099 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
way of providing Services it's it's a
 
02:10:07.129 --> 02:10:07.139 align:start position:0%
lot less expensive to keep someone in
 
02:10:10.729 --> 02:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
their own home with help than to have to
 
02:10:12.530 --> 02:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
go to an expensive nursing home I just
 
02:10:14.209 --> 02:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
saw a nursing home budget this morning
 
02:10:17.169 --> 02:10:17.179 align:start position:0%
in Merrimack County I mean we're talking
 
02:10:22.129 --> 02:10:22.139 align:start position:0%
200 to 250 000 a year per person
 
02:10:24.890 --> 02:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
so so I think these are two distinct
 
02:10:27.830 --> 02:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
issues two distinct issues they are we
 
02:10:30.169 --> 02:10:30.179 align:start position:0%
we and and maybe we should keep them
 
02:10:33.290 --> 02:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
separate a little longer to say we we
 
02:10:35.629 --> 02:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
we're I think we're committed to trying
 
02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
to keep the county cap as it was and
 
02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
that we have to find the 18 and a half
 
02:10:42.129 --> 02:10:42.139 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative erf is correctly observed
 
02:10:46.490 --> 02:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
that maybe this is a source of that
 
02:10:48.530 --> 02:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
money but this is a different issue this
 
02:10:51.649 --> 02:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
issue is should we invest in CFI I think
 
02:10:56.149 --> 02:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
and CFI is a good investment so so if we
 
02:10:59.209 --> 02:10:59.219 align:start position:0%
are going to invest in CFI
 
02:11:03.109 --> 02:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
I would rather have it in hb1 instead of
 
02:11:05.330 --> 02:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
as hb2
 
02:11:08.270 --> 02:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
do you have a problem with that
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
I agree with you okay so so I I I want
 
02:11:14.030 --> 02:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
to hear you go ahead
 
02:11:16.250 --> 02:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
sorry to make a comment I I have no
 
02:11:18.050 --> 02:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
problem what you just said but I would
 
02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
point out that now you're talking about
 
02:11:21.410 --> 02:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
basically adjusting rates for one
 
02:11:21.420 --> 02:11:23.149 align:start position:0%
basically adjusting rates for one
particular

02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:11:25.189 --> 02:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
piece of the whole of the whole budget
 
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
and we sort of talked about that's not
 
02:11:28.370 --> 02:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
really the right way to go about this so
 
02:11:30.530 --> 02:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
I I get the CFI thing I also like to see
 
02:11:32.270 --> 02:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
a bad thing I think the program's great
 
02:11:33.470 --> 02:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand if you can't get
 
02:11:35.209 --> 02:11:35.219 align:start position:0%
people to do it then it's just money
 
02:11:37.250 --> 02:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
that sits there and doesn't get put to
 
02:11:40.250 --> 02:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
use right so I think I think we're all
 
02:11:43.070 --> 02:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
also aligned on the idea that throwing
 
02:11:45.290 --> 02:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
money at the same rate we're not going
 
02:11:47.810 --> 02:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
to probably move the needle much on the
 
02:11:49.550 --> 02:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
total amount of services and we're going
 
02:11:51.250 --> 02:11:51.260 align:start position:0%
to end up
 
02:11:53.810 --> 02:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
isolating the money and turn it into a
 
02:11:56.450 --> 02:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
lapse I think I think that's generally
 
02:11:58.250 --> 02:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
all agreed on
 
02:12:01.550 --> 02:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
to your idea though about targeting
 
02:12:04.850 --> 02:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
rate hikes this is the project that
 
02:12:06.770 --> 02:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham has been
 
02:12:09.109 --> 02:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
working on that I'd like him to brief us
 
02:12:11.209 --> 02:12:11.219 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday where he's at
 
02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
and and if Mr White can give us a little
 
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
bit better data about you know taking
 
02:12:21.649 --> 02:12:21.659 align:start position:0%
let's say it's a hundred dollars that we
 
02:12:24.050 --> 02:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
want to add to this and instead of doing
 
02:12:25.729 --> 02:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
a hundred dollars thinking we're going
 
02:12:28.189 --> 02:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
to get a hundred dollars of services it
 
02:12:29.629 --> 02:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
really needs to be
 
02:12:29.639 --> 02:12:31.970 align:start position:0%
really needs to be
increase

02:12:31.970 --> 02:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:12:33.410 --> 02:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
the rate
 
02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
by 60 so that we can go spend 40
 
02:12:41.149 --> 02:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
on on more services you know I there's
 
02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
there's a formula in there I I think
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
you're going to come back with a rate
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation on this if I if I heard
 
02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:51.599 align:start position:0%
you right I I can come back with with a
 
02:12:53.629 --> 02:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
number so if you took the 15 million
 
02:12:56.270 --> 02:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
dollars that was intended to fund both
 
02:12:59.089 --> 02:12:59.099 align:start position:0%
existing service levels and additional
 
02:13:00.890 --> 02:13:00.900 align:start position:0%
projected needs so there would be a
 
02:13:03.229 --> 02:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
potential reduction in Services what
 
02:13:04.850 --> 02:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
that would equate to
 
02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
in a rate increase
 
02:13:08.569 --> 02:13:08.579 align:start position:0%
okay because this prioritized need was
 
02:13:11.689 --> 02:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
for both maintenance of services and
 
02:13:13.729 --> 02:13:13.739 align:start position:0%
projected additional needs and I can try
 
02:13:16.010 --> 02:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
to cut that a couple of ways so we could
 
02:13:19.729 --> 02:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
do what's maintenance minus projected
 
02:13:21.709 --> 02:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
what would the rate increase there be
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
versus if I took the full 15 million and
 
02:13:26.270 --> 02:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
applied that to rates what would the
 
02:13:28.850 --> 02:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
rate increase be there is that
 
02:13:28.860 --> 02:13:31.069 align:start position:0%
rate increase be there is that
correct

02:13:31.069 --> 02:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:13:34.189 --> 02:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
I'll let other comment I I lost you a
 
02:13:36.890 --> 02:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
little bit I I I have in my head sort of
 
02:13:39.410 --> 02:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
this graph that it's hard for me to
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
describe but basically you know if we if
 
02:13:46.010 --> 02:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
we don't increase the the rates I don't
 
02:13:47.629 --> 02:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
see how we're going to spend more money
 
02:13:49.790 --> 02:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
on more services
 
02:13:52.030 --> 02:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
if we increase the rates a little bit
 
02:13:55.069 --> 02:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to hopefully see an increase
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
in services
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
if we increase the rates too much
 
02:14:03.709 --> 02:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
we won't have any money to pay for the
 
02:14:06.410 --> 02:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
extra services that are now in demand
 
02:14:09.490 --> 02:14:09.500 align:start position:0%
so so there's sort of a Goldilocks
 
02:14:13.189 --> 02:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
balance here between money this 15
 
02:14:15.890 --> 02:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
million going to some rate hike versus
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
some incremental increase in demand
 
02:14:23.149 --> 02:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:25.010 --> 02:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
would you recommend Chris is something
 
02:14:28.069 --> 02:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
to say and then we'll come to you
 
02:14:30.589 --> 02:14:30.599 align:start position:0%
I know sorry Chris Antonello associate
 
02:14:33.169 --> 02:14:33.179 align:start position:0%
commissioner I just wanted to just two
 
02:14:34.850 --> 02:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
things because we actually are looking
 
02:14:34.860 --> 02:14:36.350 align:start position:0%
things because we actually are looking
at

02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:14:38.990 --> 02:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
um the CFI rates there is um Senate bill
 
02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:47.950 align:start position:0%
um the CFI rates there is um Senate bill
36.

02:14:47.950 --> 02:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:51.950 --> 02:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
must be something so Senate Bill 36
 
02:14:55.129 --> 02:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
um and actually Senate Bill 86 which is
 
02:14:56.810 --> 02:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
looking at rates but one of the things
 
02:14:59.810 --> 02:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
we actually were talking about today in
 
02:15:02.450 --> 02:15:02.460 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 36 is one of the things we
 
02:15:04.370 --> 02:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
need to do with the choices for
 
02:15:07.250 --> 02:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
Independence is really look at a true
 
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
rate study
 
02:15:11.089 --> 02:15:11.099 align:start position:0%
um and really understand what is the
 
02:15:13.790 --> 02:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
cost to provide the services and I think
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
because in and I think Melissa spoke
 
02:15:18.169 --> 02:15:18.179 align:start position:0%
about this a little bit
 
02:15:20.330 --> 02:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
um and Gina Bacchus has also talked is
 
02:15:24.890 --> 02:15:24.900 align:start position:0%
within the senior services you know we
 
02:15:26.930 --> 02:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
have different funding streams and they
 
02:15:28.910 --> 02:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
all have different rates based on the
 
02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
funding stream but at the end of the day
 
02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
it's the same Services that's being
 
02:15:35.629 --> 02:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
provided and so we really want to make
 
02:15:37.850 --> 02:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
sure we have parity across all of the
 
02:15:39.890 --> 02:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
different programs serving the same
 
02:15:43.490 --> 02:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
population and so
 
02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:45.290 align:start position:0%
population and so
what

02:15:45.290 --> 02:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:15:47.330 --> 02:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
what so one of the things we've been
 
02:15:48.890 --> 02:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
looking at is if we look at the three
 
02:15:50.569 --> 02:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
percent rate increase
 
02:15:52.370 --> 02:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
um in the governor's budget we also look
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
at a rate increase in Senate Bill 86 and
 
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
at the same time do the rate study so we
 
02:16:00.169 --> 02:16:00.179 align:start position:0%
can really understand what is the true
 
02:16:04.609 --> 02:16:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:06.350 --> 02:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
that's all good that's going to take
 
02:16:09.530 --> 02:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
time what I'm looking for is is the
 
02:16:12.290 --> 02:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
short term what can we do to make it
 
02:16:14.450 --> 02:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
better than it is without you know
 
02:16:16.669 --> 02:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
breaking something and and if we can
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
increase the rates a little bit in this
 
02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
part of Representative stringham's rates
 
02:16:28.490 --> 02:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
study uh and and then allocate this to
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
thinking we really will get more
 
02:16:34.129 --> 02:16:34.139 align:start position:0%
services I that that's that's where I'd
 
02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
be happy at the end of March everything
 
02:16:39.770 --> 02:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
you just said can't possibly happen by
 
02:16:41.690 --> 02:16:41.700 align:start position:0%
the end of March and that's all my focus
 
02:16:44.450 --> 02:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
is agree I think what I was saying is
 
02:16:46.030 --> 02:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
just really for the long term
 
02:16:48.589 --> 02:16:48.599 align:start position:0%
sustainability of the programs and I
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
think like Nathan said some of these
 
02:16:52.910 --> 02:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
dollars will go to maintain existing
 
02:16:54.650 --> 02:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
Services as well
 
02:16:54.660 --> 02:16:55.790 align:start position:0%
Services as well
okay

02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:57.410 align:start position:0%
okay
so

02:16:57.410 --> 02:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:17:00.650 --> 02:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
um Nathan how much did we lapse in this
 
02:17:00.660 --> 02:17:01.610 align:start position:0%
um Nathan how much did we lapse in this
area

02:17:01.610 --> 02:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:17:04.129 --> 02:17:04.139 align:start position:0%
or how much are we anticipated to lapse
 
02:17:07.429 --> 02:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
we actually aren't anticipated
 
02:17:11.209 --> 02:17:11.219 align:start position:0%
um we actually carried four dollars from
 
02:17:15.290 --> 02:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
last year in to cover services for this
 
02:17:19.129 --> 02:17:19.139 align:start position:0%
year and then anything that we do not
 
02:17:21.230 --> 02:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
spend actually gets distributed to
 
02:17:23.629 --> 02:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
providers so how much did we distribute
 
02:17:25.490 --> 02:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
we haven't distributed any because we
 
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
needed money from last year to cover the
 
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
services in this year so at the end of
 
02:17:33.290 --> 02:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
the biennium we would look to see what
 
02:17:35.330 --> 02:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
is left and it goes to Providers but I
 
02:17:37.310 --> 02:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
believe it's projected like under two
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
million dollars it's not I and and this
 
02:17:43.610 --> 02:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
is related to account 2152 and the class
 
02:17:46.730 --> 02:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
note for the 504 where we're supposed to
 
02:17:48.410 --> 02:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
make that payout and we've been working
 
02:17:51.709 --> 02:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
with CMS because it technically doesn't
 
02:17:54.290 --> 02:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
follow standard Medicaid protocol and
 
02:17:55.790 --> 02:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure out whether we
 
02:17:58.370 --> 02:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
can actually do that or not so just
 
02:17:59.750 --> 02:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
um that's still something that that
 
02:18:05.150 --> 02:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:07.450 align:start position:0%
 
how

02:18:07.450 --> 02:18:07.460 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're going to be able to
 
02:18:11.570 --> 02:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
make that payment
 
02:18:14.270 --> 02:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
I wish I knew it is often difficult
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
getting a decent and rapid response from
 
02:18:18.469 --> 02:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
the federal government it took us two
 
02:18:20.030 --> 02:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
and a half months to get one simple
 
02:18:22.730 --> 02:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
thing resolved most recently so I'm
 
02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
hoping soon we'll continue to pressure
 
02:18:27.049 --> 02:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
them to get an answer
 
02:18:28.910 --> 02:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
because what would this Pro those
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
providers will be expecting this at the
 
02:18:32.330 --> 02:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
end of the biennium
 
02:18:35.690 --> 02:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
probably planning on it in order to
 
02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:37.669 align:start position:0%
probably planning on it in order to
stay

02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
stay
 
02:18:37.679 --> 02:18:41.089 align:start position:0%
stay
viable

02:18:41.089 --> 02:18:41.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:41.099 --> 02:18:42.009 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:18:42.009 --> 02:18:42.019 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:18:44.450 --> 02:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
so this last part of this conversation
 
02:18:46.969 --> 02:18:46.979 align:start position:0%
is is a little disturbing to me because
 
02:18:51.469 --> 02:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
I I think I recall very clearly that we
 
02:18:56.110 --> 02:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
had this conversation last budget where
 
02:18:59.030 --> 02:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
this issue of if we can't spend the
 
02:19:01.549 --> 02:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
money let's give it to the providers and
 
02:19:04.490 --> 02:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
we had a discussion where I think we all
 
02:19:08.509 --> 02:19:08.519 align:start position:0%
aligned and agreed that rather than try
 
02:19:11.570 --> 02:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
to have money at the end that we could
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
give to Providers we wanted to improve
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
the rates so that we could provide the
 
02:19:20.330 --> 02:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
services and the and and the debate at
 
02:19:23.209 --> 02:19:23.219 align:start position:0%
the time was wouldn't we rather increase
 
02:19:25.490 --> 02:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
the rates so that we're paying the
 
02:19:27.490 --> 02:19:27.500 align:start position:0%
providers for additional Services
 
02:19:29.929 --> 02:19:29.939 align:start position:0%
instead of having them not do the
 
02:19:32.089 --> 02:19:32.099 align:start position:0%
services and then paying them to do
 
02:19:32.099 --> 02:19:32.990 align:start position:0%
services and then paying them to do
nothing

02:19:32.990 --> 02:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
and and so I I believe I believe we said
 
02:19:39.950 --> 02:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
that we should increase rates and not
 
02:19:42.530 --> 02:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
have money available to just pay them at
 
02:19:43.549 --> 02:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
the end
 
02:19:46.730 --> 02:19:46.740 align:start position:0%
am I am I misremembering this Mr Ripple
 
02:19:49.310 --> 02:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
do you how's your memory
 
02:19:50.990 --> 02:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
I do remember that but I think there was
 
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
a provision added in the Senate that
 
02:19:55.130 --> 02:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
directed announcement funds to be paid
 
02:19:56.330 --> 02:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
to the providers at the end of the
 
02:19:58.670 --> 02:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
biennium similar to what's
 
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
similar to what's done with nursing
 
02:20:09.590 --> 02:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:12.050 --> 02:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'd like to continue to think
 
02:20:13.969 --> 02:20:13.979 align:start position:0%
that the house position on this is that
 
02:20:15.710 --> 02:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
we would rather have the money go to
 
02:20:18.290 --> 02:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
higher rates so that the services are
 
02:20:21.650 --> 02:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
are provided rather than turn out to be
 
02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
bonus checks for not providing service
 
02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
at the end of the biennium
 
02:20:28.310 --> 02:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
do you is there any argument
 
02:20:29.570 --> 02:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:20:30.830 --> 02:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
well I don't think they're going to be
 
02:20:33.889 --> 02:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
bonus checks I really don't think
 
02:20:35.330 --> 02:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
they're going to be bonus checks I think
 
02:20:36.590 --> 02:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to be
 
02:20:38.030 --> 02:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
checks that are going to be really
 
02:20:38.040 --> 02:20:39.230 align:start position:0%
checks that are going to be really
needed

02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:20:40.969 --> 02:20:40.979 align:start position:0%
um for checks for not delivering a
 
02:20:40.979 --> 02:20:42.170 align:start position:0%
um for checks for not delivering a
service

02:20:42.170 --> 02:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:20:44.210 --> 02:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
but their rates have been way too low
 
02:20:47.210 --> 02:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
and so in order to keep these agencies
 
02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
viable and being able to have enough
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
employees to deliver the services I
 
02:20:53.870 --> 02:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
think we've either better get the rates
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
up or you got to give them
 
02:20:58.550 --> 02:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
what's left over at the end I mean which
 
02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like it makes a lot of
 
02:21:03.530 --> 02:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
sense but we need to get these rates up
 
02:21:06.170 --> 02:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
I think we're in agreement then it would
 
02:21:09.050 --> 02:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
be better to get the rates up so that we
 
02:21:11.210 --> 02:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
can deliver more services than to wait
 
02:21:13.490 --> 02:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
to the end of the two years to give
 
02:21:16.849 --> 02:21:16.859 align:start position:0%
checks to just keep the places alive
 
02:21:18.650 --> 02:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we may I mean it sounds
 
02:21:20.389 --> 02:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
like we're still waiting to see whether
 
02:21:24.530 --> 02:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay so what did we decide to do with
 
02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:30.469 align:start position:0%
okay so what did we decide to do with
234

02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
234
 
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to get some more information
 
02:21:35.450 --> 02:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
from you a recommendation on what we can
 
02:21:37.730 --> 02:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
get away with in terms of improving
 
02:21:40.309 --> 02:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
rates here see if it makes sense in the
 
02:21:42.170 --> 02:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
context of what representative Stringham
 
02:21:44.330 --> 02:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
is doing so we have like one approach
 
02:21:48.349 --> 02:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
for our targeted rate increases and then
 
02:21:50.330 --> 02:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
we'll see what happens to that 15
 
02:21:53.929 --> 02:21:53.939 align:start position:0%
million meanwhile we still have 18.5 to
 
02:21:55.969 --> 02:21:55.979 align:start position:0%
look for the county cap
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's my summary
 
02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:01.030 align:start position:0%
that's my summary
okay

02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:22:04.670 --> 02:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh 235
 
02:22:07.849 --> 02:22:07.859 align:start position:0%
section 235 appropriates 20.5 million in
 
02:22:10.730 --> 02:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 for maintenance of the mmis
 
02:22:10.740 --> 02:22:15.710 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 for maintenance of the mmis
system

02:22:15.710 --> 02:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:15.720 --> 02:22:21.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:22:21.250 --> 02:22:21.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:24.650 --> 02:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
ERS and you gotten aligned or do you
 
02:22:26.570 --> 02:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
want to wait for him on this I I haven't
 
02:22:28.490 --> 02:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
spoken with him I can certainly give a
 
02:22:30.050 --> 02:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
little bit of background I I wasn't here
 
02:22:31.250 --> 02:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
for it so that I don't know all the
 
02:22:33.710 --> 02:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
details but during the prior
 
02:22:36.170 --> 02:22:36.180 align:start position:0%
um budget session we had included the
 
02:22:39.650 --> 02:22:39.660 align:start position:0%
mmis maintenance costs in in our in our
 
02:22:43.250 --> 02:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
hb1 agency request during the
 
02:22:44.929 --> 02:22:44.939 align:start position:0%
legislative process that was pulled out
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
and put into an hb2 provision there is
 
02:22:51.170 --> 02:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
an ongoing uh Capital uh appropriation
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
for the overhaul of the mmis system for
 
02:22:55.849 --> 02:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
the modularization so to speak of the
 
02:22:59.710 --> 02:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
mmis system but but the costs here come
 
02:23:02.210 --> 02:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
primarily directly from our from our
 
02:23:04.849 --> 02:23:04.859 align:start position:0%
contract with conduit for the ongoing
 
02:23:06.770 --> 02:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the Medicaid system which
 
02:23:09.950 --> 02:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
all Medicaid providers in this state are
 
02:23:12.050 --> 02:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
registered and and through which we
 
02:23:14.570 --> 02:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
process all those claims so this is a
 
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is a critical key function and and
 
02:23:19.429 --> 02:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
the the amounts here as as I am
 
02:23:21.530 --> 02:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
understand it and I'm waiting for some
 
02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
additional detail from Dave weeder's are
 
02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
primarily driven by the specific costs
 
02:23:29.090 --> 02:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
that we that were contracted for
 
02:23:32.630 --> 02:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
02:23:34.969 --> 02:23:34.979 align:start position:0%
so starting in on this I
 
02:23:38.469 --> 02:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
I I'm perfectly okay with having the Mis
 
02:23:42.110 --> 02:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
mmis supported but but I think what we
 
02:23:46.969 --> 02:23:46.979 align:start position:0%
tried to do last term was to take the
 
02:23:49.969 --> 02:23:49.979 align:start position:0%
one-time expenses related to the upgrade
 
02:23:54.530 --> 02:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
of mmis and put it into hb2
 
02:23:57.530 --> 02:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
and then have the ordinary operations of
 
02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
the mmis continue to be in hb1
 
02:24:03.770 --> 02:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
so that we would have like an
 
02:24:07.490 --> 02:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
operational ongoing year over year over
 
02:24:10.190 --> 02:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
year over year Baseline of comparison of
 
02:24:13.130 --> 02:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
what it takes to run the system
 
02:24:16.250 --> 02:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
but because there was a major upgrade of
 
02:24:19.309 --> 02:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
20 million dollars or whatever it was
 
02:24:21.650 --> 02:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
thinking that was a one-time investment
 
02:24:24.530 --> 02:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
we put it into hb2 as sort of a
 
02:24:26.570 --> 02:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
standalone that's what I think we tried
 
02:24:27.650 --> 02:24:27.660 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
so now that I see another 20 million in
 
02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:33.530 align:start position:0%
so now that I see another 20 million in
hb2

02:24:33.530 --> 02:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
it makes me wonder
 
02:24:38.450 --> 02:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
what happened to the 20 million that we
 
02:24:41.809 --> 02:24:41.819 align:start position:0%
put in the hb2 last time
 
02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
does this make it 40 million dollars to
 
02:24:47.570 --> 02:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
do upgrades or and and if this is really
 
02:24:49.969 --> 02:24:49.979 align:start position:0%
meant like I heard you say that this is
 
02:24:53.450 --> 02:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
meant to be operations leasing of the
 
02:24:53.460 --> 02:24:54.530 align:start position:0%
meant to be operations leasing of the
system

02:24:54.530 --> 02:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:24:56.389 --> 02:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
this should be
 
02:25:01.010 --> 02:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
in hb1 not hb2 because it's ongoing
 
02:25:04.130 --> 02:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
operations correct so if you if you turn
 
02:25:06.889 --> 02:25:06.899 align:start position:0%
to page 924 that's our Medicaid
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
management information system accounting
 
02:25:11.450 --> 02:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
unit and that's where historically we
 
02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
have budgeted
 
02:25:15.170 --> 02:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
um our our maintenance costs for the
 
02:25:16.730 --> 02:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
Medicaid management information system
 
02:25:20.809 --> 02:25:20.819 align:start position:0%
which is uh it's it's it uh this is a
 
02:25:22.490 --> 02:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
very poor choice of words but it's a
 
02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
massive complex system and so
 
02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
historically you'll see like the actual
 
02:25:28.730 --> 02:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
spend there the thirty five thousand
 
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
dollars primarily coming out of the
 
02:25:32.270 --> 02:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
contract line and then a little ought to
 
02:25:34.550 --> 02:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
set aside and current expenses
 
02:25:36.349 --> 02:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
um that is where it is typically paid
 
02:25:39.950 --> 02:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
from did you mean 35 million
 
02:25:42.170 --> 02:25:42.180 align:start position:0%
you said thirty five thousand oh I
 
02:25:44.870 --> 02:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
apologize 35 I'm sorry I've worked until
 
02:25:46.910 --> 02:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
10 last night it's Friday no no it's all
 
02:25:48.530 --> 02:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
right it's all right I I just want to
 
02:25:49.790 --> 02:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm looking at the right
 
02:25:52.670 --> 02:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
number yes yep it's 35 million dollars
 
02:25:55.730 --> 02:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
it was actual expense in 22 and so
 
02:25:58.190 --> 02:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
in the prior um
 
02:26:00.710 --> 02:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
so it would definitely be my preference
 
02:26:03.230 --> 02:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
to have this as part of the operating
 
02:26:05.750 --> 02:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
budget going forward
 
02:26:07.730 --> 02:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
um and the amounts that we put forward
 
02:26:10.730 --> 02:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
this year are actually slightly fewer
 
02:26:15.910 --> 02:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
General funds in 2223 it was 12.4 13.1
 
02:26:18.650 --> 02:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars of General funds in 22
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
and 23 so we're slightly less than that
 
02:26:26.030 --> 02:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:29.630 --> 02:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
okay so just to make sure I'm tracking
 
02:26:31.730 --> 02:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
with what we're agreeing on
 
02:26:34.610 --> 02:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
you you I think you're agreeing that
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
this hp2 item 235 this 20.5 million
 
02:26:42.290 --> 02:26:42.300 align:start position:0%
there's some portion of this that really
 
02:26:45.110 --> 02:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
is meant to be operations
 
02:26:47.870 --> 02:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
and that that should be moved out of hb2
 
02:26:50.809 --> 02:26:50.819 align:start position:0%
and into hb1
 
02:26:53.510 --> 02:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
is that is that accurate that is
 
02:26:56.750 --> 02:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
accurate one challenge that I think is
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
before us is that this appropriation is
 
02:27:01.969 --> 02:27:01.979 align:start position:0%
made with the state 20 State fiscal year
 
02:27:08.510 --> 02:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:11.870 --> 02:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
so when you said that this 20 million is
 
02:27:13.790 --> 02:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
the maintenance contract what's the 35
 
02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:15.429 align:start position:0%
the maintenance contract what's the 35
million

02:27:15.429 --> 02:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:27:18.349 --> 02:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
so there's the 20 million but there's
 
02:27:20.330 --> 02:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
also the language to accept and expand
 
02:27:23.210 --> 02:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
the federal funds associated with that
 
02:27:23.220 --> 02:27:24.349 align:start position:0%
the federal funds associated with that
so

02:27:24.349 --> 02:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:24.359 --> 02:27:24.889 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:27:24.889 --> 02:27:24.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:27.410 --> 02:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
it's approximately
 
02:27:30.290 --> 02:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's almost uh it's
 
02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
almost a 25 general fund a 75 Federal
 
02:27:37.070 --> 02:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
fund spend that that we're able to get
 
02:27:41.450 --> 02:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:44.030 --> 02:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
okay let me ask my question wrong so I
 
02:27:45.710 --> 02:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
understand that you're trying to get
 
02:27:47.570 --> 02:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
surplus funds from this year to use for
 
02:27:48.710 --> 02:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
next year
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
if that was not a game that needed to be
 
02:27:51.830 --> 02:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
played would this just be a 55 million
 
02:27:56.270 --> 02:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:57.710 --> 02:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
I mean is that the only reason it's in
 
02:28:01.670 --> 02:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
hb2 because it's surplus funds
 
02:28:04.130 --> 02:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
the reason that it's in hp2 is because
 
02:28:06.830 --> 02:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
it was in hb2 last time and in order to
 
02:28:08.570 --> 02:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
hit the three percent we were unable to
 
02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
get incorporated into our operating
 
02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
budget okay so then last time was it the
 
02:28:15.349 --> 02:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
same game there was 35 million in hb1
 
02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
and then 20 million in hp2
 
02:28:19.250 --> 02:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
I mean roughly I don't need exact
 
02:28:20.389 --> 02:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
numbers but I'm just trying to
 
02:28:21.349 --> 02:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
understand the concept that we're
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
playing here yep so so last time uh in
 
02:28:28.070 --> 02:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 22 there was uh 45.5
 
02:28:31.910 --> 02:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars in 22.48 million dollars
 
02:28:34.309 --> 02:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
in 23.
 
02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
total funds General and federal so is
 
02:28:38.030 --> 02:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
that yes
 
02:28:41.150 --> 02:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
yes sort of sorry I'm being verbose yes
 
02:28:44.270 --> 02:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
correct okay so so would that imply that
 
02:28:46.849 --> 02:28:46.859 align:start position:0%
it was put into hp2 this time
 
02:28:48.889 --> 02:28:48.899 align:start position:0%
primarily because to capture the funds
 
02:28:50.030 --> 02:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
from the Surplus
 
02:28:56.270 --> 02:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:56.280 --> 02:28:58.670 align:start position:0%
 
I

02:28:58.670 --> 02:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:01.790 --> 02:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
so so here here's kind of one of my
 
02:29:04.250 --> 02:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
dilemmas but I guess the Dilemma is
 
02:29:06.170 --> 02:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
mitigated by the fact that we're
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
essentially reserving 23 Surplus to
 
02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
spend in the next budget
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
it would it would it would it would help
 
02:29:17.510 --> 02:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
me to know
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
if it were true especially
 
02:29:24.230 --> 02:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
that that Surplus is because we
 
02:29:28.309 --> 02:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
underspent what we intended to spend in
 
02:29:30.770 --> 02:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
the one-time implementation of the mmis
 
02:29:34.610 --> 02:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
upgrade if if we had an mmis upgrade
 
02:29:36.469 --> 02:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
plan and we had money budgeted against
 
02:29:38.750 --> 02:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
it and for whatever reason we weren't
 
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
able to spend it in a timely basis
 
02:29:44.090 --> 02:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
having that money roll forward into the
 
02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
next fiscal year I got no issue with
 
02:29:47.750 --> 02:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
that makes sense
 
02:29:52.429 --> 02:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
he gas this is a lot of money so so how
 
02:29:58.910 --> 02:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
do we how do I I don't yet feel
 
02:30:01.490 --> 02:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
comfortable knowing how much money we
 
02:30:03.650 --> 02:30:03.660 align:start position:0%
spent on upgrades last the current
 
02:30:06.290 --> 02:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
budget and how much we expect to spend
 
02:30:09.230 --> 02:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
on upgrades in the next budget and what
 
02:30:11.690 --> 02:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
the operations
 
02:30:14.090 --> 02:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
Investments have been over the two
 
02:30:16.910 --> 02:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
budgets I'm I don't have a clear picture
 
02:30:19.550 --> 02:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
so I I think this I I could have Dave
 
02:30:21.710 --> 02:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
Weavers come down on Monday for our
 
02:30:23.210 --> 02:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
working session maybe we can talk some
 
02:30:24.650 --> 02:30:24.660 align:start position:0%
of this through because I think we have
 
02:30:26.210 --> 02:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
to remember we have a large Capital
 
02:30:28.730 --> 02:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
appropriation over here for the long
 
02:30:30.550 --> 02:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
term you know kind of the five six year
 
02:30:33.889 --> 02:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
modularization of the mmis system and
 
02:30:35.270 --> 02:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
then over here we have the ongoing
 
02:30:37.490 --> 02:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs so every time we do a
 
02:30:39.410 --> 02:30:39.420 align:start position:0%
waiver anytime we have a rate adjustment
 
02:30:41.389 --> 02:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
every time there's eligibility changes
 
02:30:44.030 --> 02:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
or any federal law regulations change we
 
02:30:46.190 --> 02:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
have to have our contractor constantly
 
02:30:48.170 --> 02:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
upgrade those systems right and those
 
02:30:52.370 --> 02:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
are good hb1 numbers yep yeah and and I
 
02:30:54.530 --> 02:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
and Investments and upgrades that are
 
02:30:57.590 --> 02:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
meant to be one time I I can see as an
 
02:30:59.630 --> 02:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
hb2 item go ahead representative right I
 
02:31:00.889 --> 02:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
mean I think the distance you're trying
 
02:31:02.690 --> 02:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
to draw which hopefully David can an
 
02:31:04.370 --> 02:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
answer is there's the maintenance
 
02:31:06.110 --> 02:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
contracts on things which have nothing
 
02:31:08.090 --> 02:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
to do with upgrades and then they also
 
02:31:10.370 --> 02:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
had the big upgrade thing which is what
 
02:31:12.110 --> 02:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
he's referring to here but nice to know
 
02:31:13.670 --> 02:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
what the separation is between those two
 
02:31:15.710 --> 02:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
in all these numbers both going backward
 
02:31:18.349 --> 02:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
and going forward of course so so the
 
02:31:20.690 --> 02:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
dilemma here is that in the ways and
 
02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
means estimate I think we have like 111
 
02:31:25.790 --> 02:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars short of the governor's
 
02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:27.590 align:start position:0%
million dollars short of the governor's
budget

02:31:27.590 --> 02:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
02:31:31.730 --> 02:31:31.740 align:start position:0%
um so when we get around division one
 
02:31:33.290 --> 02:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
two and three
 
02:31:36.469 --> 02:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
and people start looking at big numbers
 
02:31:38.690 --> 02:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
you know if we're going to have the big
 
02:31:40.910 --> 02:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
number I have to be able to explain it
 
02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
and right now I I am not able to explain
 
02:31:45.410 --> 02:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
it it's too big a number for me not to
 
02:31:45.420 --> 02:31:46.370 align:start position:0%
it it's too big a number for me not to
understand

02:31:46.370 --> 02:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:31:49.070 --> 02:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not opposed to it I just first I
 
02:31:50.750 --> 02:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
want to understand it and then I want to
 
02:31:53.330 --> 02:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
have it allocated between HP one and two
 
02:31:53.340 --> 02:31:55.429 align:start position:0%
have it allocated between HP one and two
and

02:31:55.429 --> 02:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:59.210 --> 02:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
in a good principled away
 
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
all right so if you can help me with
 
02:32:02.210 --> 02:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
that I'd appreciate it are there
 
02:32:05.170 --> 02:32:05.180 align:start position:0%
questions comments
 
02:32:07.849 --> 02:32:07.859 align:start position:0%
okay this do you think representative
 
02:32:09.230 --> 02:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
Holt's going to have questions on this
 
02:32:10.730 --> 02:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
is that we should now let's go forward
 
02:32:10.740 --> 02:32:11.929 align:start position:0%
is that we should now let's go forward
then

02:32:11.929 --> 02:32:11.939 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:32:14.270 --> 02:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
okay so we haven't done anything with
 
02:32:20.330 --> 02:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:22.490 --> 02:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh 237.
 
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
237 appropriates funds for elevated
 
02:32:26.929 --> 02:32:26.939 align:start position:0%
enrollment unwinding related to the end
 
02:32:30.110 --> 02:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:31.490 --> 02:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
so I have a question about this I
 
02:32:33.349 --> 02:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
understand what this is but shouldn't
 
02:32:35.210 --> 02:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
there be a corresponding reduction
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
accounted for somewhere in other words
 
02:32:39.770 --> 02:32:39.780 align:start position:0%
we're starting to disenroll people but
 
02:32:42.110 --> 02:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about having more money to
 
02:32:43.309 --> 02:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
get them disenrolled and I understand
 
02:32:45.410 --> 02:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
part of that is the fbap is dropping
 
02:32:47.690 --> 02:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
down and people are appealing and maybe
 
02:32:50.270 --> 02:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
not necessarily dropping off but some
 
02:32:52.730 --> 02:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
people should be dropping off
 
02:32:52.740 --> 02:32:55.550 align:start position:0%
people should be dropping off
right

02:32:55.550 --> 02:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:58.849 --> 02:32:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:01.550 --> 02:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
people will be dropping off
 
02:33:05.090 --> 02:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
um but we're only able to disenroll a
 
02:33:07.309 --> 02:33:07.319 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of them each month so
 
02:33:08.990 --> 02:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
we're not able to go ahead and try to
 
02:33:10.670 --> 02:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
disenroll the hundred thousand or ninety
 
02:33:13.670 --> 02:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
thousand people you know day one because
 
02:33:16.190 --> 02:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
we we have to remember that as as those
 
02:33:18.290 --> 02:33:18.300 align:start position:0%
people re-enroll because some of them
 
02:33:21.290 --> 02:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
may be eligible we don't want to have an
 
02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
annual cycle of where 50 000 people you
 
02:33:26.510 --> 02:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
know I'll I'll go to re-enroll on the
 
02:33:28.969 --> 02:33:28.979 align:start position:0%
same day every year and so that's that's
 
02:33:30.770 --> 02:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
part of the process
 
02:33:34.849 --> 02:33:34.859 align:start position:0%
um but but your your thinking Medicaid
 
02:33:36.830 --> 02:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
budget big picture
 
02:33:40.550 --> 02:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
if if if we are seeing these individuals
 
02:33:43.490 --> 02:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
come off the rolls why aren't we seeing
 
02:33:46.070 --> 02:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
a larger decrease in spending
 
02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
um I think Henry lippman when he's been
 
02:33:50.809 --> 02:33:50.819 align:start position:0%
down here he's pointed out that one of
 
02:33:53.389 --> 02:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
the biggest areas of um enrollment
 
02:33:56.510 --> 02:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
growth has been in the expanded medicaid
 
02:33:59.870 --> 02:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
area and and that's a 90-10 match and
 
02:34:01.370 --> 02:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
and again you're not you're not
 
02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily seeing that in the in the
 
02:34:06.290 --> 02:34:06.300 align:start position:0%
accounts um within our budget today and
 
02:34:07.910 --> 02:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
because that's a 90-10 match a smaller
 
02:34:10.370 --> 02:34:10.380 align:start position:0%
dollar amount is needed for that but but
 
02:34:13.250 --> 02:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
because it's a 90-10 match 90 being the
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
federal government 10 being the general
 
02:34:17.690 --> 02:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
um we're not going to see though those
 
02:34:20.690 --> 02:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
those kind of expected decreases in
 
02:34:24.889 --> 02:34:24.899 align:start position:0%
spend but nor do you have the costs
 
02:34:28.190 --> 02:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
I mean they're picking up 90 90 of it
 
02:34:30.290 --> 02:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
yes you know basically I think what
 
02:34:31.790 --> 02:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
you're the six team and it's a pretty
 
02:34:33.650 --> 02:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
darn precise number here
 
02:34:35.330 --> 02:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see the equation that I'm
 
02:34:36.889 --> 02:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
sure you must have been or somebody did
 
02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
the whole fmap thing over the next nine
 
02:34:40.490 --> 02:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
months or whatever it is yeah I can
 
02:34:42.110 --> 02:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely share that spreadsheet okay
 
02:34:44.990 --> 02:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:47.150 --> 02:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
represent an order
 
02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:48.050 align:start position:0%
represent an order
um

02:34:48.050 --> 02:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:49.610 --> 02:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
did weird
 
02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
the question and 234 and 235 I think we
 
02:34:56.570 --> 02:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
brought up the issue of whether or not
 
02:34:59.510 --> 02:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
they should be in house bill one so did
 
02:35:01.969 --> 02:35:01.979 align:start position:0%
we decide no we weren't doing that or
 
02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
did we finish that discussion or I I
 
02:35:08.210 --> 02:35:08.220 align:start position:0%
think I summarized it but just to make
 
02:35:10.849 --> 02:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
sure I communicated it right Mr White
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
what do you what do you think we agreed
 
02:35:14.870 --> 02:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
to on 235
 
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
what would I like you to agree to or
 
02:35:18.530 --> 02:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
what do I think we don't know what we
 
02:35:19.969 --> 02:35:19.979 align:start position:0%
actually did
 
02:35:22.429 --> 02:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
I I think we agreed that I needed to
 
02:35:23.990 --> 02:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
bring Dave down here to give you more
 
02:35:25.550 --> 02:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
information so that you have the
 
02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
decision available to you my preference
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
would be operating budget so we we can
 
02:35:31.969 --> 02:35:31.979 align:start position:0%
get it back in the operating budget
 
02:35:34.190 --> 02:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
because we do expect it to continue to
 
02:35:37.849 --> 02:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
be an ongoing cost into future biennia
 
02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that there is
 
02:35:43.010 --> 02:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
legitimate one-time Capital kind of
 
02:35:46.190 --> 02:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
thing so that's okay to live in hb2
 
02:35:48.170 --> 02:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
we I just need to know where it's going
 
02:35:50.570 --> 02:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
to go I I would agree yep but I would
 
02:35:52.429 --> 02:35:52.439 align:start position:0%
like to clarify one thing I want to make
 
02:35:55.370 --> 02:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
sure representative norgren's okay
 
02:35:57.770 --> 02:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh representative Waller
 
02:36:00.770 --> 02:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
so I'm going back to the unwind of the
 
02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid sure
 
02:36:08.710 --> 02:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
um that's all in 23 also that's all um
 
02:36:10.969 --> 02:36:10.979 align:start position:0%
this year's
 
02:36:14.030 --> 02:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
Surplus so how does that how is that
 
02:36:15.889 --> 02:36:15.899 align:start position:0%
going to work are you going to
 
02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
put that in I mean you're going to use
 
02:36:21.710 --> 02:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
it over the next year right yes yep
 
02:36:23.150 --> 02:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
that's correct it's coming out of the
 
02:36:26.450 --> 02:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
state fiscal 23-year Surplus for what we
 
02:36:28.670 --> 02:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
you know what will be a one-time expense
 
02:36:30.530 --> 02:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
again the Medicaid unwind and continuous
 
02:36:32.630 --> 02:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
enrollment is a bit of a historical
 
02:36:32.640 --> 02:36:34.309 align:start position:0%
enrollment is a bit of a historical
anachronism

02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
anachronism
 
02:36:36.770 --> 02:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
um so so we would roll that into our
 
02:36:39.050 --> 02:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
standard Medicaid account and Chip
 
02:36:41.270 --> 02:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
account and and use it to pay for those
 
02:36:52.429 --> 02:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:56.530 --> 02:36:56.540 align:start position:0%
so I think I'm okay with it here
 
02:36:59.389 --> 02:36:59.399 align:start position:0%
right you guys have a problem with this
 
02:37:04.490 --> 02:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:04.500 --> 02:37:06.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:37:06.110 --> 02:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:37:09.170 --> 02:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
well you'll let us know I'm sure okay so
 
02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:11.570 align:start position:0%
well you'll let us know I'm sure okay so
239

02:37:11.570 --> 02:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
239
 
02:37:14.750 --> 02:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead Mr Ripple
 
02:37:18.170 --> 02:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
239 appropriates 838 000 for the purpose
 
02:37:19.849 --> 02:37:19.859 align:start position:0%
of funding an audit of the integrated
 
02:37:34.550 --> 02:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:38.349 --> 02:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
I wondered why it wasn't in hb1
 
02:37:40.969 --> 02:37:40.979 align:start position:0%
this was originally included as one of
 
02:37:44.950 --> 02:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:48.110 --> 02:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
capturing fy23 and they're rolling 23
 
02:37:50.630 --> 02:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
money forward yeah
 
02:37:52.670 --> 02:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
is it and I think this is the only way
 
02:37:55.610 --> 02:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
to roll 23 money forward as an hp2 isn't
 
02:37:57.950 --> 02:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
it this is the only vehicle for that yes
 
02:37:57.960 --> 02:37:59.870 align:start position:0%
it this is the only vehicle for that yes
yeah

02:37:59.870 --> 02:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:38:01.969 --> 02:38:01.979 align:start position:0%
go ahead can I set a really basic newbie
 
02:38:05.690 --> 02:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
question so if we're taking 23 funds
 
02:38:08.510 --> 02:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
from the Surplus to pay for these items
 
02:38:12.650 --> 02:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
this has nothing to do with
 
02:38:15.290 --> 02:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
the revenue estimates or the governor's
 
02:38:17.389 --> 02:38:17.399 align:start position:0%
budgets in terms of cutting however we
 
02:38:20.450 --> 02:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
could take this Surplus okay the first
 
02:38:21.889 --> 02:38:21.899 align:start position:0%
part of the statement was true has
 
02:38:23.330 --> 02:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
nothing with Revenue estimates second
 
02:38:24.830 --> 02:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
part is it definitely relates to the
 
02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
02:38:29.330 --> 02:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
because we could have taken These funds
 
02:38:32.690 --> 02:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
and applied them elsewhere gotcha I
 
02:38:44.170 --> 02:38:44.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:46.849 --> 02:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
I don't think what I learned what I I
 
02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
thought I understood from that q a
 
02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
you know I I
 
02:38:57.410 --> 02:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
I I think I think when we take fy23
 
02:38:57.420 --> 02:38:58.309 align:start position:0%
I I think I think when we take fy23
money

02:38:58.309 --> 02:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
and roll it into a need
 
02:39:03.230 --> 02:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
or something that's going to be in the
 
02:39:04.429 --> 02:39:04.439 align:start position:0%
current budget
 
02:39:08.030 --> 02:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
we do it kind of outside the governor's
 
02:39:10.969 --> 02:39:10.979 align:start position:0%
budget it's it's outside of that budget
 
02:39:13.130 --> 02:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
it um
 
02:39:16.309 --> 02:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
and I don't I don't see it affecting the
 
02:39:18.889 --> 02:39:18.899 align:start position:0%
governor's budget because it's a way to
 
02:39:22.010 --> 02:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
not do an end run but it's just a way to
 
02:39:24.950 --> 02:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
have you know a parallel spend that
 
02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't show up in the in the governor's
 
02:39:30.830 --> 02:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
budget it it it it it
 
02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:31.550 align:start position:0%
budget it it it it it
um

02:39:31.550 --> 02:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:33.530 --> 02:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
this is something that Senator Moore
 
02:39:35.870 --> 02:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
seemed to be really good at right so I
 
02:39:38.270 --> 02:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
guess if you're we're sort of splitting
 
02:39:39.650 --> 02:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
hairs at this point you could say it's
 
02:39:41.090 --> 02:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
not on the budget it's kind of like the
 
02:39:42.710 --> 02:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion thing it's not on the
 
02:39:44.750 --> 02:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
budget either but okay
 
02:39:46.250 --> 02:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
you just grab either way you want to but
 
02:39:48.469 --> 02:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
well I'm just trying to understand it if
 
02:39:50.750 --> 02:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
I were new to this and I feel like I'm
 
02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
new every day how I would try to
 
02:39:54.710 --> 02:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
understand it and I would try to
 
02:39:57.410 --> 02:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
understand it that that if we did not do
 
02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
this rollover of 23 money into a future
 
02:40:03.469 --> 02:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
expense it would instead end up going up
 
02:40:06.170 --> 02:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
into the rainy day fund and then if we
 
02:40:07.670 --> 02:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
had a problem
 
02:40:10.130 --> 02:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
we'd have money up in the rainy day fund
 
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
but bringing money out of the rainy day
 
02:40:15.530 --> 02:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
fund just for operational kinds of
 
02:40:18.170 --> 02:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
things is more problematic because there
 
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
are a lot of rules that we are supposed
 
02:40:23.270 --> 02:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
to follow when we spend rainy day money
 
02:40:26.809 --> 02:40:26.819 align:start position:0%
on things well that's true okay but we
 
02:40:29.090 --> 02:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
could also do it for some we use it for
 
02:40:30.530 --> 02:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
some other purpose we could play the
 
02:40:31.790 --> 02:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
same game the governor's playing okay
 
02:40:33.889 --> 02:40:33.899 align:start position:0%
we're going to kill it here but we're
 
02:40:36.349 --> 02:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
going to put it somewhere else in still
 
02:40:38.030 --> 02:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
pull that out of surplus and dump it
 
02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:39.290 align:start position:0%
pull that out of surplus and dump it
into

02:40:39.290 --> 02:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:40:42.830 --> 02:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
like the county cap for instance
 
02:40:46.250 --> 02:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
right so so one way to find the 18 and a
 
02:40:48.530 --> 02:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
half million is if there's some other
 
02:40:51.710 --> 02:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
Surplus in FY 23 that we want to pull
 
02:40:55.130 --> 02:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
forward into helping us with that 18 and
 
02:40:56.750 --> 02:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
a half million correct but essentially
 
02:40:59.450 --> 02:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
you're reallocating part of the
 
02:41:00.889 --> 02:41:00.899 align:start position:0%
don't call the governor's budget but
 
02:41:02.570 --> 02:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
call the governor's use of the surplus
 
02:41:05.030 --> 02:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
funds from 2023.
 
02:41:07.610 --> 02:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
all right I I won't call it that because
 
02:41:12.910 --> 02:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:15.889 --> 02:41:15.899 align:start position:0%
one last clarification in my brain so
 
02:41:18.349 --> 02:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
when we talk about
 
02:41:18.359 --> 02:41:20.750 align:start position:0%
when we talk about
finding

02:41:20.750 --> 02:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
finding
 
02:41:23.809 --> 02:41:23.819 align:start position:0%
money to cut to to meet the revenue
 
02:41:27.710 --> 02:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
estimates is this 2023 money something
 
02:41:31.010 --> 02:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
if we cut let's say we decide the 20
 
02:41:33.170 --> 02:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
million for the mmis thing which of
 
02:41:35.389 --> 02:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
course we're not going to do but if we
 
02:41:37.250 --> 02:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
decide that 20 million we're going to
 
02:41:39.170 --> 02:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
cut that and save that off the budget
 
02:41:43.929 --> 02:41:43.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:47.889 --> 02:41:47.899 align:start position:0%
I think it depends what you do with it
 
02:41:50.450 --> 02:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
well what you said a few minutes ago is
 
02:41:52.010 --> 02:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
exactly true if you don't spend it on
 
02:41:53.570 --> 02:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
anything else it goes into the rainy day
 
02:41:55.070 --> 02:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
fund and then it's effectively
 
02:41:57.889 --> 02:41:57.899 align:start position:0%
unavailable to spend in 24 25 unless you
 
02:41:59.450 --> 02:41:59.460 align:start position:0%
dip into the rainy day fund which is
 
02:42:01.429 --> 02:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
much harder to do which is one of the
 
02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
reasons that you see all of the spending
 
02:42:05.690 --> 02:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 23 is the governor is spending
 
02:42:08.270 --> 02:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
it down before it goes into the rainy
 
02:42:11.030 --> 02:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:20.290 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:42:20.290 --> 02:42:20.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:23.090 --> 02:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm just thinking you know the
 
02:42:25.969 --> 02:42:25.979 align:start position:0%
two-year 24-25 is the governor's budget
 
02:42:27.290 --> 02:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
but you're absolutely right your
 
02:42:29.270 --> 02:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
semantics were perfect and when we
 
02:42:31.490 --> 02:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
discuss sorry when we discuss a total
 
02:42:33.110 --> 02:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
the governor presented a budget with
 
02:42:36.469 --> 02:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
this total it includes all of this in
 
02:42:40.190 --> 02:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
hb2 and these two oh I got I got a nerve
 
02:42:42.770 --> 02:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
and the 23
 
02:42:44.870 --> 02:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
well it does depend on how you define
 
02:42:46.490 --> 02:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
the budget if you're defining it as
 
02:42:47.870 --> 02:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill one then no it doesn't
 
02:42:49.490 --> 02:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
include the 23 money but if you're
 
02:42:51.050 --> 02:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
looking at the governor's Surplus
 
02:42:53.090 --> 02:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
statement or the Surplus statement that
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
our office will put together for the
 
02:42:56.450 --> 02:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
legislature then yes it will show that
 
02:42:58.429 --> 02:42:58.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 spending
 
02:42:58.439 --> 02:43:01.250 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 spending
okay

02:43:01.250 --> 02:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:04.429 --> 02:43:04.439 align:start position:0%
if this was easy everyone could do it so
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
go ahead so I just want to check with
 
02:43:09.110 --> 02:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
Kevin about something else so people
 
02:43:12.170 --> 02:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
toss around the number of 131 million
 
02:43:16.309 --> 02:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
dollars uh revenues are less 131 million
 
02:43:18.469 --> 02:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
dollars from the governor's budget and
 
02:43:20.270 --> 02:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
when they say that they're talking about
 
02:43:21.830 --> 02:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget as being House
 
02:43:25.010 --> 02:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:27.469 --> 02:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
um his the house Revenue estimates are
 
02:43:30.110 --> 02:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
131 million below the governor over the
 
02:43:34.010 --> 02:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
three-year period 23 24 25.
 
02:43:34.020 --> 02:43:35.690 align:start position:0%
three-year period 23 24 25.
um

02:43:35.690 --> 02:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
so the other thing which I've mentioned
 
02:43:39.770 --> 02:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
before is yes the revenue estimates are
 
02:43:41.870 --> 02:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
lower but the governor also had about a
 
02:43:44.870 --> 02:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
330 million dollar uh cushion if you
 
02:43:47.030 --> 02:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
will in that he put money into the rainy
 
02:43:49.730 --> 02:43:49.740 align:start position:0%
day fund at the end of 23 he put money
 
02:43:51.429 --> 02:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
into the rainy day fund at the end of 25
 
02:43:54.170 --> 02:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
and he leaves funds in the education
 
02:43:56.389 --> 02:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
trust fund at the end of 25. so if you
 
02:43:58.490 --> 02:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
add those three things together the
 
02:44:02.090 --> 02:44:02.100 align:start position:0%
governor had about 330 million to spare
 
02:44:04.370 --> 02:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
so the house
 
02:44:06.650 --> 02:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
You could argue has about 200 million
 
02:44:08.929 --> 02:44:08.939 align:start position:0%
dollars to spare but again that split
 
02:44:11.090 --> 02:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
between the education and trust fund and
 
02:44:12.889 --> 02:44:12.899 align:start position:0%
the general fund and is split over the
 
02:44:15.170 --> 02:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
three years so how you choose to
 
02:44:17.870 --> 02:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
allocate That Money Matters
 
02:44:20.330 --> 02:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
which is why I would be leery of taking
 
02:44:22.910 --> 02:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
too much out of 23 and putting it into
 
02:44:29.570 --> 02:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:31.730 --> 02:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
okay so that's a general caution be
 
02:44:35.030 --> 02:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
careful moving 23 money into the future
 
02:44:37.610 --> 02:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
okay is there anything specific that
 
02:44:39.770 --> 02:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
you've seen in hb2 that we should
 
02:44:45.290 --> 02:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:47.389 --> 02:44:47.399 align:start position:0%
no I don't think so
 
02:44:49.849 --> 02:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
um my only thought is if I were looking
 
02:44:51.770 --> 02:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
to move money between years I would be
 
02:44:53.690 --> 02:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
trying to find one-time expenditures in
 
02:44:56.450 --> 02:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
24 25 that you could move into 23 rather
 
02:45:00.349 --> 02:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:00.359 --> 02:45:01.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:45:01.790 --> 02:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:45:03.830 --> 02:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:06.230 align:start position:0%
all right
um

02:45:06.230 --> 02:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:07.490 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:45:07.490 --> 02:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:45:10.070 --> 02:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
where are we two thirds did we just do
 
02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:16.969 align:start position:0%
where are we two thirds did we just do
239

02:45:16.969 --> 02:45:16.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:20.630 --> 02:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
to 241 yes you're on 241 which
 
02:45:23.450 --> 02:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
appropriates 533 000 for the purpose of
 
02:45:32.690 --> 02:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:35.690 --> 02:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
so is that 23 money
 
02:45:39.110 --> 02:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
it says it is huh is it
 
02:45:42.590 --> 02:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
yes it should be a one-time project does
 
02:45:45.889 --> 02:45:45.899 align:start position:0%
that meet the Ripple criteria
 
02:45:47.450 --> 02:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I have a specific
 
02:45:47.460 --> 02:45:48.830 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I have a specific
criteria

02:45:48.830 --> 02:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:50.929 align:start position:0%
criteria
um

02:45:50.929 --> 02:45:50.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:53.690 --> 02:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
my only my only thought is as I said if
 
02:45:54.710 --> 02:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
you see anything that looks like
 
02:45:56.510 --> 02:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
one-time spending consider spending it
 
02:45:59.090 --> 02:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
out of 23.
 
02:46:00.830 --> 02:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
can I ask him a question go ahead so I
 
02:46:02.210 --> 02:46:02.220 align:start position:0%
get that that makes perfect sense to me
 
02:46:03.710 --> 02:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
but how do we get the budget to look
 
02:46:05.870 --> 02:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
right I mean in the long run because the
 
02:46:07.969 --> 02:46:07.979 align:start position:0%
problem is doing next time we're on the
 
02:46:09.650 --> 02:46:09.660 align:start position:0%
budget cycle it's not clear what was
 
02:46:09.660 --> 02:46:10.490 align:start position:0%
budget cycle it's not clear what was
spent

02:46:10.490 --> 02:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
spent
 
02:46:12.710 --> 02:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
in past budgets and and I do understand
 
02:46:14.389 --> 02:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
that and if you're comparing House Bill
 
02:46:16.190 --> 02:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
one from one biennium to the next it
 
02:46:17.630 --> 02:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
will not show the whole picture and I
 
02:46:19.969 --> 02:46:19.979 align:start position:0%
completely agree in order to see the
 
02:46:21.530 --> 02:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
whole picture you would need to go to
 
02:46:24.670 --> 02:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:28.370 --> 02:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
which is why the the this principle
 
02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
seems to be important to me is that as
 
02:46:32.929 --> 02:46:32.939 align:start position:0%
much as possible we should be trying to
 
02:46:34.490 --> 02:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
make sure that we put operational
 
02:46:38.510 --> 02:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
ongoing monies into make sure that it
 
02:46:41.210 --> 02:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
that gets into HP one and then if we
 
02:46:44.210 --> 02:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
have a real one-time requirement put it
 
02:46:47.450 --> 02:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
into hb2 we agree yeah but he was sort
 
02:46:48.650 --> 02:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
of saying for instance a little while
 
02:46:50.210 --> 02:46:50.220 align:start position:0%
ago I asked him about putting a million
 
02:46:52.250 --> 02:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
dollars a year from base B2 and HP one
 
02:46:53.389 --> 02:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
he's kind of saying well we probably
 
02:46:55.370 --> 02:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do that that's not him and he
 
02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't singing directly but you but
 
02:46:58.969 --> 02:46:58.979 align:start position:0%
that's that's where it goes if you if
 
02:47:01.070 --> 02:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
you follow his and it's a good point
 
02:47:03.889 --> 02:47:03.899 align:start position:0%
that you suck it out of 23. because it's
 
02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
sitting there but the point is I was
 
02:47:07.610 --> 02:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
just trying to ask how do you balance
 
02:47:10.250 --> 02:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
that against getting the what you are
 
02:47:12.050 --> 02:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
just said getting the budgeting stream
 
02:47:12.060 --> 02:47:14.389 align:start position:0%
just said getting the budgeting stream
yeah

02:47:14.389 --> 02:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:47:17.929 --> 02:47:17.939 align:start position:0%
okay any any other go ahead could you
 
02:47:19.849 --> 02:47:19.859 align:start position:0%
just remind me what district offices is
 
02:47:21.469 --> 02:47:21.479 align:start position:0%
that we're moving
 
02:47:23.630 --> 02:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:47:24.950 --> 02:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
02:47:27.469 --> 02:47:27.479 align:start position:0%
I I believe
 
02:47:30.110 --> 02:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
um commissioner Weaver had reference to
 
02:47:31.969 --> 02:47:31.979 align:start position:0%
um Claremont is coming to mind that's
 
02:47:33.410 --> 02:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
been I know that's been a challenging
 
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
space okay thank you
 
02:47:38.630 --> 02:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
just a general comment that seems like a
 
02:47:40.790 --> 02:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
lot of money to move and that's what
 
02:47:43.250 --> 02:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
seems to be a small office but
 
02:47:46.450 --> 02:47:46.460 align:start position:0%
um but I'll I'll I'll leave that
 
02:47:53.210 --> 02:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:55.910 --> 02:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
section 243 appropriates two hundred
 
02:47:57.770 --> 02:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the replacement of
 
02:47:59.270 --> 02:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles and equipment at New Hampshire
 
02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:03.170 align:start position:0%
vehicles and equipment at New Hampshire
hospital

02:48:03.170 --> 02:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:07.429 --> 02:48:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:07.439 --> 02:48:11.090 align:start position:0%
 
next

02:48:11.090 --> 02:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:14.210 --> 02:48:14.220 align:start position:0%
section 245 appropriates 1.5 million
 
02:48:15.889 --> 02:48:15.899 align:start position:0%
dollars for the purpose of hiring I.T
 
02:48:17.990 --> 02:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
Consultants to manage projects and
 
02:48:20.510 --> 02:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
perform analysis to streamline business
 
02:48:20.520 --> 02:48:23.330 align:start position:0%
perform analysis to streamline business
processes

02:48:23.330 --> 02:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:25.490 --> 02:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
02:48:28.429 --> 02:48:28.439 align:start position:0%
so this gives me a rash because it feels
 
02:48:31.849 --> 02:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
to me like this these this consultancy
 
02:48:31.859 --> 02:48:32.929 align:start position:0%
to me like this these this consultancy
money

02:48:32.929 --> 02:48:32.939 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
ought to be associated with one of the
 
02:48:39.410 --> 02:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
projects like for example the Mi mmis is
 
02:48:41.210 --> 02:48:41.220 align:start position:0%
being funded
 
02:48:44.450 --> 02:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
the the project management cost should
 
02:48:46.849 --> 02:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
be part of those expenses for that
 
02:48:51.050 --> 02:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
entire effort and and so this seems to
 
02:48:53.809 --> 02:48:53.819 align:start position:0%
be sort of this free-floating group of
 
02:48:56.270 --> 02:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
Consultants that aren't attached to a
 
02:48:56.280 --> 02:48:58.790 align:start position:0%
Consultants that aren't attached to a
deliverable

02:48:58.790 --> 02:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:01.130 --> 02:49:01.140 align:start position:0%
so it may be best
 
02:49:03.349 --> 02:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
um to wait to have that discussion so I
 
02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
can have Dave leaders here so he can
 
02:49:06.950 --> 02:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
explain to you how this would work
 
02:49:08.210 --> 02:49:08.220 align:start position:0%
um particularly in support of our sales
 
02:49:14.630 --> 02:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:17.870 --> 02:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
okay so if it were tied to a specific
 
02:49:21.110 --> 02:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
system that would help and then if it
 
02:49:23.270 --> 02:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
were tied to a specific system that
 
02:49:27.530 --> 02:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
needed a one-time upgrade then living in
 
02:49:30.349 --> 02:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
hb2 is kind of compatible with the way I
 
02:49:33.710 --> 02:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
view this but just having humans
 
02:49:37.070 --> 02:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
coming in at an hb2 level and attached
 
02:49:40.370 --> 02:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
to anything just doesn't feel right
 
02:49:42.770 --> 02:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
sure yeah I'll I'll have Dave come down
 
02:49:44.690 --> 02:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
I'll see if he's available on Monday and
 
02:49:47.330 --> 02:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
we can get into specifics okay any
 
02:49:52.910 --> 02:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:56.809 align:start position:0%
 
247

02:49:56.809 --> 02:49:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:59.690 --> 02:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
so section 245 appropriated funds to
 
02:50:01.670 --> 02:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
manage projects and perform analysis
 
02:50:04.190 --> 02:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
section 247 appropriates funds to hire
 
02:50:06.410 --> 02:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
I.T Consultants to develop and Implement
 
02:50:08.150 --> 02:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
automated solutions to streamline
 
02:50:10.730 --> 02:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
business processes
 
02:50:18.309 --> 02:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:23.030 --> 02:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
249 249 appropriates 125 000 to replace
 
02:50:25.070 --> 02:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
a legacy database used for pulling
 
02:50:26.510 --> 02:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
quality samples for food stamp
 
02:50:33.950 --> 02:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:36.170 --> 02:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm feeling okay with that anyone
 
02:50:39.590 --> 02:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:42.349 --> 02:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
 
02:50:46.070 --> 02:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
section 251 appropriates 410 000 to
 
02:50:48.530 --> 02:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
replace switches routers routers and
 
02:50:50.570 --> 02:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
wireless access points at HHS district
 
02:50:50.580 --> 02:50:52.429 align:start position:0%
wireless access points at HHS district
offices

02:50:52.429 --> 02:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
offices
 
02:50:54.290 --> 02:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
okay this is where it gets a little
 
02:50:57.530 --> 02:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
dicey a lot of that feels like it wants
 
02:50:59.870 --> 02:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
to be one-time money but but when you
 
02:51:01.969 --> 02:51:01.979 align:start position:0%
get into something that has such a short
 
02:51:04.630 --> 02:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
life span like a switcher router
 
02:51:08.450 --> 02:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
Wireless Technologies it that to me that
 
02:51:10.550 --> 02:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
feel it feels like that really ought to
 
02:51:13.370 --> 02:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
be more on an operational side of the
 
02:51:13.380 --> 02:51:14.690 align:start position:0%
be more on an operational side of the
budget

02:51:14.690 --> 02:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:51:17.690 --> 02:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
do you have a difference
 
02:51:19.849 --> 02:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
well yes I mean it's the ones that are
 
02:51:21.469 --> 02:51:21.479 align:start position:0%
buying at one time and they're not that
 
02:51:23.450 --> 02:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
short-lived I mean these things will
 
02:51:25.429 --> 02:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
last three four five years at least you
 
02:51:28.309 --> 02:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
think the last over three years I have
 
02:51:29.870 --> 02:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
these things yes
 
02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
okay no I get that's that's a
 
02:51:35.690 --> 02:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
depreciation issue right yeah I mean if
 
02:51:37.670 --> 02:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's if it's if it's shorter than three
 
02:51:40.670 --> 02:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
years this should be operations money
 
02:51:43.429 --> 02:51:43.439 align:start position:0%
well you believe this is more than that
 
02:51:43.439 --> 02:51:44.590 align:start position:0%
well you believe this is more than that
that

02:51:44.590 --> 02:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:51:47.150 --> 02:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
the point is it's sort of one-time money
 
02:51:49.670 --> 02:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
for from and these things are not very
 
02:51:50.750 --> 02:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
expensive I mean I get what you're
 
02:51:52.190 --> 02:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
saying it's not a wrong it's not wrong
 
02:51:54.050 --> 02:51:54.060 align:start position:0%
but if you can suck it in and use it out
 
02:51:56.570 --> 02:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
of if they need them they need 400 000
 
02:51:59.269 --> 02:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
worth go out and buy them
 
02:52:01.910 --> 02:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay any comments other comments
 
02:52:01.920 --> 02:52:03.050 align:start position:0%
okay any comments other comments
questions

02:52:03.050 --> 02:52:03.060 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:52:03.060 --> 02:52:06.110 align:start position:0%
questions
okay

02:52:06.110 --> 02:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:08.870 --> 02:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
section 253 is the three million dollars
 
02:52:11.630 --> 02:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
per year and 24 and 25 to ensure that
 
02:52:13.010 --> 02:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
the TANF maintenance of effort
 
02:52:15.410 --> 02:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
requirement is met
 
02:52:18.110 --> 02:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
so we discussed this what what do you
 
02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
think the takeaway Mr White is for what
 
02:52:22.730 --> 02:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
we want to do with this line item what
 
02:52:24.830 --> 02:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
would the division three would like to
 
02:52:26.990 --> 02:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
do so just to see if you've heard us
 
02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.269 align:start position:0%
do so just to see if you've heard us
sure

02:52:29.269 --> 02:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:52:32.929 --> 02:52:32.939 align:start position:0%
um my unders I don't know if I heard a
 
02:52:35.090 --> 02:52:35.100 align:start position:0%
explicit conclusion but my understanding
 
02:52:37.550 --> 02:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
was there seemed to be an appetite for
 
02:52:43.550 --> 02:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:49.250 --> 02:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:51.230 --> 02:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
well so this would be an operating
 
02:52:53.210 --> 02:52:53.220 align:start position:0%
expense and it would be appropriate I
 
02:52:56.090 --> 02:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
think to put in house bill one in 2425 I
 
02:52:58.429 --> 02:52:58.439 align:start position:0%
still would like to get for the
 
02:53:00.769 --> 02:53:00.779 align:start position:0%
committee that breakout of TANF funds
 
02:53:02.510 --> 02:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the budget
 
02:53:02.520 --> 02:53:03.710 align:start position:0%
throughout the budget
um

02:53:03.710 --> 02:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:06.170 --> 02:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
and and admittedly part of my rationale
 
02:53:07.450 --> 02:53:07.460 align:start position:0%
for that is
 
02:53:09.889 --> 02:53:09.899 align:start position:0%
I looked at that breakout from two years
 
02:53:12.349 --> 02:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
ago and it looked like the maintenance
 
02:53:14.510 --> 02:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
of effort requirement was met and it
 
02:53:16.910 --> 02:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
seems to me that most of the funding is
 
02:53:19.130 --> 02:53:19.140 align:start position:0%
going up so I'm sort of wondering why
 
02:53:20.690 --> 02:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
the maintenance of effort requirement is
 
02:53:22.490 --> 02:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
not being met in the operating budget
 
02:53:24.769 --> 02:53:24.779 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be met here as well so I
 
02:53:25.969 --> 02:53:25.979 align:start position:0%
think seeing that breakout would
 
02:53:27.769 --> 02:53:27.779 align:start position:0%
probably be helpful for the committee
 
02:53:31.010 --> 02:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
okay but Mr White I think had the right
 
02:53:32.990 --> 02:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
summary Point we'd like to get it out of
 
02:53:35.870 --> 02:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
hb2 and into hb1 so that our maintenance
 
02:53:39.590 --> 02:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
of effort is is taken care of okay
 
02:53:44.929 --> 02:53:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is just the a place where I'd like
 
02:53:49.309 --> 02:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
to ask this question
 
02:53:52.969 --> 02:53:52.979 align:start position:0%
so we have a TANF Reserve fund is that
 
02:53:55.070 --> 02:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
correct yes
 
02:53:57.110 --> 02:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like thinking of a having a
 
02:53:59.809 --> 02:53:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:02.570 --> 02:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
it's off budget right I wish mine was
 
02:54:06.290 --> 02:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:08.330 --> 02:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
um how much is in the Tanner freezer
 
02:54:11.750 --> 02:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
fund at this point as of January 1 I I
 
02:54:13.630 --> 02:54:13.640 align:start position:0%
haven't checked it recently it was
 
02:54:17.630 --> 02:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
approximately 67 million dollars
 
02:54:21.769 --> 02:54:21.779 align:start position:0%
yeah and explain to us how that can be
 
02:54:21.779 --> 02:54:22.969 align:start position:0%
yeah and explain to us how that can be
used

02:54:22.969 --> 02:54:22.979 align:start position:0%
used
 
02:54:26.389 --> 02:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
so there are four general purposes that
 
02:54:28.730 --> 02:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
TANF can be used for I don't know them
 
02:54:30.530 --> 02:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head Chris I don't
 
02:54:32.450 --> 02:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
know if you
 
02:54:34.309 --> 02:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
have a better insight into historically
 
02:54:36.050 --> 02:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
what types of projects have been used
 
02:54:39.230 --> 02:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:41.750 --> 02:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
has the four purposes it's to maintain
 
02:54:44.150 --> 02:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm really paraphrasing right
 
02:54:46.190 --> 02:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
but it's like maintain two parent
 
02:54:48.769 --> 02:54:48.779 align:start position:0%
households to reduce
 
02:54:52.670 --> 02:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
um po poverty increased self-sufficiency
 
02:54:56.349 --> 02:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
so really the TANF balance dollars
 
02:54:59.510 --> 02:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
should really be used for programs in
 
02:55:02.990 --> 02:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
that area so that could be in some home
 
02:55:06.650 --> 02:55:06.660 align:start position:0%
visiting programs or child care you know
 
02:55:08.450 --> 02:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
if we use it
 
02:55:10.670 --> 02:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
um sometimes to avoid a wait list in
 
02:55:13.250 --> 02:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
child care we would then pull
 
02:55:15.590 --> 02:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
um our TANF balance dollars
 
02:55:19.190 --> 02:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
okay during the last budget
 
02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
in-house Bill two there was the
 
02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:23.210 align:start position:0%
in-house Bill two there was the
provision

02:55:23.210 --> 02:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
provision
 
02:55:25.190 --> 02:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
that if
 
02:55:28.250 --> 02:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
Child Care monies for the scholarships
 
02:55:30.130 --> 02:55:30.140 align:start position:0%
were drawn down
 
02:55:33.889 --> 02:55:33.899 align:start position:0%
that you could use TANF Reserve funds I
 
02:55:36.410 --> 02:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
think you had to come to fiscal to do it
 
02:55:38.690 --> 02:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
but they were some of those some of that
 
02:55:40.969 --> 02:55:40.979 align:start position:0%
67 million dollars could be used yeah
 
02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
that there wouldn't be a wait list and
 
02:55:45.650 --> 02:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
so that kids wouldn't lose child care in
 
02:55:48.889 --> 02:55:48.899 align:start position:0%
the middle of January or something and
 
02:55:52.130 --> 02:55:52.140 align:start position:0%
we chose we chose to not put it in the
 
02:55:54.830 --> 02:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
budget Child Care budget but to have the
 
02:55:58.490 --> 02:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
language that we can use TANF balance so
 
02:56:00.530 --> 02:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get tied up except it isn't
 
02:56:00.540 --> 02:56:03.050 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get tied up except it isn't
here

02:56:03.050 --> 02:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:05.510 --> 02:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
oh but I don't think we need I think we
 
02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
just have to go to fiscal to request a
 
02:56:12.550 --> 02:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:16.490 --> 02:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
see see which where do you see that if
 
02:56:18.650 --> 02:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
the child if a child care wait list
 
02:56:18.660 --> 02:56:20.809 align:start position:0%
the child if a child care wait list
develops

02:56:20.809 --> 02:56:20.819 align:start position:0%
develops
 
02:56:24.590 --> 02:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
that you could use TANF Reserve money by
 
02:56:26.809 --> 02:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
going to fiscal so we so we would just
 
02:56:28.309 --> 02:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
go through the standard accept and
 
02:56:30.290 --> 02:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
expend process to accept those federal
 
02:56:32.630 --> 02:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
dollars from the TANF Reserve into the
 
02:56:34.610 --> 02:56:34.620 align:start position:0%
budget to be able to spend those
 
02:56:38.030 --> 02:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
if we put that provision as it was in
 
02:56:40.730 --> 02:56:40.740 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 last time
 
02:56:42.650 --> 02:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have any problem with that
 
02:56:45.230 --> 02:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
because if you can do it anyway and we
 
02:56:48.110 --> 02:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
specify in House Bill 2 that you can do
 
02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:49.250 align:start position:0%
specify in House Bill 2 that you can do
it

02:56:49.250 --> 02:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:56:51.889 --> 02:56:51.899 align:start position:0%
I think it would make
 
02:56:54.650 --> 02:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
make it would actually I think make the
 
02:56:56.210 --> 02:56:56.220 align:start position:0%
Child Care Community feel more
 
02:56:59.090 --> 02:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
comfortable sure yeah yep yeah it was it
 
02:57:02.450 --> 02:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
was chapter 91 section 325 and it
 
02:57:04.670 --> 02:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
requires a quarterly report to fiscals
 
02:57:05.929 --> 02:57:05.939 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't look like fiscal committee
 
02:57:08.870 --> 02:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
approval was required yeah yep and so if
 
02:57:11.450 --> 02:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
we put that in there again
 
02:57:13.070 --> 02:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
we would not be opposed to that I'll
 
02:57:15.170 --> 02:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
continue to get the quarterly reports
 
02:57:19.670 --> 02:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
yep okay and I mean the division has to
 
02:57:22.070 --> 02:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
decide whether we put it in or not but I
 
02:57:23.990 --> 02:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
would like to see that provision put in
 
02:57:26.809 --> 02:57:26.819 align:start position:0%
again if possible I I I I haven't
 
02:57:28.670 --> 02:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
thought about it I'm open to listening
 
02:57:31.130 --> 02:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
to you but okay uh maybe we should maybe
 
02:57:33.769 --> 02:57:33.779 align:start position:0%
we can draft it up and if you see it in
 
02:57:37.070 --> 02:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
writing then it'll look there the 67
 
02:57:39.170 --> 02:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
million that's in in the piggy bank I
 
02:57:43.010 --> 02:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
think you referred to it as uh balance
 
02:57:47.269 --> 02:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
is that Federal money or state money
 
02:57:50.929 --> 02:57:50.939 align:start position:0%
it's federal dollars all right so we
 
02:57:54.050 --> 02:57:54.060 align:start position:0%
can't take the 67 million as a source to
 
02:57:58.090 --> 02:57:58.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:00.590 --> 02:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
I wasn't sure what kind of money we had
 
02:58:02.690 --> 02:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
sitting in the in the piggy bank
 
02:58:04.490 --> 02:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
all right go ahead
 
02:58:04.500 --> 02:58:05.510 align:start position:0%
all right go ahead
but

02:58:05.510 --> 02:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:58:07.730 --> 02:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
those funds could be used I mean just
 
02:58:09.710 --> 02:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
like if we had a wait list for child
 
02:58:12.469 --> 02:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
care they could be that's because
 
02:58:14.570 --> 02:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
so if our TANF
 
02:58:17.510 --> 02:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
roles increased
 
02:58:20.150 --> 02:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
they could be used to pay for our TANF
 
02:58:20.160 --> 02:58:21.170 align:start position:0%
they could be used to pay for our TANF
rolls

02:58:21.170 --> 02:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
rolls
 
02:58:24.410 --> 02:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
that would be appropriate
 
02:58:27.349 --> 02:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
yes and we also have used the TANF
 
02:58:29.630 --> 02:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
balance dollars to help us with some of
 
02:58:32.510 --> 02:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
our Cliff effect items to help families
 
02:58:34.429 --> 02:58:34.439 align:start position:0%
get you know
 
02:58:34.439 --> 02:58:35.210 align:start position:0%
get you know
um

02:58:35.210 --> 02:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:37.849 --> 02:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
mitigate the cliff effect knowing we had
 
02:58:40.790 --> 02:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
that TANF um balance dollars
 
02:58:43.429 --> 02:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
sure sure so I'm wrapping up now because
 
02:58:46.849 --> 02:58:46.859 align:start position:0%
uh the chairman uh needs this room at
 
02:58:49.670 --> 02:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
five o'clock and we should be clear and
 
02:58:51.290 --> 02:58:51.300 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to give the chairman back
 
02:58:52.490 --> 02:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
his room
 
02:58:57.410 --> 02:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
um uh to do a quick a quick wrap up uh I
 
02:59:00.410 --> 02:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
you know I we made good progress I I was
 
02:59:02.030 --> 02:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
thinking we could get through the entire
 
02:59:06.950 --> 02:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
thing but we didn't so one one do you
 
02:59:09.230 --> 02:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
think we could start biting at this
 
02:59:11.450 --> 02:59:11.460 align:start position:0%
again Monday or Tuesday I think Monday
 
02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
morning you could pick up right where
 
02:59:14.210 --> 02:59:14.220 align:start position:0%
you left off
 
02:59:14.220 --> 02:59:15.889 align:start position:0%
you left off
okay

02:59:15.889 --> 02:59:15.899 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:59:18.769 --> 02:59:18.779 align:start position:0%
um all right uh does anyone of the
 
02:59:20.750 --> 02:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
division have any final thoughts or
 
02:59:23.030 --> 02:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
comments that they'd like to make
 
02:59:25.190 --> 02:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple you have any
 
02:59:28.150 --> 02:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
final thoughts Mr White
 
02:59:32.870 --> 02:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
Chris yeah okay all right so with that I
 
02:59:34.250 --> 02:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
would say everyone have a great weekend
 
02:59:36.170 --> 02:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
if you drink don't drive if you drive
