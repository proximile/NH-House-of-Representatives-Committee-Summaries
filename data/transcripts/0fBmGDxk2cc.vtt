certainly appreciate the difficulties
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
the Senate uh created by putting these
 
00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
bills together you might consider it a
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps a tasting menu or sushi
 
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
um or uh you might consider it compost
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
or uh depending on what what committee
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
you're on but uh but here it is and
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
again I appreciate the um work from the
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
house chairs and others to see if we
 
00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:05.079 align:start position:0%
can't get through this um I am starting
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
with part two and uh just a little bit
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
of um background on this uh we actually
 
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
passed this last year in the Senate and
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
it got tied up in in in uh in covid um
 
00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:20.959 align:start position:0%
it is meant to renew our Solid Waste
 
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
reduction uh goal planning um this is
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
something that began in 1996 but was
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
then in ab bance and and uh it's been
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
really important to get this uh back in
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
place to do um Solid Waste Disposal
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
reduction um planning for the for the
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
state um this bill like House Bill 413
 
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
arose from the solid waste and recycling
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh committee chaired by representative
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
eel a couple of years ago a lot of great
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
ideas bipartisan unanimous came out of
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
that and uh so we have these um these
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
two two bills and um they're meant to to
 
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
work in Tandem and um to that end uh
 
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:07.160 align:start position:0%
after conversation and recommendation by
 
00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.350 align:start position:0%
after conversation and recommendation by
chairman

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:12.279 align:start position:0%
Rulo and um Pearl it seemed to make
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
sense that the Senate would amend House
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 413 which we had an energy natural
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
resource to add this bill um this
 
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
section to that which we have done uh
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday in um Senate energy and
 
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
natural resources thinking that that
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
might uh ease the process uh for for the
 
00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
house um so let me um describe the bill
 
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
um for for you uh the real impetus here
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
is the need to reduce our Solid Waste in
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
any way we can because of our landfills
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
starting to fill up and also you know if
 
00:12:48.189 --> 00:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
you talk to your municipalities you know
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
that you've seen a doubling and
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes tripling of tipping fees and
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's just really hammering local
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
taxpayers municipalities and so if we
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
can find ways to increase Recycling and
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
find markets for that and if we can find
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
ways to reduce Solid Waste we're going
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
to save taxpayers a lot of money and
 
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
also extend the life of our Our Land um
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
landfills um the bill was created uh
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
with with Dees of course um but also
 
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
working very closely with the waste
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
management companies you know cassella
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
um waste management and others uh to
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that we had a bill that
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
everybody thought um could work so just
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
to briefly look at the bill you'll see
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
that what it does is it sets some some
 
00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:31.389 align:start position:0%
that what it does is it sets some some
goals

00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
goals
 
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
for reduction of 25% by 2030 and 45% by
 
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
the year uh
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
2050 and some very careful definitions
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
of what gets counted in that goal that
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
uh the you know the Practical folks are
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
our managers and the municipalities and
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
uh the folks at the landfill said this
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of way to do that that
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh that makes um makes sense and these
 
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
um go goals are are similar to goals in
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
other other states and they're ones that
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
the dees really felt this is doable that
 
00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:08.759 align:start position:0%
we we can get there on uh on these goals
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
over over 10 years um then um going
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
downward down a little bit uh it says
 
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
that we'll get an update every couple
 
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
years um from Dees on how uh this is
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
this is going and then um some
 
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:25.959 align:start position:0%
discussion of you know how this is going
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
to go forward with goals and strategies
 
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
opportun ities um on reduction on
 
00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
Recycling and here's where House Bill
 
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
4113 is going to play such a crucial
 
00:14:38.829 --> 00:14:38.839 align:start position:0%
role because that committee uh has been
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
set up in order to kind of do a lot of
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
the background work that can then feed
 
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
into this plan and uh that that bill
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 413 carefully crafted the
 
00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
house passed it uh I guess on consent a
 
00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago and um it's a it's a great
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
Bill and so what that'll do is is uh
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
over the the next several months uh get
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of the information together that
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
then Dees and others can use in creating
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
uh creating the
 
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
plan um so that that's uh that's a
 
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
sketch of it and I'd be very happy to
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%

00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
you hear I I heard it yeah um and and
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you Mr Mr chairman I
 
00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:53.079 align:start position:0%
meant to mention that um in the
 
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
consultation about uh putting this um
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
part of the bill on to 413 the
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation from environment and
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
agriculture uh was that we make a slight
 
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
change on line 36 um the intent of this
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
Bill had always been to look at that
 
00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:15.799 align:start position:0%
that 25 and um 45% as aggregate goals um
 
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
and we thought it was important to take
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
out the language which seemed to imply
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
that in landfills and and incinerators
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
each had to meet that goal and so th
 
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
that those that little phrase um was
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
removed so it's just the overall amount
 
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
of waste dispose and we're going to
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
trust our managers and uh the solid
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
waste companies and incinerator
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
operators to figure out just you know
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
how how they all participate in
 
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
achieving the goals so it's important
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
that this not does not set separate hard
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
and fast goals for solid waste disposal
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
and for incineration it's the overall
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
goal here that counts and thank you Mr
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
chairman for your question thank thank
 
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
you Senator I appreciate that uh I'll
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
turn it over to any other members of the
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
ENA committee if there's any further
 
00:18:07.149 --> 00:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
questions that they would like to ask I
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
think the senator has done a pretty good
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
highlights Kelly has got a
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
question first first we just the
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
representatives of the ENA committee you
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
have any any
 
00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:27.310 align:start position:0%
have any any
questions

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
Sen I don't see any hands from my
 
00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:30.870 align:start position:0%
Sen I don't see any hands from my
committee

committee
 
00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:35.559 align:start position:0%
members I'll I'll open open up
 
00:18:35.559 --> 00:18:38.390 align:start position:0%
members I'll I'll open open up
to

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
representa representative
 
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
Kelly I just had my hand up about the
 
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
microphone issue so I don't have a
 
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.909 align:start position:0%
microphone issue so I don't have a
question

00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
okay microphone okay now this yeah it's
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
working great yep I hear perfectly thank
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
you uh yes representative M Mr chairman
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator thank you for your
 
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
introduction and and uh the goals of
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
this bill are are right on target my my
 
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
question though is as a citizen what
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
does this mean to make because it's the
 
00:19:12.669 --> 00:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
citizens and businesses that create the
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
Refuge so how does this bill what are
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
the teeth in this bill that say okay
 
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
we're not going to create as
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
much well thanks for the question and
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
and really your question gets to the
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
heart of it as as I said that you know
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
we're really facing a problem with
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
solving Solid Waste capacity in the
 
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
state and um we felt that this bill if
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
we didn't do anything that the costs for
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
citizens are going to go up and up and
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
up I mean I I got to tell you in Dover
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
that we have the pay as you throw bags
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
and the price has gone up from like a190
 
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
to 425 a bag and um it's it's just it's
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
really getting to be crushing on
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
Municipal um budgets is seven several
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
million more in some of my my uh
 
00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
communities over in District 4 so um the
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
way to help out local taxpayers is to
 
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
provide programs um to to help provide
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
markets and uh programs to make
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
recycling easier that all help that
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
ought to help businesses a lot with
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
their tipping fees as well and um then
 
00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:21.799 align:start position:0%
you know through composting which is a
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
big interest of um uh of uh
 
00:20:26.909 --> 00:20:26.919 align:start position:0%
representative eel and and others coming
 
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
out of that Solid Waste uh uh committee
 
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
um and diversion uh there are some good
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
ways to do that as well so um the point
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
is that you know the industry and you
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
know the the New England recycling um
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
Group which you know has all kinds of
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
Grants and programs to help
 
00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:45.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities out in these areas
 
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
they're ready to go there's a lot of new
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
technology a lot of a lot of activities
 
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
um it looks like we're getting the
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
markets back in some of the recycling
 
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
with the opening up of the uh pulp
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
recycling plan up in up in Maine and a
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
lot of promising things developing on
 
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
Plastics as well so um I think we're
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
going to get there and uh to me it's
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
just it's saving the taxpayer dollars
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's bottom line for
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
me for a follow Mr for a followup thank
 
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
you just to to just to confirm what you
 
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
just said to make sure I understand that
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
this is focused on the industry figuring
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
out ways what to do with the waste
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
rather than the citizens and businesses
 
00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:30.029 align:start position:0%
rather than the citizens and businesses
less

00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:30.039 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
waste well thanks for that I mean I
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
think it's a flow um you know if we
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
encourage local composting um if we find
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
good markets for um recycling it means
 
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
you know municipalities rather than
 
00:21:46.269 --> 00:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
sending materials off to the landfill
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
and paying for tipping costs can have a
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
market in the municipality um you know
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
they might get a grant to get them get
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
get a bailer so they can bail their uh
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
materials and um and sell them and that
 
00:21:59.549 --> 00:21:59.559 align:start position:0%
that's another that's a good way of
 
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
reducing reducing costs I think also too
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know there's just lots of
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
educational programs that um can be done
 
00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
to encourage people to to think about um
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
ways of reducing uh packaging or you
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
know think about ways of uh of um you
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
know using refillable thises and that I
 
00:22:20.669 --> 00:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's consumer Choice um but to
 
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
me if you if in a way it gets
 
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
incentivized that you see that you're
 
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
going to save yourself and maybe your
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
community some money it uh you know kind
 
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
this represent Smith uh representative
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
Smith for a
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking my question uh my
 
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
question is uh concerning page four
 
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
lines five six and seven um and when
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
we're discussing Solid
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
Waste we're to excluding automobile scra
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
auto motor vehicle waste infectious
 
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
waste asbest contaminated soil and I
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
just you know I know some of these
 
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.590 align:start position:0%
just you know I know some of these
things

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
are uh recyclable or reusable and others
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
are just playing bad uh you know
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
hazardous uh things and I just wondered
 
00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:17.799 align:start position:0%
what was the reasoning for excluding all
 
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
of those oh thanks so much for that
 
00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:22.039 align:start position:0%
question I mean this is really important
 
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
for the industry and it kind of
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
recognizes the way materials are handled
 
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
um a lot of these materials are are
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
governed like ASB bestus of course um
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
contaminated Sals are governed by um
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
various you know statutes and uh Federal
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
Regulation and so on and there are
 
00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
programs set up for
 
00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
them and um it's not as if you can kind
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
of necessarily reduce reduce those uh
 
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
they have to get handled and so since
 
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
there's a kind of a an amount there that
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
you know you have to deal with and there
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
special programs for them it it seemed
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
um honorous then to include that because
 
00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
if you're you're not going to be able to
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
reduce th that amount um then it means
 
00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
like you've got to double down on
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
reducing everything else so this kind of
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
recognizes the way these materials are
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
are handled and um because they can't
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
realistically be included in a goal for
 
00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
reduction because they're handled
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
differently um they're excluded from the
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
goal here I hope that makes
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
sense a little bit thank
 
00:24:27.389 --> 00:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
you and let me say and thanks for your
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
question but I think if we have um Mike
 
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
whims or others from Dees here they can
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
tell you a little bit more about how
 
00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
these programs are set up for those
 
00:24:35.159 --> 00:24:37.590 align:start position:0%
these programs are set up for those
materials

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
thanks any anyone else uh from the from
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
from the committee No
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
Hands okay uh just a a question on
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
procedure uh Senator Waters uh are do
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
you want to to speak on every
 
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh portion of the uh of the B of the
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
bill now or you going to uh follow along

well Mr chairman I I'm really at your at
 
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
your call and it seems to me it might be
 
00:25:23.789 --> 00:25:23.799 align:start position:0%
um more useful if I just kind of waited
 
00:25:27.149 --> 00:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
my turn on the other parts and um maybe
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%

New London and Newbury um I listened to
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
the testimony presented by Senator
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
Waters and he covered a great deal of um
 
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
information about this part
 
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.470 align:start position:0%
information about this part
um

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:35.799 align:start position:0%
the I was the uh chair of the recycling
 
00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:40.039 align:start position:0%
committee which um I introduced a um a
 
00:27:43.389 --> 00:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
bill a couple of years ago when I heard
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of information about China
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
not taking a lot of our refu and we
 
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
created a recycling study committee and
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
I would say that it was it it turned
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
into quite um an adventure
 
00:28:02.669 --> 00:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
we uh we had um over 50 people
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
testifying in our committee on a wide
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
variety of topics we tried to bring in
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
all the stakeholders we could think of
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh businesses municipalities
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
recyclers um we had 14 hearings and it
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
was eight weeks and we generated um a
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
comprehensive report which was on a
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
great deal more than recycling it was
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
also uh generally on the situation with
 
00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Management in the state of
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which we've been managing
 
00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:41.799 align:start position:0%
all right but honestly you know when you
 
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
start to have problems that's when the
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
cracks start to show and we saw an awful
 
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
lot of uh cracks and some abysses out
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
there um so we made quite a few
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
recommendations in my testimony I gave
 
00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
you the link to our
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
report um I also gave you some
 
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
information regarding landfill capacity
 
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and um and
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
all of that sort of thing there were
 
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
several recommendations that were
 
00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:15.799 align:start position:0%
particularly um important coming out of
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
this uh study committee which are
 
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
embodied in this bill and the bill that
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters referred to
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
hb413 which pass the house that creates
 
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
um a solid waste task force to work with
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
Dees um it also puts a deadline on the
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
production of the uh composting
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
regulations by Dees that we've been
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
waiting for for quite long time this
 
00:29:49.149 --> 00:29:49.159 align:start position:0%
bill as Senator Waters uh
 
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
described uh basically
 
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
recasts the way that we're going to be
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
um seeking uh Solid Waste diversion in
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire the last uh
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
time that we looked at this was in the
 
00:30:10.029 --> 00:30:10.039 align:start position:0%
late 90s and the statutes currently
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
require us to achieve a
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
40% reduction in our Solid Waste by the
 
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
year 2000 so you can see that is really
 
00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:23.559 align:start position:0%
really out of date um also the way that
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh it was set up in the statute for that
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh wayss to be tracked is not something
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
that really works for the department at
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
all so what we did um as you can see in
 
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:36.630 align:start position:0%
all so what we did um as you can see in
the

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
bill we um and I won't go through all
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
the details of it but we tried to make
 
00:30:45.509 --> 00:30:45.519 align:start position:0%
it a two-step uh goal one for what our
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
goal was by 2030 and then another goal
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
for uh about 20 years later I remember
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
right I'm not looking at it it's 25 and
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
45% respectively and the
 
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
um uh also as Senator Waters said we
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
work closely with them on making sure
 
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
that we established uh uh methodology
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
for these goals to be achieved in a way
 
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
that reflects what's actually trackable
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire um I just
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
want to take an opportunity at this
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
point I know the members of the ENA
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
committee have heard this uh we really
 
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
have a problem in the state of New
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the landfill capacity that
 
00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
we have is is
 
00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
dwindling um and I'm not here to uh
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
testify in favor of ever increasing
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
landfill capacity because in our
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
hierarchy of what we do with our Solid
 
00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
Waste um landfilling is the last uh last
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
thing we should be doing we should be
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
trying to reduce our waste in different
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
ways um but our go-to me method has been
 
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
landfilling the decrease in the capacity
 
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
as increased tipping fees I know there
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
was a question earlier about the effects
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
on of of what we're trying to do here um
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities in particular are really
 
00:32:14.509 --> 00:32:14.519 align:start position:0%
feeling the pinch because of increased
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
tipping fees
 
00:32:20.629 --> 00:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
um and unfortunately uh the other part
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
of what we're talking about in this bill
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
is recasting our solid long range Solid
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
Waste plan program it had been set up um
 
00:32:32.629 --> 00:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
for every six years we're going to
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
extend that to 10 years with this bill
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
to try to give more um really long range
 
00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
planning opportunity than was provided
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
by the six-year uh program um it needs
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
to be said that we have not had a long
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
range Solid Waste plan in the state of
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire even though we're required
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
by Statute to have one every six years
 
00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.590 align:start position:0%
by Statute to have one every six years
since

00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
2003 this puts us at a great
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
disadvantage because all around the
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
region other states are doing a lot of
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
planning on how to manage an issue that
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
affects every single person in the state
 
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and every entity these
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
regions among other things are doing um
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste bans which bans certain
 
00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
items from being landfilled and when you
 
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
can't landfill it in your state and you
 
00:33:28.029 --> 00:33:28.039 align:start position:0%
have a cheap way of getting rid of it in
 
00:33:28.039 --> 00:33:29.350 align:start position:0%
have a cheap way of getting rid of it in
another

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
state in some cases uh other states are
 
00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:35.799 align:start position:0%
looking at New Hampshire um this doesn't
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
put us in a good uh place and we're not
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
able to ban out of state waste um under
 
00:33:44.909 --> 00:33:44.919 align:start position:0%
the interstate commerce clause so we
 
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
really have to start developing
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
methodologies to uh
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
conserve um opportunities for the for
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
the people of our state um the other
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
thing and by and by doing more long
 
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
range planning I think we can spur
 
00:34:06.029 --> 00:34:06.039 align:start position:0%
additional businesses using re reuse and
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
recycling uh we can do more composting
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of opportunities out there
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
that because we really haven't had any
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
kind of a plan since uh 2003 and a lot
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
of our permitting and other decisions
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
are based on a 2003 plan we need to get
 
00:34:28.829 --> 00:34:28.839 align:start position:0%
with the pro program um this bill will
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
help a lot in that respect and I hope to
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
get your support and I'm happy to take
 
00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
you all right are there any members of B
 
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
that have any questions for
 
00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:49.430 align:start position:0%
that have any questions for
representative

00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
EV I do not
 
00:34:56.589 --> 00:34:56.599 align:start position:0%
see all right is there any uh members of
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh resources that have questions of
 
00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:07.150 align:start position:0%
uh resources that have questions of
Representative

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
eel you this is
 
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079 align:start position:0%
represent representative eil does this
 
00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
do these numbers of reduction um are
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
they based on a stable population growth
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
through year 2030 or what is that thank
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
you um I would I would defer to uh Dees
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
because we discussed this quite a bit
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
with them um I would say that it would
 
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate some increase in um in
 
00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.670 align:start position:0%
anticipate some increase in um in
population

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
um and also some business growth you
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
know uh you have to take a lot of things
 
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
into consideration when you take a t
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
take a goal like this and put it into
 
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
place and the other thing we looked at
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
in addition to popula we didn't specific
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
speically look at population we looked
 
00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:09.079 align:start position:0%
methodologies thank you any other
 
00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative by
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
members of RA
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
resources no questions seeing no
 
00:36:23.069 --> 00:36:23.079 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
testimony uh I will now call
 
00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:29.319 align:start position:0%

00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
okay good morning uh can you hear me uh
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
yes we can sorry about the delay it it
 
00:36:58.589 --> 00:36:58.599 align:start position:0%
had me rejoin the meeting I guess um so
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Michael norc I
 
00:37:03.069 --> 00:37:03.079 align:start position:0%
am with the solid waste management
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
Bureau at
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
De um and uh wanted to provide some
 
00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
testimony uh in support of part two of
 
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 146 I think Senator Waters
 
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
did a great job setting it up and
 
00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
representative eel also provided a lot
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
of great context so for the sake of time
 
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
uh I'll keep it pretty brief I also
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
provided uh WR testimony to members of
 
00:37:31.309 --> 00:37:31.319 align:start position:0%
um resources Recreation and development
 
00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we provided written
 
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
testimony to Anda but we can do that as
 
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
well just for context um but anyway I
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
just for for the sake of time I just
 
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
that one of the primary reasons that
 
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
Dees supports part two of this uh
 
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill is that it would
 
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
essentially reframe a goal that has been
 
00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
as representative eel noted
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh many decades out of date uh it would
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
reframe it from something that is
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to measure to something
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
that would be much easier for us to
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
measure and if we're going to set a goal
 
00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
it's very important to be able to
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
measure it so that we can track progress
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
towards achieving that goal one of the
 
00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
problems that we've had with the current
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
goal is that it requires the department
 
00:38:22.589 --> 00:38:22.599 align:start position:0%
to track data that we don't readily have
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
available um it wants um
 
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
basically it wants us to track
 
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
generation of waste throughout the state
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately that's not something
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
that we're set up to easily do um we
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
regulate Solid Waste facilities and so
 
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
therefore we can only track what's
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
reported to us from those Solid Waste
 
00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
facilities and and unfortunately in the
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
world of solid waste not everything goes
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
through a solid waste facility so there
 
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
are some indeterminable amounts of waste
 
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
that are not sent to a solid waste
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
facility they might be generated
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know at a household and managed
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
at the household or you know things go
 
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
to donation or recycling that are
 
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
outside of the typical Solid Waste um
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so that's one of the
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
primary problems with the current goal
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
is that it requires us to measure
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
something that we don't re really have a
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
way of measuring very easily um
 
00:39:23.309 --> 00:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
and what this what Senate Bill uh 146
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
part two would do it would essentially
 
00:39:29.069 --> 00:39:29.079 align:start position:0%
reframe the goal from a diversion goal
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
to a disposal reduction goal and I know
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
that sounds kind of jargony but the the
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
whole idea is that it would allow us to
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
take data that we already have because
 
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
landfills and incinerators report to us
 
00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
annually how much tonnage they are
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
processing um and so we can take that
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
data and it is definitive data and we
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
can track that over time to see if there
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
are changes and use that as a kind of an
 
00:39:58.309 --> 00:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
indicator for um you know if changes in
 
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
disposal um happen over the course of
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
several years we can use that as an
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
indicator for um waste reduction or
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
recycling um and so those are ways for
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
us to at least have a definitive um
 
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
metric that we can use to track progress
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
towards achieving these
 
00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:20.839 align:start position:0%
targets um and I think that that
 
00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
basically uh is all I wanted to to say
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
right now but if there are any questions
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
from either committee
 
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
um happy to to take those questions
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
now thank you chair chairman
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
Howard jman
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
Pearl hi the works thank you are there
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
any questions from the members of the
 
00:40:42.359 --> 00:40:47.910 align:start position:0%
any questions from the members of the
ENA

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
committee I do not see any Mr
 
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
chair thank thank you all right uh
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly from resource es
 
00:40:59.950 --> 00:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
you recognized for a question thank you
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr nor for being
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
here today um just a quick question you
 
00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
said that the uh tonnage numbers are
 
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
reported by the landfills annually are
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
is that just a one annual uh report or
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
do they report like monthly
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
numbers thank thank you representative
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
Kelly for the question
 
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
um the the data that we tend to use is
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
it's from an annual facility report so
 
00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
it is something that's reported to us in
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
aggregate for the whole year um some of
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
the facilities do like like the
 
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
landfills for example will provide us
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
quarterly or in some cases monthly
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
reports of the tonnage um but they kind
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
of um use the annual facility report as
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
a way to kind of
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's a way for them to
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
um reconcile the numbers for the year
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
some sometimes there are going to be
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies with those monthly
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
reports so we tend to follow what they
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
report annually just as a way
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
of as as more reliable
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
data okay thank
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from uh
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
resources so representative Smith had
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
her hand up and she load it
 
00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
representative Smith you have you had
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
your hand up and lowered it is that your
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr nor for taking my question um I'm
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
going to go back to the question I asked
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
of the crie sponsor about the exclusion
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
of automobile scrap absorbent media
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
contaminated soil uh industrial process
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
waste um he indicated that you could
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
explain better um because I was left
 
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
with a couple of questions still after
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
uh his so I just wondered um if you
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
could explain I understand that some are
 
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
already covered by Statute like asbestos
 
00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
but if you could
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
explain uh why they are Exempted like
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
ash from wood stoves and uh
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
sludge thank you representative Smith I
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
I neglected to I do recall you asking
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
that earlier and I neglected to touch on
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
that in my testimony so thanks for
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
bringing it back up
 
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
um the the idea here I believe as I
 
00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.870 align:start position:0%
um the the idea here I believe as I
recall

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
recall
 
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
was uh some of the landfill operators
 
00:43:23.069 --> 00:43:23.079 align:start position:0%
were concerned about um looking at Solid
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
Waste as a whole because there are
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
certain segments of solid waste that
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
there really aren't any good
 
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
alternatives for like you can't really
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
recycle um contaminated soil eat very
 
00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
easily or asbest there's just nothing
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
you can really do with asbest except
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
dispose of it in a landfill um so they
 
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
were concern that if we were looking um
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
inclusively at all solid waste and
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
trying to and trying to reduce it by 25%
 
00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
in the next 10 years or 45% in the next
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
20 years or 30 years
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
um that it would kind of put them at a
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
disadvantage because there are just some
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
things like what's excluded here in in
 
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
this section on on page four um that are
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
just it's there's nothing you can really
 
00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:12.559 align:start position:0%
do with it except send it for disposal
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
so they wanted to kind of exclude that
 
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
from the the what the the goal was
 
00:44:21.069 --> 00:44:21.079 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve because um so they're
 
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
trying to focus on the segments of the
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
solid waste stream that have reasonable
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
um opportunities for diversion or
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
recycling does that answer your question
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
does that make
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
sense uh yes but I do have a followup Mr
 
00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
chair if that's okay for a followup yeah
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
so um in looking at sludge I know that
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
and also the ash I know like it locally
 
00:44:50.549 --> 00:44:50.559 align:start position:0%
here we have a resource management and
 
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
their business is recycling or reusing
 
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
repurposing sludge and AD
 
00:44:59.710 --> 00:44:59.720 align:start position:0%
to make a fertilizer and I just wondered
 
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
you know is there just not enough want
 
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
need for that kind of stuff so uh that's
 
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
a great question and one of the things
 
00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
to clarify here is that it's um the the
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
use of the term Ash here is specifically
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
regarding U for example U you know Ash
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
from incineration of Municipal Solid
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
Waste okay what RMI manages is typically
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
um ash from wood like burning of biomass
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
or or other forms of wood and that is
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
not um there's a separate segment of our
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
our rules related to
 
00:45:42.549 --> 00:45:42.559 align:start position:0%
um ash from from burning of wood and
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
that's something that can be land
 
00:45:46.589 --> 00:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
applied for as you noted um you know
 
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
agronomic benefit um and with sludge yes
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities to use it for
 
00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
land application
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
um I think think there are growing
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
concerns about management of sludge in
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
general just because of the issues
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
related to pest um so in some cases
 
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
sludge is being disposed in landfills
 
00:46:10.109 --> 00:46:10.119 align:start position:0%
and that this is something that's been
 
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
going on for a long time even before PFS
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
that sludge has been being disposed in
 
00:46:16.349 --> 00:46:16.359 align:start position:0%
in landfills I think there's also
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
economic concerns related to management
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
of sludge and some in some cases I think
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
disposal in a landfill is the most
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
economical for
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
so yeah sludge is a is a kind of a a
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
tricky issue because it's it's only
 
00:46:35.549 --> 00:46:35.559 align:start position:0%
regulated as a solid waste if it's in a
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
landfill otherwise it's actually
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
regulated under RSA 485a which is a
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
whole separate statutory being water
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
program um and so I think the reason it
 
00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
was included here is that if sludge ends
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
up in a
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
landfill um that it would be excluded
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
from the goal but there are
 
00:46:57.309 --> 00:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities to use sludge and other in
 
00:46:57.319 --> 00:46:59.069 align:start position:0%
opportunities to use sludge and other in
other

00:46:59.069 --> 00:46:59.079 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
ways okay thank
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
you yeah uh representative Kon thank you
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh Mr nor thank you for your
 
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.549 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh Mr nor thank you for your
testimony

00:47:10.549 --> 00:47:10.559 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
I why is it that you think that this
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
bill which sets goals which are which
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
are good goals to set requires you then
 
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
to track data and and receive data from
 
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
um the company
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
why is it that you think that this will
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
actually reduce the amount of trash what
 
00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:33.319 align:start position:0%
what what is it about this bill that
 
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
that make that
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
happen thank you for the question
 
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
representative I
 
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
um this was a
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
a you know that this goal was first of
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
all the reason we we support this is
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
because this goal was out of date and we
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
needed to do something to update it so
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
that we have um no something to aim for
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that setting a goal in
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
statute um creates any mandate
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily in fact in the Senate um
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
Senator GAA requested that the language
 
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
be changed to State um it's on page
 
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
four lines nine and 10 that for the
 
00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
purposes of of this section goal shall
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
not shall not establish a mandate so
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this goal that would
 
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
actually um create a re requirement that
 
00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
the waste be reduced across the board
 
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
however it
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
creates um it creates kind of a a
 
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
and again it creates kind of a goal or
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
something a Target to aim at and I think
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
um it also creates legislative
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
intent uh for additional waste reduction
 
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
and diversion initiatives um either
 
00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.470 align:start position:0%
and diversion initiatives um either
through

00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
legislation um or it also creates an
 
00:48:59.470 --> 00:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
intent for the Department to create
 
00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
programs and planning that would help us
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
to achieve the goal um and and it's you
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
know something that is phased in um you
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
know there's there's two parts to this
 
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
there's the 10-year time frame where we
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
would hopefully be able to reduce
 
00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:17.799 align:start position:0%
25% of the Total Disposal tonnage and
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
then by
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
2045 um or by 2050 rather reducing that
 
00:49:26.109 --> 00:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
by 45% so it's trying to accommod
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
um you know a longer time frame so that
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
we can hopefully find ways to actually
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
achieve uh through you know actually
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of generation the
 
00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
total waste that we generate or finding
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
additional ways to recycle or divert
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
waste through composting or additional
 
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:47.480 align:start position:0%
um you know recycling programs like that
 
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
representative I I don't think there's
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
anything here that would definitively
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
make us achieve the goal but it creates
 
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
the intent and I think that that's
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's the place to start appreciate
 
00:50:02.349 --> 00:50:02.359 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
questions uh Mr uh representative Bixby
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
sir uh representative
 
00:50:14.109 --> 00:50:14.119 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes um just to follow up on the uh
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
previous uh question uh so uh are there
 
00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
ever grant
 
00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh that uh Dees may have
 
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
access to that would uh be uh useful in
 
00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
terms of getting funding to U meet these
 
00:50:33.789 --> 00:50:33.799 align:start position:0%
goals and would having these goals as
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
part of Statute uh strengthen such an an
 
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
grant thank you representative Bixby
 
00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um and that
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
really gets to the heart of the matter
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
of of how do we achieve these these
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
targets um one thing I just want to note
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
is that um many other states in the
 
00:50:58.789 --> 00:50:58.799 align:start position:0%
region have robust Grant programs for um
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
incentivizing Reuse Recycling waste
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
reduction composting you know all all of
 
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
those those things that help to reduce
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
the amount of waste we're sending into
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
to disposal facilities that's not
 
00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
something that we have the capacity for
 
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
um one of the reasons for that is that
 
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
the solid waste Bureau at Dees is 100%
 
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
General funded um and we used to have a
 
00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
whole section devoted to technical
 
00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:30.839 align:start position:0%
assistance and uh Community planning um
 
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
and that section was slowly through
 
00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:35.960 align:start position:0%
budget cuts it was essentially disbanded
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
and it no longer exists and that's part
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
of the reason why the solid waste
 
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
management plan hasn't been updated
 
00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:44.799 align:start position:0%
since 2003 that's part of the reason why
 
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
we don't have composting rules that are
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
up to date and that we've been
 
00:51:51.549 --> 00:51:51.559 align:start position:0%
struggling to to get those uh rules
 
00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
updated so there's a number of side
 
00:51:56.789 --> 00:51:56.799 align:start position:0%
effects um one of and another side
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
effect is that we don't have available
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
funding to provide grants um whereas
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts the grants that they hand
 
00:52:08.829 --> 00:52:08.839 align:start position:0%
out on a on an annual basis are well
 
00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
over our entire operating budget for the
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
solid waste management Bureau here at
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
Dees um so you know it's it I think you
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
know creating goals is one thing but
 
00:52:22.109 --> 00:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
actually being able to
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
incentivize um you know it's the carrot
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
and the stick kind of thing um you know
 
00:52:28.589 --> 00:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
if you have the carrot to help get to
 
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
that goal um you know that really makes
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
the the policy much more effective and
 
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we just don't have that
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
right now Senator Waters in addition to
 
00:52:41.309 --> 00:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
this bill last session did introduce uh
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
a bill that would establish a disposal
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
surcharge which would essentially go
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
into a dedicated fund and would be used
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
for um you know creating Grant programs
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
and technical assistance Outreach and
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
helping to fund D's work um and that
 
00:52:58.270 --> 00:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
bill obviously along with everything
 
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
else during Co really kind of Hit the
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
hit the rail the third rail um so you
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
know there are there are ways that we
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
can maybe in the future get to that but
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
right now representative Bixby we are
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
not in a position to be able to do that
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
um the only program that we have right
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
now for Grants is a closed landfill
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
grant program which uh we help to reimb
 
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
reimburse municipalities for part of the
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
cost of closure of their old Town
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
landfill facilities um most of those
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
facilities have now been closed for 20
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
30 years and so that grant program is
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
kind of winding down um but that's the
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
only grant program we have there are
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
other Grant programs through
 
00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
um third- Party U nonprofit
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
organizations like New Hampshire the
 
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
beautiful um they are an industry group
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
funded by uh the beverage industry and
 
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
and Grocers and
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
Distributors and they Target recycling
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
facilities so their their grant program
 
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
um is primarily for um you know helping
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal facilities to get a Bor or um
 
00:54:10.109 --> 00:54:10.119 align:start position:0%
you know a new container for recyclables
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
or to so they're they're very focused on
 
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
recycling um but there are other
 
00:54:16.789 --> 00:54:16.799 align:start position:0%
opportunities that maybe in the future
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
we could explore in terms of uh you know
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
developing infrastructure for composting
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
or helping to um you know get um you
 
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
know organizations off the ground that
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
do uh food rescue and help to keep food
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
uh you know from going into the into the
 
00:54:35.349 --> 00:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
waist stream that can be you know used
 
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
to feed hungry people things of that
 
00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:40.119 align:start position:0%
nature so that was a long-winded answer
 
00:54:40.119 --> 00:54:45.829 align:start position:0%
nature so that was a long-winded answer
I'm

00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
sorry uh representative Bixby for a
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
followup yes um so thank you for taking
 
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
my followup uh I I think the the thrust
 
00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:55.640 align:start position:0%
of my
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
my question I I I appreciate the
 
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
explanation of of um how
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
thees um can and can't use grants for
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities but what I was actually
 
00:55:08.829 --> 00:55:08.839 align:start position:0%
aiming at was is if there's a
 
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
possibility for Grants from say the
 
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
federal government um I if the if the
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure plan uh for instance uh
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
passes through the um Congress in
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
Washington uh then there might be an
 
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:25.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity for grant funding there
 
00:55:29.789 --> 00:55:29.799 align:start position:0%
uh that Dees could apply for and then
 
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
use that funding to um to provide more
 
00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
support for communities so I guess the
 
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
question really is uh would we be in a
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
stronger position applying for such
 
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
federal grants uh if uh we had in
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
goals that's a good question uh not
 
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:57.799 align:start position:0%
something I had that was on my radar I
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
haven't really been tracking the the
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
federal um you know the stuff going on
 
00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
with infrastructure and other other
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
initiatives happening at the federal
 
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
level um but it's it's a good idea and I
 
00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:11.630 align:start position:0%
level um but it's it's a good idea and I
think

00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
um that it doesn't hurt to have you know
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
strong goals in our statute that would
 
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:20.839 align:start position:0%
help us to kind of you know support an
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
application like like the one you just
 
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:27.630 align:start position:0%
application like like the one you just
mentioned

00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions no other hand ortion
 
00:56:35.309 --> 00:56:35.319 align:start position:0%
no other hands Mr CH yeah representative
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
Pearl thank you Mr chair I'd like to
 
00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
give a a shout out to representative
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
Murray she uh is on our Ena committee
 
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
and sat on this U Solid Waste working
 
00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
commission as well so she's been a great
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
resource for us you're all getting to
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
hear some of the things that some of
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
it's information we've heard a lot of
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
times but U I think it uh it's very
 
00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
interesting and I think your committee
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
has asked some really good questions and
 
00:57:02.829 --> 00:57:02.839 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it well thank you very much
 
00:57:05.309 --> 00:57:05.319 align:start position:0%

else Mr chair yes I have uh this is rep
 
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
Smith and I have another question from
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
Mr norc sorry I missed it the last time
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
around M Mr norc are you there still I'm
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
still I'm still here all right you may
 
00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:22.839 align:start position:0%
ask your question representative Smith
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much going back to my
 
00:58:27.789 --> 00:58:27.799 align:start position:0%
initial uh question and I wondered what
 
00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
is that is I believe referring to
 
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
um waste produced by an industrial
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturing process so the for example
 
00:58:51.029 --> 00:58:51.039 align:start position:0%
like casting sand for some facility that
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
might be uh casting metal they might
 
00:58:58.829 --> 00:58:58.839 align:start position:0%
have sand that is uh used in the casting
 
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
process that then needs to be disposed
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
of after it's been used um that's just
 
00:59:07.069 --> 00:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
one example there are probably a
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
multitude of examples that are you know
 
00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
possibly generated within the state um
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
but it would be different than waste
 
00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
produced at the same facility but in
 
00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
their cafeteria or their uh break rooms
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
or things like that which would be more
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
in line with Municipal Solid Waste kind
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
of you know just general
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
refuse does that help to to
 
00:59:36.029 --> 00:59:36.039 align:start position:0%
clarify uh a little bit I mean I have no
 
00:59:41.069 --> 00:59:41.079 align:start position:0%
idea what casting sand is but um it's a
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
start and it does help to separate it
 
00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
from like the cafeteria waste you're not
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
saying any waste from a industrial
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
facility correct okay thank
 
00:59:53.640 --> 01:00:09.589 align:start position:0%
facility correct okay thank
you

01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
go to someone else John
 
01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:23.549 align:start position:0%
go to someone else John
G

01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:34.190 align:start position:0%
 
system

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
okay good morning to the committee and
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
me uh my name's John gay I'm an engineer
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
with cellaway
 
01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
systems and um I would like to uh thank
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
the committee for uh its hard work and
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
also agree with Senator waters's earlier
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
statement that um we're going to get
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
there on this resource uh recovery and
 
01:01:10.589 --> 01:01:10.599 align:start position:0%
reduction um it's going to take some
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
hard work uh but I think we're all
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
motivated to uh make sure that this is a
 
01:01:19.029 --> 01:01:19.039 align:start position:0%
success and I think the education it was
 
01:01:20.829 --> 01:01:20.839 align:start position:0%
also mentioned is going to be a big part
 
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
of uh those accomplishments um as well
 
01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh so I'll be brief and and just want to
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
say that we absolutely support part two
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
of this bill and we fully offer our
 
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
experience and resources uh in the Wast
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
and Resource Management Field to help
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire determine how to not only
 
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
set up the appropriate goal but also to
 
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
get there and achieve it um our regional
 
01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.789 align:start position:0%
get there and achieve it um our regional
vice

01:01:47.789 --> 01:01:47.799 align:start position:0%
vice
 
01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
president uh has uh provided written
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
testimony uh that uh when you all get a
 
01:01:57.549 --> 01:01:57.559 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to take a look at it um
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's more information in there that I
 
01:02:03.309 --> 01:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
useful so we currently transport um more
 
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
than 30,000 tons of New Hampshire
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
recyclables out of state uh down to
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the cost of the
 
01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
transportation has proven to be a burden
 
01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:19.640 align:start position:0%
for some New Hampshire
 
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities and uh has resulted in in
 
01:02:25.390 --> 01:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
for some cases the abandon ment of some
 
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:27.640 align:start position:0%
of the recycling
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
programs uh so we want to try to uh
 
01:02:34.109 --> 01:02:34.119 align:start position:0%
reverse um some of that from occurring
 
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
one of the main keys to establishing and
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
achieving a waste reduction goal will be
 
01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
developing the appropriate comprehensive
 
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh in New Hampshire that
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
includes uh perhaps a new recycling
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
facility to my knowledge there's no
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
large scale recycling facility in the
 
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
state and um that is going to be
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
something that you know we want to try
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
to uh keep in Focus as we move forward
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh we commissioned uh consulting firm
 
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
DSM Environmental Services uh in Vermont
 
01:03:10.029 --> 01:03:10.039 align:start position:0%
to take a look at um uh what it might
 
01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
look like to have a a large scale
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
materials recovery
 
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
facility um in the state
 
01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
and uh we do we do feel as though it
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
will be extremely beneficial and could
 
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.990 align:start position:0%
will be extremely beneficial and could
um

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
uh amount to an annual reduction of
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions by more than
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
29,000 metric tons of carbon due to
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
increased recycling rates and of course
 
01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
decreased transportation of the
 
01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:38.839 align:start position:0%
materials that's currently going to
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts now that's the equivalent
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
of removing more than 6,000 Passenger
 
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
cars uh from New Hampshire roads each
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
year uh so you know once again I want to
 
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
encourage you to read the materials that
 
01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
Brian has offered in the written
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
testimony um and certainly support again
 
01:04:05.549 --> 01:04:05.559 align:start position:0%
once again support the bill um we uh we
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh we have a comprehensive system in New
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we would like to see that
 
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
system um become more robust and it's uh
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
it's encompassing everything that
 
01:04:22.269 --> 01:04:22.279 align:start position:0%
that that happens uh in New Hampshire
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
from the hierarchy with
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh recycling uh all the way down to
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
disposal I know there's been a lot of
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
questions about disposal uh this morning
 
01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
um we need to try to move away from that
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
and into um more reduction and and agree
 
01:04:44.109 --> 01:04:44.119 align:start position:0%
with uh Senator Waters and uh the
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
committee and their
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
work happy to take any questions that
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.269 --> 01:04:54.279 align:start position:0%
have thank you Mr is there any questions

the realities of solid waste management
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
in complying with the laws and
 
01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
regulations in New
 
01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh first off I'd like to
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
commend the work that's been done by the
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
Legislative uh Recycling and Solid Waste
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
Management study committee formed back
 
01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:41.750 align:start position:0%
Management study committee formed back
in

01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
2019 and the work they've done to
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
address the various Solid Waste issues
 
01:07:50.269 --> 01:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
faced at with folks in the state we
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
participated throughout the year-long
 
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
effort by the study committee assisted
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
with tours of the turnkey facility in
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
Rochester and our regional recycling
 
01:07:59.870 --> 01:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
plan in
 
01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
bka we're in support of a solid waste
 
01:08:04.269 --> 01:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
reduction goals being discussed here
 
01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
today and believe it will help simplify
 
01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
the tracking and efforts to reduce the
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
amount of Municipal Solid Waste being
 
01:08:14.589 --> 01:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
disposed the current law has created
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
challenges for Regulators in the
 
01:08:18.749 --> 01:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
regulated Community during the more than
 
01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
30 years it's been used to guide the
 
01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
planning of Waste Management activities
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:26.679 align:start position:0%
should also be noted that the goals that
 
01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
it set back in 1990 were never
 
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
met the legislation being proposed today
 
01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
Target solid was streams that can be
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
recycled or reduced PRI to disposal it
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
also excludes those materials that are
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
not readily recycled such as residuals
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
coming from recycling
 
01:08:44.279 --> 01:08:46.030 align:start position:0%
coming from recycling
operations

01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
operations
 
01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
asbest contaminated soils
 
01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
sludges incinerator Ash Etc and it sets
 
01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
a clear goal for reducing the total
 
01:08:58.030 --> 01:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
amount of solid waste disposed in
 
01:08:59.470 --> 01:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
landfills and
 
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
incinerators it'll also avoid confusion
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
in the current law as you heard Michael
 
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
knor from Dees speak to on how to
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
measure and track waste diversion and
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
instead sets an overall limit on the
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
disposal of Municipal Solid Waste in
 
01:09:19.709 --> 01:09:19.719 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris we
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
believe the change is important and will
 
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
lead to reducing the amount of Municipal
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
solid wasting construction debrises
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
disposed in the state at this time i''d
 
01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions that
 
01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
the committee may
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
have all right thank you Mr POI is there
 
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
D see none I don't see any question okay
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:56.189 --> 01:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
resources I do have one question uh yes
 
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
Mr Po thank you for your testimony the
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
one thing you said that that struck me
 
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
is that the goals set in 1990 were never
 
01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
achieved um do you know why they were
 
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
not achieved and why was this why will
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
this bill be different and why would we
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
achieve the goals with this
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
bill okay I I can address that thank you
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
for your question um the reason why the
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
goals in 1990 were not achieved is I
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
think uh and you heard the dees
 
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative speak to this it was a
 
01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
difficulty in
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
tracking the numbers that go into the
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
calculation to determine what is
 
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
diversion and there's still ongoing
 
01:10:37.709 --> 01:10:37.719 align:start position:0%
discussions and debate on those types of
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
materials that should be considered in
 
01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
establishing a diversion rate in the
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh the state of
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has certain criteria for
 
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
defining what solid waste is and the EPA
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
has a different definition so there's a
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
lot of conf confusion and disagreement
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
on that the new bill going forward sets
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
a pretty simplistic number they
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
basically have identified a target of
 
01:11:06.189 --> 01:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
what was disposed in the incinerators
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
and the landfills in the state of New
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
2018 and is basically
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
said in you know 2030 and 2050 that's
 
01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
going to be reduced by 25% and
 
01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
45% that will be very easy for the dees
 
01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
thank you sir that's your
 
01:11:30.669 --> 01:11:30.679 align:start position:0%
question any other
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
questions if not thank you very much for
 
01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:33.990 align:start position:0%
questions if not thank you very much for
your

01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.470 align:start position:0%
your
testimony

01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
you any is ready I do not
 
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
see okay uh one of the problems with uh
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
remote testimony and the system we have
 
01:11:58.030 --> 01:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
01:12:03.629 --> 01:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
allow for showing up whether well what
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh what parts of an Omnibus Bill someone
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on it's I've been
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
lucky as I did do have the uh written
 
01:12:18.669 --> 01:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
testimony of most of the people who have
 
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
uh spoken and uh and I just was a I was
 
01:12:26.189 --> 01:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
able to track that but there are several
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
other some others who uh wish who say
 
01:12:32.669 --> 01:12:32.679 align:start position:0%
they wish to speak but they may be on
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
other portions of the bill I presume uh
 
01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
Ted deers is wish from Dees who wants to
 
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
speak on something other than than
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%

great pleasure to be before you today
 
01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
with uh this part two of Senate Bill
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
146 um this bill uh came out uh you have
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
testimony I believe you all have
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
testimony from us it was sent out uh I
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
think yesterday or the day before um I
 
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
won't read the testimony I'll just note
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
a couple of items about sort of where
 
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
this came from and where this is headed
 
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
um the coastal program has been around
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
for quite a while uh I was the former uh
 
01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
director of the coastal program uh and I
 
01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
knew many of you from from that role the
 
01:14:32.189 --> 01:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
the impetus for this particular Bill
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
really comes out of a couple things one
 
01:14:37.229 --> 01:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
is the re is the relatively recent uh
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
changes to the SEC process the uh that
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
is the sighting evaluation committee uh
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
as we were looking through that it
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
became clear that the linkages uh
 
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
between how Federal consistency review
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
and I'll talk about that in one second
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
how Federal consistency review and the
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
way that uh the SEC uh law was set up we
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
needed to make some changes to our
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
program to accommodate those changes and
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
as we started going through that it
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
became clear and clearer that one of the
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
challenges that we face is making sure
 
01:15:14.189 --> 01:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
that the actual program itself which is
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
which administers funds from the from
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
the uh National Oceanic and Atmospheric
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
Administration under the um uh authority
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
of the coastal zone management Act
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
that that had
 
01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
a are you are you talking on speaking on
 
01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
part one or part two sorry part one oh
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
okay yeah that's I figured uh yeah the
 
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
that's we're gonna be do doing that very
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
shortly okay yeah I
 
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
rewind uh yeah rewind yeah I I apologize
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
the reason I uh because it didn't
 
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
because I did see Mr nor uh and you both
 
01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
from the dees I didn't know if you were
 
01:15:59.629 --> 01:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
both testifying on part two want to just
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
let me just wrap up part two it should
 
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
take only a few seconds um this uh we do
 
01:16:10.629 --> 01:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
have on the list uh Senator
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
Sherman uh is he's there at all uh I did
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
not see okay and uh I do not see anyone
 
01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
else on the list who wishes to
 
01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
speak uh no hands are raised and no
 
01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
hands are raised okay uh unfortunately I
 
01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
can't read who might be uh in favor or
 
01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
against uh this bill and do not wish to
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
speak because of this the because of the
 
01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
because of the issues with the system
 
01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
itself the shortcomings of the of the
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
system to handle Omnibus bills that
 
01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
being the case I think we have had all
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
the testimony on part part one uh
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%

01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:47.719 align:start position:0%
are strictly the purview of the uh
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%

committee and that is part part one
 
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
which is the establishing a coastal
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
program administered by the Department
 
01:25:58.510 --> 01:25:58.520 align:start position:0%

01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
is a vehicle uh to receive funding from
 
01:27:01.629 --> 01:27:01.639 align:start position:0%
Noah and then to really help out our
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities and our agencies when
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
they're planning for um resources
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
Recreation and to me most importantly
 
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
Economic Development to on our on our
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
Coastal uh areas and um we need to play
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
place this in state statute for a couple
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
reasons which I'm sure Ted deers will um
 
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
go go into too if it's in State Statute
 
01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
it not only helps us with Federal
 
01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
consistency meaning that we can take
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
whatever Federal Regulations about
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
coastal zone or coming coming through
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
and help our uh municipalities uh deal
 
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
with them um but also it means in if
 
01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
it's in State Statute that the program
 
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
can much better serve state agencies and
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
our local municipalities uh in these
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
these ways I'll get into the details of
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
the program in a in just a moment but I
 
01:27:55.229 --> 01:27:55.239 align:start position:0%
want to also act another important thing
 
01:27:58.590 --> 01:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
that this um section does is that it
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
establishes a um a a fund uh that can
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
then receive those Grant funds and
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps other funding as well that might
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
become available and make sure that that
 
01:28:12.270 --> 01:28:12.280 align:start position:0%
those funds are spent the right way and
 
01:28:14.109 --> 01:28:14.119 align:start position:0%
spent the way that um you know that we
 
01:28:16.669 --> 01:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
have some ways to supervise that in the
 
01:28:18.910 --> 01:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
in the legislature there's Ru making
 
01:28:20.430 --> 01:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
around that as well and I think that's
 
01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
good for transparency but I also think
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
it really will help um provide an
 
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to get more funding
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
from the federal government and other
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
sources here and to that point um
 
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
there's no FN attached here we're not
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
talking about um expenditure of
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
additional State funds with this it's
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
just getting the program and statute and
 
01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
also I I I think I want to note because
 
01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
it came up a lot in the Senate hearings
 
01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
um that this program in and of itself
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
has no regulatory Authority it it's
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
really meant to help municipalities and
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
agencies deal with regulations that that
 
01:28:54.669 --> 01:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
are coming down in the coastal zone um f
 
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
from federal um acts and other other
 
01:29:01.629 --> 01:29:01.639 align:start position:0%
ways as well so um just to look briefly
 
01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
at at it it uh more or less the language
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
here describes what the program um is
 
01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
doing um we have just incredible
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
environment along our our Coast great
 
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
natural resources which um are important
 
01:29:18.109 --> 01:29:18.119 align:start position:0%
to preserve for the health of the
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
waterways but also for the health of the
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
people I work doing on Great Bay and on
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
on the coast um and then it's these
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
resources are important uh not just
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
because of you know the beauty of them
 
01:29:33.310 --> 01:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
but also because this is what Recreation
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
is all about on our Coastal area and
 
01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
also what great assets for economic
 
01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
development as
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
well um so you can see here under the
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
establishment of the program um it
 
01:29:49.870 --> 01:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
purpose is to do uh just that and you
 
01:29:52.109 --> 01:29:52.119 align:start position:0%
have those listed in numbers uh one one
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
and two on page uh two and um the uh
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
particular aspects of the the um you
 
01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
know flood prone zones the coastal zones
 
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
storm surge and all and this becomes
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
awfully important in the ways in which
 
01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
the coastal program helps welome
 
01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities I mean for example if
 
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
they want to plan for um a waste waste
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
management water a water plant um just
 
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:19.400 align:start position:0%
how are they going to build that and
 
01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:21.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's going to be able to
 
01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:22.669 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's going to be able to
operate

01:30:22.669 --> 01:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
operate
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
um safely and be protected and resilient
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh on the coastal um Coastal conditions
 
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
also um lots of good programs uh too
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
they they provide grants and other
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
programs to help municipalities deal
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
with Coastal erosion Shoreland shoreline
 
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
erosion and those things as as as well
 
01:30:44.669 --> 01:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
um and then uh if you go a little bit
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
further down um the management here uh
 
01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
and what it's supposed to do starting on
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
line 18
 
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
um you know here's you know clearly the
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
the heart of it for me is the
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
recreational opportunities and economic
 
01:31:01.629 --> 01:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
um development uh to make sure our
 
01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
communities can continue um to to
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
thrive another function here too is the
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
comprehensive planning function um you
 
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
know we have a lot of of planning that
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
has to be done um along our coastal zone
 
01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
and uh we have some acts that govern
 
01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
that and of course the Rockingham
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
Commission straford uh County Commission
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
also helps out with planning as well but
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of municipalities really need need
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
help in their their planning uh looking
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
not just for you know Wastewater or
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
other kinds of economic development but
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
also for coming Coastal conditions in
 
01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
terms of storm surge and flooding and
 
01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
other things as well so this this
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
program really steps in and helps out
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
with the planning um for municip
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities and then finally just on
 
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
page three uh there's the fund that I
 
01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned um establishes a a fund
 
01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated to this and um the monies that
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
can come in and then the rules to make
 
01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
sure that the money is distributed in a
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
transparent and uh in ways that um
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
fulfill the uh purpose of the of the
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
funds and give give the state uh
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate oversight of that as well so
 
01:32:13.950 --> 01:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman um there it is and uh you
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
know Ted deers is here but I'm happy to
 
01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
take any
 
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for from members
 
01:32:25.229 --> 01:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
I did have one question representative
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
kraton Senator again thank you so much
 
01:32:35.109 --> 01:32:35.119 align:start position:0%
in the goals established um on first on
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
the second page are excellent goals um
 
01:32:40.990 --> 01:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm confused on where the money
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
comes from if you establish a fund but
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
that doesn't come out of state funds
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
where does that money come from well
 
01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:51.400 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question and um you know
 
01:32:53.070 --> 01:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
Ted can give more detail on that but the
 
01:32:55.229 --> 01:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
major funding for the coastal program
 
01:32:56.910 --> 01:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
and the coastal management act comes
 
01:32:59.310 --> 01:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
from Noah and they they provide grants
 
01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:01.719 align:start position:0%
to the states that have the coastal
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
programs and that's that's that's the
 
01:33:06.030 --> 01:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
major source of funding here um so when
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
those funds come in now we'll have a
 
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
place to this dedicated place to put
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
them and also has the transparency and
 
01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
uh rules around it that you know I think
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
are really we always want in the
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
legislature to see
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
sir any other questions for the senator
 
01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
there no other hands
 
01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
raised there all right seeing no other
 
01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
hand raised thank you very much Senator
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
deers thank you very much uh can you uh
 
01:33:43.109 --> 01:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
hear me okay uh yep here you're fine
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I uh apologize for uh
 
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
jumping in ahead of the uhe of the the
 
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:51.800 align:start position:0%
gun there um so uh uh I you know know I
 
01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
was very just very excited to to enter
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
into this conversation
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to repeat uh much of
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
what I said except that uh just to note
 
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
a couple of things um this idea uh of
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
funding that uh not only does the the
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
coastal program received kind of an
 
01:34:11.709 --> 01:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
annual allocation from Noah but the
 
01:34:13.390 --> 01:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
program has been extraordinarily
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
successful over the years at bringing in
 
01:34:18.669 --> 01:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
other grants and that's one of the
 
01:34:21.149 --> 01:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
important pieces here almost every
 
01:34:21.159 --> 01:34:22.310 align:start position:0%
important pieces here almost every
dollar

01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh that comes in outside of the the just
 
01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
the the the basic amount to support
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
staff and offices and all that kind of
 
01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
stuff is passed through to the
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities I think this was
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned by the senator um over the
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
past years we have literally passed
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
through millions of dollars to the
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities for long range planning
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
for projects for restoration projects um
 
01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
and so that that has been very helpful
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
to the communities and to the ecosystem
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
salt marsh restoration you know lots of
 
01:34:55.229 --> 01:34:55.239 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things which have
 
01:34:58.629 --> 01:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
happened over the years um I would also
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
note that if you've seen some of the
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
what's coming out of the current
 
01:35:04.109 --> 01:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
Administration and even the last
 
01:35:06.510 --> 01:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
Administration um there's a real focus
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
on Coastal hazards and you know I think
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
that the PE people along the coast
 
01:35:13.709 --> 01:35:13.719 align:start position:0%
understand that they're seeing more
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
stronger storms they're seeing more uh
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
what we call you know uh Sunshine
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
flooding uh which is what happens to in
 
01:35:23.550 --> 01:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
extremely high tides and those tides are
 
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
getting higher over over time and so
 
01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
this idea of of really trying to bring
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
in resources to help the communities
 
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
with those is important in fact uh if
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
you saw the article yesterday from um
 
01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
maybe it was in today in the paper
 
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
relative to some of the uh the meetings
 
01:35:41.709 --> 01:35:41.719 align:start position:0%
that were happening with the new uh
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
Secretary of Commerce um out in the Sea
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
Coast uh former Senator Styles uh Nancy
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
Styles who's been a strong advocate for
 
01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
our Co Coastal communities for many many
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
decades um you know she was talking
 
01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
about this need for additional funding
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
to support the long-term planning and
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
and really trying to figure out what
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to do to make sure that
 
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
those uh communities and economies along
 
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
Route 1A uh are going to be supported
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
over the long term and so that's I think
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
really important the other piece that
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll mention and I can't believe
 
01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
Senator uh Waters didn't talk about this
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
was the ongoing discussions of offshore
 
01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
wind energy um
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
he chairs a committee in fact we had a
 
01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
meeting yesterday and one of the
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
important things that just came out
 
01:36:28.750 --> 01:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday in the meeting was the
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
concerns of our fishermen uh about the
 
01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:34.679 align:start position:0%
placement of a future placement if we
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
ever do get it of offshore wind uh that
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
would bring electricity into our our
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
grid here in in the
 
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
Northeast one of the things that Federal
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
consistency does and this is it's a very
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
Arcane little piece of of legislation um
 
01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
is it requires any federal activity to
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
be consistent with state laws and that
 
01:36:58.830 --> 01:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
is super important it's one of the few
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
places where the states have this kind
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
of uh Sovereign right to be able to
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
address what's going on and being
 
01:37:11.310 --> 01:37:11.320 align:start position:0%
permitted by the fed by by the feds and
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
so this is really important you know
 
01:37:15.149 --> 01:37:15.159 align:start position:0%
relative to some of those concerns by
 
01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
the Fisheries to make sure that we have
 
01:37:20.830 --> 01:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
tools back to our state laws and our
 
01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:23.159 align:start position:0%
state policies the policies that you all
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
create to make sure that as that
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
important industry grows that we take
 
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
into account very strongly those
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
concerns of our fishermen so and and and
 
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
and other kinds of stakeholders as well
 
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
so I just want to note that there's some
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
really important aspects to this not
 
01:37:41.870 --> 01:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
just for where we've been but I think
 
01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
that where we're going as well and I
 
01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
want to Echo Senator uh Waters uh
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
comments about that that the fact of
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
having this in statute is important uh
 
01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
probably more more important now than
 
01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
ever and to thank you and to thank the
 
01:37:55.790 --> 01:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
senator very much for introducing this
 
01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and I'll stop there
 
01:37:59.350 --> 01:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
and just see if people have questions
 
01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:06.910 --> 01:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
complicated any questions for Mr dear
 
01:38:09.870 --> 01:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
sir I see no questions no questions at
 
01:38:13.629 --> 01:38:13.639 align:start position:0%
the moment I I do have a question or two
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh Mr deers uh I'm kind of a you know I
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
need I view things in pictures I guess
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why I like kind of
 
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
flowcharts uh you have with this looks
 
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
like there's Federal money that's coming
 
01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
in somewhere to the state and somehow
 
01:38:38.430 --> 01:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
getting through to the towns yes uh
 
01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
and what does it look like now as
 
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to what it will look like what
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
will the picture look like once this uh
 
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
uh Coastal program is established in
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
state statute
 
01:38:53.790 --> 01:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question this is I
 
01:38:54.910 --> 01:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
think probably one of the the
 
01:38:57.629 --> 01:38:57.639 align:start position:0%
challenging Parts uh to understand the
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
fact of the matter is is that we do have
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
a mechanism uh currently to bring in the
 
01:39:04.149 --> 01:39:04.159 align:start position:0%
general you know not the general funds
 
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
the federal funds that are generally uh
 
01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:09.320 align:start position:0%
allocated to the state we have a
 
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism to bring those in as we do
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
other grants from EPA and other things
 
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
like that the the fund that we're really
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
looking at here is is a much more
 
01:39:19.390 --> 01:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
flexible kind of fund that would allow
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
for other kinds of Grant
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know potentially from
 
01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
foundations uh you know other kinds of
 
01:39:28.830 --> 01:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
activities that could go on in which
 
01:39:32.669 --> 01:39:32.679 align:start position:0%
this fund could serve as a a place to to
 
01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
put some of this so for example if a
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
couple of communities wanted to join
 
01:39:39.589 --> 01:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
together in a project that becomes very
 
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
challenging for two communities to
 
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
figure out how they deal with the
 
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
physical nature of of giving money to
 
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
each other um whereas having kind of a
 
01:39:52.030 --> 01:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
having a fund like this and onlaps fund
 
01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
would allow us to be able to have that
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
kind of mechanism to allow for
 
01:39:58.830 --> 01:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
communities to enter into those kinds of
 
01:40:01.950 --> 01:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
projects seek out grants uh whether it's
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
private or or government funding and be
 
01:40:06.990 --> 01:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
able to implement the kinds of projects
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
that they'd like to do so that's I think
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
the kind of opportunity this that this
 
01:40:15.589 --> 01:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
creates it's a more flexible uh approach
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
than we've we've had in the
 
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
past for a followup uh will the Noah
 
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
funding go into this fund or Noah money
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
go into this fund or will it be other
 
01:40:32.109 --> 01:40:32.119 align:start position:0%
funding or both thank you for the
 
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
question I'm not entirely sure yet I
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
think this is one of the things that we
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
would have to right now because we
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
already have the Noah funding uh in the
 
01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
proposed budget for the
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
2223 budget I think it would certainly
 
01:40:45.589 --> 01:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
go there this would be an interesting
 
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
conversation to have when we start to
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
generate the uh 20 uh 24 five budget um
 
01:40:54.830 --> 01:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
which scarily enough will happen in just
 
01:40:58.350 --> 01:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
about a year uh so um anyway that that's
 
01:40:59.669 --> 01:40:59.679 align:start position:0%
that's the discussion that we'll have
 
01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
budget okay all right the any additional
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
any questions for anyone else from the
 
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh from the committee no further
 
01:41:15.390 --> 01:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
questions no further
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
questions I thought there'd be a lot
 
01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:19.550 align:start position:0%
questions I thought there'd be a lot
more

01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
questions uh
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further questions is
 
01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.270 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further questions is
uh

01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
should that's it all right that I guess
 
01:41:37.589 --> 01:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
that's it on part one of uh of the of
 
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
the of the bill
 
01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
um next part of the uh bill is uh item
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
four on tital
 
01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.550 align:start position:0%
four on tital
Waters

01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
Waters
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters to talk on title
 
01:41:58.270 --> 01:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
Waters thank you Mr chairman that's
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
right I'm I'm up to my neck and Waters I
 
01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
guess this today with you all um still
 
01:42:06.629 --> 01:42:06.639 align:start position:0%
Senator David Waters District 4 I'm here
 
01:42:09.390 --> 01:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
to introduced uh part four of Senate
 
01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
Bill uh
 
01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:15.639 align:start position:0%
146 um this uh Bill the simple seemingly
 
01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
simple change here is somewhat technical
 
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
but awfully important for New Hampshire
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
as it gives us some standards uh in
 
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
state statute for uh determining um
 
01:42:32.189 --> 01:42:32.199 align:start position:0%
levels of um these uh these chemicals
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
feto C form and others in our our Waters
 
01:42:37.870 --> 01:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit of the background of this
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
um this came uh to me from the state
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
Association of Municipal Water
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
managers and um they need it for a
 
01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh one in the coastal area and
 
01:42:55.390 --> 01:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
particularly the communities around
 
01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:56.430 align:start position:0%
particularly the communities around
Great

01:42:56.430 --> 01:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
Great
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
Bay that there recently has been a
 
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
consent agreement signed with the EPA
 
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
about how to measure uh nitrogen in the
 
01:43:09.589 --> 01:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
Great Bay Waters coming out of waste
 
01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
water treatment plants and also from
 
01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:13.910 align:start position:0%
water treatment plants and also from
other

01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
sources that you know there are lawsuits
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
there were there just activity for many
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
many years to get to the place where um
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
the municipalities under this new
 
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
agreement are giving some Authority uh
 
01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
to try to reduce the nitrogen from lots
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
of different sources not just the
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment and why that's
 
01:43:35.709 --> 01:43:35.719 align:start position:0%
important is we're about to get hammered
 
01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
with another 100 million dollars that
 
01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
we'd have to spend to upgrade water
 
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
treatment plants which had some of them
 
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
just been constructed or just been
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
upgraded at the cost of 20 to $30
 
01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
million to meet certain standards so the
 
01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
argument the communities made was look
 
01:43:52.350 --> 01:43:52.360 align:start position:0%
give us more
 
01:43:54.629 --> 01:43:54.639 align:start position:0%
flexibility and we will be able to get
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
this this done and one of the important
 
01:43:59.070 --> 01:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
things here was to be able to have in
 
01:44:01.629 --> 01:44:01.639 align:start position:0%
State Statute the measure we were going
 
01:44:06.310 --> 01:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
to use for mollusks for
 
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
aquaculture um because that was one of
 
01:44:12.109 --> 01:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
the standards of Cl of cleanliness that
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
was being used um at the national level
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
and uh we did not feel that the
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
standards from the national folks were
 
01:44:21.629 --> 01:44:21.639 align:start position:0%
really appropriate for the our our
 
01:44:24.510 --> 01:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
Waters and by having this then it gives
 
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
us um an opportunity to negotiate and to
 
01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
say this is a better this is better
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
reflects the cleanness of the water uh
 
01:44:35.589 --> 01:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
here and then secondly um a lot wider
 
01:44:37.510 --> 01:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
range of communities are now being
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
affected by the ms4
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
regulations and uh here too uh having a
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
stat um standard and statute will help
 
01:44:51.149 --> 01:44:51.159 align:start position:0%
us uh in in negotiating
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
um over what the implications of of ms4
 
01:44:56.750 --> 01:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
are going to be for the communities that
 
01:45:01.149 --> 01:45:01.159 align:start position:0%
are affected um by it so um with that
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
said and I think we'll have some other
 
01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
testimony some of the technical uh
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
details here um but what it does is
 
01:45:09.550 --> 01:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
updates the reference to the um Federal
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh program there and what's important is
 
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
that it breaks out here it says here's
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
the standard that we think is right for
 
01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
the state and then the analytical
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
methods and sampling you yes we will
 
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
follow um uh those by developed here by
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
01:45:31.149 --> 01:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
that's really important um approved the
 
01:45:32.350 --> 01:45:32.360 align:start position:0%
the kind of methods that are then
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
approved in the latest revision of the
 
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
national shellfish sanitation program so
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
what it really does it gives it gives
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
the state the power it needs and the
 
01:45:42.990 --> 01:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
standards it needs to clean up the water
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
but not not be under the not be um you
 
01:45:47.229 --> 01:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
know under the demands and perhaps
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
inappropriate standards sometimes of the
 
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh of the EPA on this so um that that's
 
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
it Mr chairman and um have you got to
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
take any questions and I I do think
 
01:45:59.390 --> 01:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
you'll probably have some folks from the
 
01:46:01.589 --> 01:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh Water Association who can talk to it
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
as well if not and Ted deer let me just
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
add to is that um this has been vetted
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
by the folks in Fisheries um by Sheree
 
01:46:11.950 --> 01:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
Patterson in fishing game and by Steve
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
coocher in Dees and and uh they thought
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is Thoroughly appropriate for the
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
protections we want to have for our
 
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
agriculture um industry and Hampshire
 
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
and thank
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
you is there any uh questions for
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I see no
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
okay coming off mute okay all right M Mr
 
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:51.719 align:start position:0%
deers I do have something from Dees even
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
though it the the boss always signs his
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
name he does mention you so he's taking
 
01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
my name in vain once again thank you uh
 
01:47:04.189 --> 01:47:04.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:47:06.589 --> 01:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
committee I am still Ted deers uh from
 
01:47:08.830 --> 01:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
01:47:10.830 --> 01:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
and um if you thought that the coastal
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
zone management Act was uh was Arcane uh
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
wait till you see this bill um this is
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
where the Clean Water Act intersects
 
01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
with the national shellfish sanitation
 
01:47:24.669 --> 01:47:24.679 align:start position:0%
program and uh that's where it gets fun
 
01:47:27.950 --> 01:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
so um really quickly uh what this bill
 
01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
and and Senator Waters did a fantastic
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
job of trying to lay this out for you um
 
01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
essentially what this does is currently
 
01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
it it's it solves a problem in in
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
sampling methods that we have currently
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh we have a method for for for sampling
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
Waters that everyone is using in the Sea
 
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
Coast um and it's a great method it is a
 
01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
way that you can actually uh gather the
 
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
water and you incubate it right there in
 
01:47:54.589 --> 01:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
at the wastewater treatment plant it's
 
01:47:57.790 --> 01:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
so simple that even I could do it um so
 
01:48:00.589 --> 01:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
it is it is really a slick method and
 
01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
what the problem that we came across is
 
01:48:05.310 --> 01:48:05.320 align:start position:0%
that a strict reading of the regulations
 
01:48:07.390 --> 01:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
that we had and the strict read reading
 
01:48:09.470 --> 01:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
of the regulations as EPA was reading
 
01:48:12.589 --> 01:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
them would dictate that we could not use
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
that kind of methodology we had to use
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
an older more Antiquated technology that
 
01:48:22.030 --> 01:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
required significant expense on account
 
01:48:23.629 --> 01:48:23.639 align:start position:0%
of the wastewater treatment plants in
 
01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
order to uh comply with it and not only
 
01:48:30.709 --> 01:48:30.719 align:start position:0%
that it was a slower method to actually
 
01:48:34.109 --> 01:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
yield results so so we had this
 
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
conundrum and so what we've done is this
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation mimics the way
 
01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
other states have avoided this issue um
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
it does link up both the Clean Water Act
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
regulations that EPA is looking at when
 
01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
they're writing permits as well as the
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
shellfish sanitation program regulations
 
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at when we're making
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
sure that it's safe for you to go eat
 
01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
those oysters and clams and muscles um
 
01:49:03.910 --> 01:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
which are amongst my favorite of foods
 
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
um and so what it does is it allows for
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
that to happen it will once this goes
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
into place it will save the wastewater
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
treatment plants money and yield a
 
01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:17.639 align:start position:0%
better ability for us to regulate the
 
01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
shellfish program so that if there ever
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
is a problem we can immediately respond
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
and make sure that no consumers are
 
01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
getting uh you know fouled uh shellfish
 
01:49:30.350 --> 01:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a really important little
 
01:49:32.030 --> 01:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
tiny piece of legislation that is
 
01:49:33.629 --> 01:49:33.639 align:start position:0%
incredibly I know it's technically
 
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
challenging uh to look at and to
 
01:49:37.470 --> 01:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
understand I hope that the letter that
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
we produced helps um and if you have any
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
questions at all I'm happy to answer
 
01:49:43.669 --> 01:49:43.679 align:start position:0%
them and I believe that there may be
 
01:49:47.229 --> 01:49:47.239 align:start position:0%
others uh from the industry who are also
 
01:49:49.709 --> 01:49:49.719 align:start position:0%
available um to be able to answer their
 
01:49:51.589 --> 01:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
questions from their perspective so with
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
that I will open it up to any questions
 
01:49:55.310 --> 01:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
that the committee might
 
01:49:58.149 --> 01:49:58.159 align:start position:0%
have questions from members of the
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
committee sir I see no question from
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
okay there's uh no me no no questions uh
 
01:50:08.430 --> 01:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
there is no one
 
01:50:14.430 --> 01:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
else signed up to speak and other than
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh Paul Sanderson from fish and game
 
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
and I believe he's speaking uh
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh on items three and I guess three and
 
01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
five the part that fishing game will be
 
01:50:31.149 --> 01:50:31.159 align:start position:0%
part of uh is there anyone from the
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
audience who want wishes to speak to
 
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
this or to
 
01:50:42.109 --> 01:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh item or or do item item one part one
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
anyone from the audience
 
01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:46.109 align:start position:0%
anyone from the audience
no

01:50:46.109 --> 01:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh I see seeing nothing I will'll
 
01:50:54.669 --> 01:50:54.679 align:start position:0%
go on from believe part four and we will
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
is go here's the bill part six which is
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
public use of coastal
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
shorelands and and Senator
 
01:51:21.270 --> 01:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
Waters thank you Mr chairman if if
 
01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
Senator Sherman is is not here I'm happy
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
to introduce this part
 
01:51:29.229 --> 01:51:29.239 align:start position:0%
okay um so again thank you uh me Mr
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee Senator
 
01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
Waters District uh four um this is
 
01:51:37.629 --> 01:51:37.639 align:start position:0%
really kind of a housekeeping bill um we
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
have changed a number of years ago the
 
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
definition of the high water uh
 
01:51:48.510 --> 01:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
Mark uh and this was just one section of
 
01:51:51.069 --> 01:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
law that it came to Senator Sherman's
 
01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
attention that that change had not been
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
made so basically it's bringing this
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
section of law uh into Conformity with
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
the other parts of the law where the um
 
01:52:04.750 --> 01:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
definition now is the average height of
 
01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
all the high waters over a complete
 
01:52:09.069 --> 01:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
title cycle commonly referred to as the
 
01:52:10.910 --> 01:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
mean high tide
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
line so um that that's that's it really
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
is kind of a housekeeping but that's
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
does any any questions of Senator
 
01:52:25.470 --> 01:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
Waters should we have one question stand
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
by it's uh represent span uh
 
01:52:28.639 --> 01:52:31.229 align:start position:0%
by it's uh represent span uh
representative

01:52:31.229 --> 01:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:34.669 --> 01:52:34.679 align:start position:0%
Spain thank you Senator Waters I was
 
01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
curious about this one as soon as I saw
 
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
it and I have been um involved in this
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
kind of uh issue before it seems to me
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
that what we're doing is that we
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
are uh reducing the amount amount of um
 
01:52:54.629 --> 01:52:54.639 align:start position:0%
of land that is going to be protected
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
instead of it being uh the highest water
 
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
that is seen say in storms or or the
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
high even the high uh Waters that we see
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
in the the spring and fall uh lunar
 
01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
things uh high
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
waters all of that area will no longer
 
01:53:18.589 --> 01:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
be protected now we're just going down
 
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
to the average
 
01:53:23.790 --> 01:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
of the high the High Tides um is that
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
true that we are leaving some of that
 
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
area now
 
01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
unprotected well thanks for your
 
01:53:32.589 --> 01:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
question uh representative and I I I
 
01:53:36.990 --> 01:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
think not really um because if you look
 
01:53:38.430 --> 01:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
at this we've got the
 
01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
19-year matonic ti title cycle right and
 
01:53:47.310 --> 01:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
um you know that comes and goes and uh
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
so are you g to catch one you know
 
01:53:55.470 --> 01:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
extreme high tide and have that be set
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
the standard but the difference between
 
01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
that and the average height of all the
 
01:54:02.310 --> 01:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
high waters over a complete title cycle
 
01:54:04.669 --> 01:54:04.679 align:start position:0%
is really what's more meaningful here
 
01:54:06.669 --> 01:54:06.679 align:start position:0%
and I will say that you know if you want
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
to get into the Arcana of this um this
 
01:54:11.310 --> 01:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
goes back to English common law which
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
was adopted um in in our
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
Colony um to try to you know to to
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
negotiate in between the um you know
 
01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:23.800 align:start position:0%
what what is the public uh property and
 
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
what is the private uh property and um
 
01:54:28.709 --> 01:54:28.719 align:start position:0%
you know there are centuries of of work
 
01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
on this um but this one I think is real
 
01:54:35.229 --> 01:54:35.239 align:start position:0%
common sense it also as I said reflects
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
what is elsewhere in statute so I I
 
01:54:40.270 --> 01:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
don't think that we are really um in any
 
01:54:42.910 --> 01:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
in any way any meaningful way um
 
01:54:46.149 --> 01:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
changing the amount of of uh land that
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
is uh covered by this follow up Mr Mr
 
01:54:54.109 --> 01:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
chairman or followup yes thank you for
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
taking my questions Senator um at one
 
01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
time wasn't the definition of and and of
 
01:55:04.990 --> 01:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
course we're talking about now where the
 
01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
buffer is going to start when we're
 
01:55:10.990 --> 01:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
talking about buffers from from the um
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
Sal salt water um so it is significant
 
01:55:18.229 --> 01:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
and wasn't it before the
 
01:55:21.669 --> 01:55:21.679 align:start position:0%
highest um the highest Waters the
 
01:55:24.510 --> 01:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
highest high tides that was
 
01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:28.639 align:start position:0%
the the limit now that highest high tide
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
is getting absorbed in a in an average
 
01:55:35.950 --> 01:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
that may not respect the amount of high
 
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
waters there are say there are three or
 
01:55:42.189 --> 01:55:42.199 align:start position:0%
four very high water events
 
01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
um that and they're going to get
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
completely U subsumes by an average so
 
01:55:51.709 --> 01:55:51.719 align:start position:0%
we're losing the protection of those
 
01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
highest high
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
waters uh particularly if there aren't
 
01:55:57.950 --> 01:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
so many of them that they're beginning
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
average thank you um representative for
 
01:56:06.589 --> 01:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
the question there and
 
01:56:09.790 --> 01:56:09.800 align:start position:0%
um you know I I I again I'm not sure
 
01:56:12.589 --> 01:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
that it makes much difference in terms
 
01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
of practical effect in terms of where
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
the line is I do think that this
 
01:56:22.109 --> 01:56:22.119 align:start position:0%
standard reflects the reality of the
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
19-year cycle and as it may over time
 
01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
shift um you know and I I just not to
 
01:56:32.189 --> 01:56:32.199 align:start position:0%
get into it too much but you know we are
 
01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
there's the other thing is the U the the
 
01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:37.960 align:start position:0%
Atlantic overturning Mariton
 
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
overturning uh which affects the speed
 
01:56:42.910 --> 01:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
of the Gulf Stream and the welling up of
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
waters and the central Atlantic I mean
 
01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
those things change over a long cycle as
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
well and um so there's a lot going on
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
out out there in the ocean but this to
 
01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
me is is fairness and it's about
 
01:56:59.709 --> 01:56:59.719 align:start position:0%
consistency I think it balances off the
 
01:57:01.550 --> 01:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
private property owners rights with the
 
01:57:04.069 --> 01:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
public interest appropriately and I also
 
01:57:05.950 --> 01:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
think this is a you know more
 
01:57:08.990 --> 01:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
meaningfully measurable standard to to
 
01:57:11.109 --> 01:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
use and that's why it's been adopted
 
01:57:14.830 --> 01:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
elsewhere great and one more Mr chairman
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
so the um and I for a followup for a
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
followup um I think in our in our
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
documentation of the bill you also cite
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
the fact that the data to support that
 
01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
establishment of that line is readily
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
available and I think when you say that
 
01:57:36.189 --> 01:57:36.199 align:start position:0%
this is going to be much easier to
 
01:57:38.109 --> 01:57:38.119 align:start position:0%
implement I
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
agree um one the 19 year kind of bothers
 
01:57:46.189 --> 01:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
me um I think you of all people know
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
about sea level rise and I'm wondering
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
if our sea level rise um is going to be
 
01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
captured in 19 years or may we be having
 
01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
changes that are more more gradual that
 
01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately will call for higher high
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
high tide line in less than 19
 
01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
years well thanks thanks for the
 
01:58:13.149 --> 01:58:13.159 align:start position:0%
question and um we're getting a we're
 
01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:15.090 align:start position:0%
getting into deep Waters
 
01:58:15.090 --> 01:58:16.510 align:start position:0%
getting into deep Waters
[Music]

01:58:16.510 --> 01:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:58:18.589 --> 01:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
representative um but let me let me just
 
01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
say to to back up a little bit and say
 
01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:23.639 align:start position:0%
you know um you know surely uh we're
 
01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
projecting and we're seeing you know
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
some sea level rise um we're see that
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's been documented about 8
 
01:58:32.189 --> 01:58:32.199 align:start position:0%
inches over the last century and there's
 
01:58:34.709 --> 01:58:34.719 align:start position:0%
projections of more to come but whatever
 
01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
that is you put on top of that the
 
01:58:40.069 --> 01:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
19-year title cycle and um I just think
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's important here to have some
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
consistency and some durational
 
01:58:48.750 --> 01:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
consistency here and yes things things
 
01:58:52.109 --> 01:58:52.119 align:start position:0%
will change but you know um over the 19e
 
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
cycle the measurements will continue and
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
and adjustments um if there's underlying
 
01:59:00.109 --> 01:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
changes in uh you know ocean current
 
01:59:02.550 --> 01:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
circulation or sea level rise that those
 
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
things will be over the 19 years um you
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
know kind of adjusted uh as as that
 
01:59:10.990 --> 01:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
cycle goes through and and I you know
 
01:59:13.350 --> 01:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of cautious I I just think that
 
01:59:16.589 --> 01:59:16.599 align:start position:0%
we we need to give some consistency we
 
01:59:18.350 --> 01:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
need to let Property Owners know there's
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
some consistency over time that there
 
01:59:22.669 --> 01:59:22.679 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be you know extreme
 
01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
changes year to year that might affect
 
01:59:27.069 --> 01:59:27.079 align:start position:0%
their property's value or you know the
 
01:59:29.910 --> 01:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
public the public interest and that so I
 
01:59:32.109 --> 01:59:32.119 align:start position:0%
I just think this seems to be to be
 
01:59:34.629 --> 01:59:34.639 align:start position:0%
right uh as a as a way that we you know
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
measure it with consistency over time
 
01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
and some certainty and transparency to
 
01:59:41.950 --> 01:59:41.960 align:start position:0%
the to the property owners and to the to
 
01:59:42.910 --> 01:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
the public
 
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
interest thank you for an excellent
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
explanation Senator
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
Waters are there any other questions by
 
01:59:52.790 --> 01:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
members of the committee so I see no
 
01:59:55.390 --> 01:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
questions I seeing no questions and no
 
01:59:58.629 --> 01:59:58.639 align:start position:0%
questions from the uh
 
01:59:58.639 --> 02:00:00.470 align:start position:0%
questions from the uh
audience

02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%

you wish to speak on you're you're

it and gave some background but uh take
 
02:01:01.229 --> 02:01:01.239 align:start position:0%
it away sir no I just wanted to make
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
sure there were no questions mine was uh
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
the high water mark this was at the
 
02:01:10.870 --> 02:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
request of uh the department to make
 
02:01:14.109 --> 02:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
sure that we were up to date with our
 
02:01:18.830 --> 02:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
defining the uh high water mark so um I
 
02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:19.750 align:start position:0%
defining the uh high water mark so um I
just

02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:01:21.629 --> 02:01:21.639 align:start position:0%
I appreciate Senator waters's covering
 
02:01:23.229 --> 02:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
for me I just wanted to make sure
 
02:01:25.870 --> 02:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
everybody was all set if there's
 
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
questions well you've heard the uh the
 
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:29.679 align:start position:0%
discussion I'm not certain when you
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
tuned in uh but uh We've you whatever
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
you want wish to say on it we appreciate
 
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
it we'd like we'd like to hear you well
 
02:01:42.910 --> 02:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
this is you know this issue is is pretty
 
02:01:46.589 --> 02:01:46.599 align:start position:0%
technical uh and but it really brings us
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
up to date um and um and standardizes
 
02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
the language u in this area so uh the
 
02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
mean High Watermark as you know is is an
 
02:02:05.310 --> 02:02:05.320 align:start position:0%
important measure and
 
02:02:08.589 --> 02:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
um uh and so I was asked to introduce
 
02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
this as a way of ensuring that we are up
 
02:02:13.589 --> 02:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
to date in our
 
02:02:16.990 --> 02:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
statute uh with this definition so I
 
02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.589 --> 02:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
UMES post post oh representative post
 
02:02:29.189 --> 02:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you yes this is for
 
02:02:33.149 --> 02:02:33.159 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters um and I appreciate your
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
being here today and um helping us
 
02:02:37.790 --> 02:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
understand this my question is would
 
02:02:40.069 --> 02:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
this change insurance rates for
 
02:02:42.669 --> 02:02:42.679 align:start position:0%
homeowners is that theine when you
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
02:02:47.629 --> 02:02:47.639 align:start position:0%
um you know the
 
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
cost oh
 
02:02:51.069 --> 02:02:51.079 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer that if that's okay
 
02:02:53.709 --> 02:02:53.719 align:start position:0%
Senator Sherman of course yeah and and
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks for the question I'm
 
02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
really glad you brought that up because
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh no it would not um the insurance
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
rates are determined by FEMA Maps FEMA
 
02:03:05.470 --> 02:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
flood maps and uh FEMA releases those
 
02:03:08.069 --> 02:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
they've been updated fairly recently and
 
02:03:10.030 --> 02:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's what determines that and FEMA
 
02:03:13.390 --> 02:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
is basing that on a variety of other
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
historical uh issues um and not on this
 
02:03:19.790 --> 02:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
this particular definition
 
02:03:22.189 --> 02:03:22.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
02:03:25.790 --> 02:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:31.149 --> 02:03:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
question represent Smith sir uh
 
02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
you Senator Sherman um uh your colleague
 
02:03:48.069 --> 02:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters testified that uh the
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
definition of of high water mark was
 
02:03:53.149 --> 02:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
changed years ago but that one of our
 
02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
many many statutes was left out of when
 
02:03:58.149 --> 02:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
all of the other CH statutes were
 
02:04:02.189 --> 02:04:02.199 align:start position:0%
changed so am I correct in um assuming
 
02:04:04.589 --> 02:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
that this is a state statute this is not
 
02:04:07.069 --> 02:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
a federal definition of high water
 
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
Mark um I believe it is state but I
 
02:04:13.149 --> 02:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
think it is standard I would defer to
 
02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters if he knows the answer to
 
02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:17.159 align:start position:0%
that but my understanding is this is the
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
accepted definition
 
02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
along the at least the Eastern seab
 
02:04:27.870 --> 02:04:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:31.390 --> 02:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
mark and he's nodding so that would be
 
02:04:34.069 --> 02:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
correct a nodding is hard to hear
 
02:04:34.079 --> 02:04:37.069 align:start position:0%
correct a nodding is hard to hear
Senator

02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
wat excuse me and
 
02:04:42.910 --> 02:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
um uh you know I I I I'm I'm sorry I
 
02:04:44.830 --> 02:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
don't have the U hearing report from the
 
02:04:48.910 --> 02:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
senate in front of us um but uh I I
 
02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
believe that what Senator Sherman is
 
02:04:53.549 --> 02:04:53.559 align:start position:0%
representing here is is the case and I
 
02:04:55.390 --> 02:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
also believe this is pretty much the
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
standard if you're GNA if in State
 
02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
statue you're going to do it by um high
 
02:05:03.870 --> 02:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
waters this is the way to do it but
 
02:05:06.350 --> 02:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
every state is a lot of states in terms
 
02:05:08.750 --> 02:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
of the public interest is different are
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
different on this but this is what uh
 
02:05:15.790 --> 02:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
done any other any other questions Spang
 
02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
might have a question oh representative
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:27.549 --> 02:05:27.559 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
Spang you're
 
02:05:32.709 --> 02:05:32.719 align:start position:0%
muted there we go Senator Sherman thank
 
02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
you for coming and giving me another
 
02:05:36.830 --> 02:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
bite at the
 
02:05:40.350 --> 02:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
Apple yeah I'm um I spend a great deal
 
02:05:43.470 --> 02:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
of time on Cape Cod um and I think at
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
the cape like uh as in the Sea Coast
 
02:05:51.790 --> 02:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
here there are a lot of legal cases that
 
02:05:54.549 --> 02:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
come up about public access to high and
 
02:05:59.229 --> 02:05:59.239 align:start position:0%
low water um and perhaps Senator Waters
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
was um was Elum Illuminating that issue
 
02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit that that there may be um a
 
02:06:11.950 --> 02:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
different set of regulations regarding
 
02:06:14.430 --> 02:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
public access to high and low water
 
02:06:16.109 --> 02:06:16.119 align:start position:0%
areas say on a
 
02:06:19.229 --> 02:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
beach um and I I think that there's a
 
02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion um among people who who
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
want to use speaches on where they're
 
02:06:29.149 --> 02:06:29.159 align:start position:0%
allowed to be as a member of the public
 
02:06:31.629 --> 02:06:31.639 align:start position:0%
and where they're not so it's not just a
 
02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
matter of the property owners and where
 
02:06:36.430 --> 02:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
how close to the water they can build
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's also this ongoing battle between
 
02:06:42.910 --> 02:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
the public and um Beach users uh that is
 
02:06:44.510 --> 02:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
affected by this
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
definition um and secondary I'd like to
 
02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
know how uh
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
our regulations relate to those in other
 
02:06:57.950 --> 02:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
states um I would have to on the second
 
02:07:00.270 --> 02:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you for the questions I
 
02:07:01.870 --> 02:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
think they're really important but I
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
would have to defer on the second one
 
02:07:08.430 --> 02:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
because I'm not fully aware uh last time
 
02:07:11.430 --> 02:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
I looked at Massachusetts it was mean
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
high water had a specific definition
 
02:07:19.149 --> 02:07:19.159 align:start position:0%
um but I I really can't answer the
 
02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
public access we've had one of the most
 
02:07:24.669 --> 02:07:24.679 align:start position:0%
prominent Public Access issues in the
 
02:07:25.910 --> 02:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
state here in
 
02:07:29.709 --> 02:07:29.719 align:start position:0%
Ry um down at
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
um Saunders Point um and but that was
 
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
more of a private land public land and
 
02:07:39.870 --> 02:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
and public access was eventually granted
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
by the Supreme Court so it was uh
 
02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
but I guess what I would I would be able
 
02:07:48.510 --> 02:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
to say is that these definitions are
 
02:07:51.470 --> 02:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
critically important number one because
 
02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
of the issues that you pointed out but
 
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
also they need to be consistent
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
throughout statute and that's all this
 
02:07:59.790 --> 02:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
bill does is or this component of the
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
bill does is to make this one section
 
02:08:05.950 --> 02:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
now fully consistent through uh with the
 
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
other areas as Senator Waters had said
 
02:08:12.669 --> 02:08:12.679 align:start position:0%
great thank you I could offer something
 
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
on that as well is that you know just
 
02:08:16.830 --> 02:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
again to reiterate representative I
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
don't do not think that this change here
 
02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
this in this technical change in statute
 
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
has any practical effect on the public
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
trust shorelands area and people's
 
02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
access to it to answer the other part of
 
02:08:33.229 --> 02:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
your question you know you may see it in
 
02:08:35.390 --> 02:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
the news um lately because of some new
 
02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
lawsuits but Maine does it very
 
02:08:41.109 --> 02:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
differently uh in terms of what access
 
02:08:42.990 --> 02:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
is part of the public trust shorelands
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
and there was a main Supreme Court
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
decision back in 1996 which greatly
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
restricted Public Access and there's an
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
attempt now to revisit that but so as I
 
02:08:54.549 --> 02:08:54.559 align:start position:0%
said other states are different but for
 
02:08:56.510 --> 02:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this is a
 
02:08:58.750 --> 02:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
technical a technical definitional
 
02:08:59.870 --> 02:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
change I don't think there's any
 
02:09:02.430 --> 02:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
practical effect on public access or
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
public trust shorelands but it provides
 
02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:05.830 align:start position:0%
public trust shorelands but it provides
some

02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
consistency and transparency uh for
 
02:09:11.549 --> 02:09:11.559 align:start position:0%
property owners and for members of the
 
02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
public thank you thank
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
you no
 
02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
further me no further
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
questions uh from either none from the
 
02:09:23.679 --> 02:09:25.589 align:start position:0%
questions uh from either none from the
audience

02:09:25.589 --> 02:09:25.599 align:start position:0%
audience
 
02:09:32.149 --> 02:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
also okay I will close the uh discussion
 
02:09:37.709 --> 02:09:37.719 align:start position:0%
on uh on part six and that uh that
 
02:09:40.149 --> 02:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
should be all the that should be all
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
that uh we have as far
 
02:09:49.470 --> 02:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
as uh parts that are specific to re
 
02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:51.149 align:start position:0%
as uh parts that are specific to re
resources

02:09:51.149 --> 02:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
resources
 
02:09:54.510 --> 02:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh and that really takes care of the the
 
02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
morning for section of session on this
 
02:10:01.229 --> 02:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
bill at one o'clock we will be meeting
 
02:10:05.549 --> 02:10:05.559 align:start position:0%
for part three and five parts three and
 
02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
five with the help of fishing game it be
 
02:10:11.189 --> 02:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
one o'clock
 
02:10:11.199 --> 02:10:12.830 align:start position:0%

02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh so that's I will there is some other
 
02:10:20.910 --> 02:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
business I want to go with the go over
 
02:10:24.549 --> 02:10:24.559 align:start position:0%

bill of
 
02:11:02.549 --> 02:11:02.559 align:start position:0%
106 the uh during the during the interim
 
02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
so we're just going to be doing uh other
 
02:11:09.109 --> 02:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
business see uh anyone who's not part of
 
02:11:15.069 --> 02:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:11:19.589 --> 02:11:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh you could there's you can listen but
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%

02:11:22.709 --> 02:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
business that we're going to be
 
02:11:28.549 --> 02:11:28.559 align:start position:0%
discussing is some uh committee some
 
02:11:31.390 --> 02:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
U Senate
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh Senate amendments to some uh some
 
02:11:40.470 --> 02:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
bills that some house bills that we
 
02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
passed uh was a house bill 115 and I
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
think it's 311 correct uh representative
 
02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
Smith yes that is correct and
 
02:11:59.229 --> 02:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
uh why don't uh you you were the prime
 
02:12:03.790 --> 02:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
you were Prime on uh the with 311 or or
 
02:12:05.229 --> 02:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
was it on
 
02:12:07.950 --> 02:12:07.960 align:start position:0%
115 well I'm Prime sponsor on both of
 
02:12:11.310 --> 02:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
them oh okay then you might as well I
 
02:12:13.069 --> 02:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
might as well recognize you would you
 
02:12:17.069 --> 02:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
gone actually I have my own you have
 
02:12:23.189 --> 02:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:30.030 --> 02:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
okay um so actually um House Bill uh 115
 
02:12:32.109 --> 02:12:32.119 align:start position:0%
was the wake surfing bill it was the
 
02:12:34.870 --> 02:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
safety bill that passed the house
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
unanimously went over to the Senate and
 
02:12:41.149 --> 02:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
um one of the questions brought up by
 
02:12:43.310 --> 02:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
one of the Senators was that the part of
 
02:12:46.510 --> 02:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
the bill that said that um because of
 
02:12:49.069 --> 02:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
wake surfing does not use a tow rope and
 
02:12:53.310 --> 02:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
the person is directly behind the boat
 
02:12:56.229 --> 02:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
um in the water that they could only use
 
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
a boat specifically designed for that
 
02:13:01.750 --> 02:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
purpose and one of the Senators
 
02:13:04.589 --> 02:13:04.599 align:start position:0%
questioned did we really need the word
 
02:13:07.030 --> 02:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
specifically was wasn't just designed
 
02:13:08.830 --> 02:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
for that purpose
 
02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:11.109 align:start position:0%
for that purpose
enough

02:13:11.109 --> 02:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:13:13.629 --> 02:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
um Captain dun leevy said he didn't
 
02:13:15.549 --> 02:13:15.559 align:start position:0%
think that would change anything as far
 
02:13:20.109 --> 02:13:20.119 align:start position:0%
as enforcement went and um so I that's
 
02:13:22.390 --> 02:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
the explanation of that one word was
 
02:13:25.830 --> 02:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:29.589 --> 02:13:29.599 align:start position:0%
bill anyone has any questions about it
 
02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
or comments because what we'll need to
 
02:13:36.750 --> 02:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
do is uh for new people um when the
 
02:13:39.149 --> 02:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
Senate amends a bill that passed the
 
02:13:41.709 --> 02:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
house the bill then comes back
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
informally to the committee where the
 
02:13:47.950 --> 02:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
bill was passed originally and me
 
02:13:50.390 --> 02:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee either concur
 
02:13:53.589 --> 02:13:53.599 align:start position:0%
with the change the Senate made and or
 
02:13:56.669 --> 02:13:56.679 align:start position:0%
not Concur and the bill dies or not
 
02:13:58.990 --> 02:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
Concur and ask for a committee of
 
02:14:01.470 --> 02:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
conference um so this will something we
 
02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
will be asked the committee chair will
 
02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
be asked to make a motion to concur or
 
02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
not um next and in one of the upcoming
 
02:14:14.109 --> 02:14:14.119 align:start position:0%
uh full sessions that we have but it's
 
02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
always nice to discuss these things with
 
02:14:17.669 --> 02:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
the committee in case people have
 
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:25.109 --> 02:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
so send out to
 
02:14:27.470 --> 02:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
everyone side by
 
02:14:30.709 --> 02:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
sides uh especially for
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
the for new folks it's a it's a way of
 
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
being able to see where the changes are
 
02:14:40.549 --> 02:14:40.559 align:start position:0%
without having to read every every word
 
02:14:44.669 --> 02:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
and keep going back and for the the
 
02:14:47.229 --> 02:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
committee the committee assistant does
 
02:14:49.709 --> 02:14:49.719 align:start position:0%
basically does for you and and we'll
 
02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
highlight where exactly the U the
 
02:15:00.069 --> 02:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
changes are and you can regly see it uh
 
02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
the uh what H what the normal procedure
 
02:15:07.310 --> 02:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
is it's a little a little Loosey Goosey
 
02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
when it comes
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
to concurs nonc concurs nonring
 
02:15:18.030 --> 02:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
requesting a commit of conference uh I
 
02:15:20.149 --> 02:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
was surprised even somebody who been
 
02:15:24.069 --> 02:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
around as long as I have uh that
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
actually the the the authority rest
 
02:15:31.390 --> 02:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
solely with the chair as far as whether
 
02:15:34.350 --> 02:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
do concur
 
02:15:38.109 --> 02:15:38.119 align:start position:0%
notur confence but it's foolish to even
 
02:15:39.790 --> 02:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
do it without
 
02:15:42.430 --> 02:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
consulting your committee and that's
 
02:15:46.910 --> 02:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
what what I'm doing now is try to get
 
02:15:48.350 --> 02:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
everybody's understand understanding
 
02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:51.270 align:start position:0%
everybody's understand understanding
what's

02:15:51.270 --> 02:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
happening representative Smith has
 
02:15:56.430 --> 02:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
explained what this the difference in
 
02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:57.390 align:start position:0%
explained what this the difference in
this

02:15:57.390 --> 02:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:15:59.830 --> 02:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
fill so you
 
02:16:02.750 --> 02:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
see she explained it is
 
02:16:06.149 --> 02:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
minuscule so a minor change and doesn't
 
02:16:08.910 --> 02:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
really affect the bill Le to my tination
 
02:16:11.229 --> 02:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
but I think I'd like to get concurrence
 
02:16:12.669 --> 02:16:12.679 align:start position:0%
from everyone here we don't need a
 
02:16:12.679 --> 02:16:14.149 align:start position:0%
from everyone here we don't need a
formal

02:16:14.149 --> 02:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
formal
 
02:16:18.270 --> 02:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
vote but I I'd like to have
 
02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:19.310 align:start position:0%
vote but I I'd like to have
uh

02:16:19.310 --> 02:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
a an
 
02:16:25.149 --> 02:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
affirmation a consensus from members of
 
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
the of the committee uh so what I'll do
 
02:16:31.310 --> 02:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
is just simply say is there anyone who
 
02:16:42.589 --> 02:16:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
concurring yes thank you I'm sorry are
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
we including um the first part also
 
02:16:55.469 --> 02:16:55.479 align:start position:0%
um I see the I see the change so what
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
you have up on the screen is the second
 
02:17:03.070 --> 02:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
part of that on the propulsion system
 
02:17:08.070 --> 02:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
but if you go back to the wake surfing
 
02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:09.990 align:start position:0%
but if you go back to the wake surfing
issue

02:17:09.990 --> 02:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:17:14.270 --> 02:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
which um that is this if you go back to
 
02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:15.589 align:start position:0%
which um that is this if you go back to
page

02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
one see I can't see that
 
02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:20.270 align:start position:0%
one see I can't see that
okay

02:17:20.270 --> 02:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:17:23.429 --> 02:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
so where it says new paragraph voting it
 
02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
says number one new paragraph voting
 
02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
it's the second box down these appear to
 
02:17:31.230 --> 02:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
be identical can you tell me what the
 
02:17:34.589 --> 02:17:34.599 align:start position:0%
difference might be when you read this I
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
didn't see anything
 
02:17:39.950 --> 02:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
different from the house bill to the
 
02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:41.950 align:start position:0%
different from the house bill to the
Senate

02:17:41.950 --> 02:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
02:17:46.910 --> 02:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
bill is only one word only one word yeah
 
02:17:49.629 --> 02:17:49.639 align:start position:0%
so when you're looking at the um you're
 
02:17:51.309 --> 02:17:51.319 align:start position:0%
first you're looking at the house bill
 
02:17:53.709 --> 02:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
then you're looking at the Senate bill
 
02:17:56.349 --> 02:17:56.359 align:start position:0%
and in the third column are what the
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
changes are so as you can see in the
 
02:18:01.309 --> 02:18:01.319 align:start position:0%
third column there's no changes anywhere
 
02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
except when we get down propulsion
 
02:18:06.429 --> 02:18:06.439 align:start position:0%
system okay thank you for clarifying
 
02:18:12.830 --> 02:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
asking any change is in the the far I
 
02:18:23.429 --> 02:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:23.439 --> 02:18:24.990 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:18:24.990 --> 02:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:18:27.629 --> 02:18:27.639 align:start position:0%
uh so on
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
the on
 
02:18:34.429 --> 02:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
115 hear how about this I have any uh
 
02:18:38.830 --> 02:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
any objections to to concurring
 
02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:44.070 align:start position:0%
any objections to to concurring
115

02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
no say no
 
02:18:48.349 --> 02:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
objections we will
 
02:18:52.469 --> 02:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
I will I will write to the to the
 
02:18:56.509 --> 02:18:56.519 align:start position:0%
clerk let them know that it is that we
 
02:18:58.709 --> 02:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
will confer with
 
02:19:03.349 --> 02:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
the with the Senate
 
02:19:07.790 --> 02:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
311 yes so House Bill 311 was the um the
 
02:19:18.910 --> 02:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
bill to form a committee to study the um
 
02:19:21.629 --> 02:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
the formation and the use of rail trails
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
and to develop best management practices
 
02:19:27.070 --> 02:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
for dealing with the surfaces or any
 
02:19:30.030 --> 02:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
contaminants that could be there um when
 
02:19:31.790 --> 02:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
this bill went to the
 
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
Senate It Was Heard by the
 
02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:35.589 align:start position:0%
Senate It Was Heard by the
transportation

02:19:35.589 --> 02:19:35.599 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
committee now in in our so-called
 
02:19:42.030 --> 02:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
resources Recreation and development
 
02:19:44.990 --> 02:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee we hear bills related to rail
 
02:19:47.669 --> 02:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
trails in the Senate the transportation
 
02:19:50.110 --> 02:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
committee does so
 
02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
they and I agreed that the one member
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
being a part of the Senate energy and
 
02:19:59.790 --> 02:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
natural resources committee wasn't the
 
02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate Senate member and I
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
suggested they amend it to say it was
 
02:20:06.910 --> 02:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
someone from the Transportation
 
02:20:08.830 --> 02:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
committee the Senate their Infinite
 
02:20:10.790 --> 02:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
Wisdom said the member could be any
 
02:20:13.070 --> 02:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
member of the Senate but that member
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
would be appointed by the president of
 
02:20:17.550 --> 02:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate so that was the only change
 
02:20:19.630 --> 02:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
it was just who was going to appoint the
 
02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:20.910 align:start position:0%
it was just who was going to appoint the
Senate

02:20:20.910 --> 02:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
member and other than that the bill is
 
02:20:30.230 --> 02:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:33.110 --> 02:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
house everybody see
 
02:20:36.270 --> 02:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
that I mean
 
02:20:39.469 --> 02:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
uh it it would appear to me I would I
 
02:20:42.590 --> 02:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
personally would wish to concur there's
 
02:20:48.750 --> 02:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh any any uh any opposition to that
 
02:20:51.389 --> 02:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
any concerns on that uh no hands raised
 
02:20:54.349 --> 02:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
sir okay there's no hands I I will take
 
02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
that to mean that we on House Bill
 
02:21:02.510 --> 02:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
311 that we will we we will concur with
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
the changes of the that the Senate have
 
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
made and what will happen now is I will
 
02:21:11.309 --> 02:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
let this let let the clerk of the house
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
know and uh and we'll
 
02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
then uh it this will be
 
02:21:21.230 --> 02:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
taken care of at the next time we have a
 
02:21:25.110 --> 02:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh a session which will probably
 
02:21:29.349 --> 02:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
be in this in the in in the future can't
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
be in the it isn't going to be now and
 
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:37.150 --> 02:21:37.160 align:start position:0%
later I can't I can't tell you when
 
02:21:40.590 --> 02:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
exactly but it will be held it has to be
 
02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
in a in a uh in a public
 
02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
session in a house session so being that
 
02:21:51.469 --> 02:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
I think uh we're that's all the business
 
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
I have but we'll meet we can break for a
 
02:21:55.630 --> 02:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
little long
 
02:22:02.670 --> 02:22:02.680 align:start position:0%

04:02:05.229 --> 04:02:05.239 align:start position:0%
my home committee from when I was in the
 
04:02:08.389 --> 04:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
in the house so I'm Senator David Waters
 
04:02:10.830 --> 04:02:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh from District 4 and I'm introducing
 
04:02:13.710 --> 04:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
part three of Senate Bill
 
04:02:16.670 --> 04:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
146 and this part uh deals with the
 
04:02:19.429 --> 04:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
prevention of zoonotic disease
 
04:02:21.910 --> 04:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
transmission and certainly we've heard
 
04:02:23.550 --> 04:02:23.560 align:start position:0%
way too much about these and the
 
04:02:25.469 --> 04:02:25.479 align:start position:0%
consequences that we're all living under
 
04:02:28.870 --> 04:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
these These Days uh so this is a bill
 
04:02:31.710 --> 04:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
that helps us be prepared and uh it lets
 
04:02:34.110 --> 04:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
us be prepared and to monitor things but
 
04:02:36.189 --> 04:02:36.199 align:start position:0%
also takes a couple practical steps that
 
04:02:39.070 --> 04:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
we can take right now to uh keep people
 
04:02:40.189 --> 04:02:40.199 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
livestock uh safe in the state of State
 
04:02:44.149 --> 04:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
of New
 
04:02:46.510 --> 04:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the key the core of the
 
04:02:49.870 --> 04:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
bill uh is in um section three New
 
04:02:51.110 --> 04:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs to prepare for the
 
04:02:53.070 --> 04:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
emergency and management of Novel
 
04:02:55.149 --> 04:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
xonotic pathogens that may threaten

Public Health Food security biological
 
04:03:01.790 --> 04:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
diversity and economic um security and
 
04:03:04.269 --> 04:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
the reason we need to do this is that
 
04:03:07.070 --> 04:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
while there are some controls over the
 
04:03:07.080 --> 04:03:08.990 align:start position:0%
while there are some controls over the
importation

04:03:08.990 --> 04:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
importation
 
04:03:11.750 --> 04:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
of uh of species that might carry
 
04:03:15.469 --> 04:03:15.479 align:start position:0%
xonotic diseases under sites that's the
 
04:03:18.070 --> 04:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh convention on international trade and
 
04:03:21.510 --> 04:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
endangered species um that that Federal
 
04:03:25.110 --> 04:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
Regulation it just regulates endangered
 
04:03:27.950 --> 04:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
species and also as we learned when we
 
04:03:29.750 --> 04:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
did the wildlife trafficking laws a
 
04:03:31.870 --> 04:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
couple years ago um the federal
 
04:03:35.030 --> 04:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
government just does uh interstate and
 
04:03:37.030 --> 04:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
they don't do any enforcement regulation
 
04:03:39.269 --> 04:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
within the state and that's why we need
 
04:03:41.590 --> 04:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
to keep an eye on what's Happening uh
 
04:03:45.269 --> 04:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
here so the first part of the um Bill
 
04:03:47.790 --> 04:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
essentially um gets the director of Fish
 
04:03:49.990 --> 04:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
and Game to monitor available
 
04:03:52.550 --> 04:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
information on animals and fish and as
 
04:03:56.990 --> 04:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
these May emerge and uh in so doing you
 
04:03:58.309 --> 04:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
know consult with Health and Human
 
04:04:01.149 --> 04:04:01.159 align:start position:0%
Services um State veterinarian um
 
04:04:03.870 --> 04:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
scientific institutions just as a way of
 
04:04:06.070 --> 04:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
keeping an eye on what may be emerging
 
04:04:09.710 --> 04:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and uh and elsewhere
 
04:04:12.349 --> 04:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank um particularly uh
 
04:04:15.429 --> 04:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
director of fishing game Mason and Paul
 
04:04:18.309 --> 04:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
Sanderson and fishing game and also uh
 
04:04:20.750 --> 04:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Agriculture Jasper who
 
04:04:22.670 --> 04:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
really helped so much in bringing to
 
04:04:24.469 --> 04:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
this bill to a point that'll work for
 
04:04:26.510 --> 04:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and this is one of those
 
04:04:29.510 --> 04:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
important um important points here is
 
04:04:32.349 --> 04:04:32.359 align:start position:0%
that the fishing game director then can
 
04:04:34.110 --> 04:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on this and if something
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
emerges can recommend to the legislature
 
04:04:40.110 --> 04:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
legislation or rules but I think in
 
04:04:41.750 --> 04:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
light of what we've recently seen
 
04:04:43.550 --> 04:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps even more importantly is to say
 
04:04:45.309 --> 04:04:45.319 align:start position:0%
to the governor hey we've got to have
 
04:04:48.030 --> 04:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
some emergency action on um what is
 
04:04:51.149 --> 04:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
potentially um emerging the second part
 
04:04:53.469 --> 04:04:53.479 align:start position:0%
of the bill um takes some practical
 
04:04:55.950 --> 04:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
steps that we can do now to make sure
 
04:04:58.910 --> 04:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
that uh our live animal markets don't
 
04:05:02.229 --> 04:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
become perhaps the the sources for these
 
04:05:04.630 --> 04:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
disease uh vectors so you get some
 
04:05:07.630 --> 04:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
definitions here which um are meant to
 
04:05:10.550 --> 04:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
you provide Clarity of just what uh
 
04:05:13.990 --> 04:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
we're covering in live animal markets
 
04:05:16.910 --> 04:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
and then um you'll see down around line
 
04:05:20.469 --> 04:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
11 it's just do this Common Sense
 
04:05:23.750 --> 04:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
regulation uh that if you have an animal
 
04:05:25.950 --> 04:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
that is been
 
04:05:29.149 --> 04:05:29.159 align:start position:0%
identified uh that a taxon known to be
 
04:05:31.189 --> 04:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
likely responsible for CTIC
 
04:05:33.990 --> 04:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
transmission um then it should not be
 
04:05:38.309 --> 04:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
offered for sale in a market um then
 
04:05:41.070 --> 04:05:41.080 align:start position:0%
secondly um Wildlife species that are
 
04:05:44.349 --> 04:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
identified as such should not be
 
04:05:47.630 --> 04:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
caged uh or transported with livestock
 
04:05:50.189 --> 04:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
or domestic animals because you know it
 
04:05:53.469 --> 04:05:53.479 align:start position:0%
can get into that that uh pool of of uh
 
04:05:56.389 --> 04:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
animals and um that's not as that that's
 
04:05:58.790 --> 04:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
not good um
 
04:06:03.030 --> 04:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
either and um then uh a little bit
 
04:06:05.670 --> 04:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
further on um as I mentioned cites and
 
04:06:07.950 --> 04:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
endangered species and Wildlife
 
04:06:10.030 --> 04:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
trafficking um there are some species
 
04:06:11.750 --> 04:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
that just aren't covered under those
 
04:06:13.389 --> 04:06:13.399 align:start position:0%
that we want to make sure are not being
 
04:06:15.149 --> 04:06:15.159 align:start position:0%
offered for sale because they can
 
04:06:15.159 --> 04:06:16.189 align:start position:0%
offered for sale because they can
transmit

04:06:16.189 --> 04:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
transmit
 
04:06:21.990 --> 04:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
diseases bats need I say um rodents or
 
04:06:24.550 --> 04:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
primate species are ones that we can
 
04:06:26.110 --> 04:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
make sure right now that we're not going
 
04:06:30.070 --> 04:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
to have in live animal uh
 
04:06:33.030 --> 04:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
markets and then um as is appropriate
 
04:06:36.389 --> 04:06:36.399 align:start position:0%
rules will be adopted um governing a
 
04:06:37.990 --> 04:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
store and sale of animals and life live
 
04:06:41.670 --> 04:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
animal uh markets and live Wildlife uh
 
04:06:44.110 --> 04:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
markets and then really important the
 
04:06:47.990 --> 04:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
exceptions um that we have here just to
 
04:06:51.269 --> 04:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that um this has no impact
 
04:06:54.189 --> 04:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
whatsoever on current livestock
 
04:06:57.229 --> 04:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
markets uh or the offer of sale of
 
04:06:59.229 --> 04:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
livestock that are currently allowed
 
04:07:01.790 --> 04:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law so this is
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
completely outside of it doesn't doesn't
 
04:07:05.710 --> 04:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
affect that same thing with shellfish so
 
04:07:07.790 --> 04:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
you want to get your Lobster you want
 
04:07:10.229 --> 04:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
want to get your your oysters or you
 
04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
want to get your chickens or your or
 
04:07:15.830 --> 04:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
your beef um this does not uh affect
 
04:07:18.070 --> 04:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
affect that and then there are a couple
 
04:07:20.710 --> 04:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
penalties there that uh seem rather
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
rather appropriate um of course written
 
04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
warning first usually would would
 
04:07:26.710 --> 04:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
suffice and if someone continues to
 
04:07:29.990 --> 04:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
violate then there'd be a fine as well
 
04:07:32.269 --> 04:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if we had any former boy
 
04:07:34.149 --> 04:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
scouts out there Girl Scouts but be
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
prepared be prepared and I think this is
 
04:07:38.429 --> 04:07:38.439 align:start position:0%
just some common sense and simple simple
 
04:07:41.389 --> 04:07:41.399 align:start position:0%
things we can do and again my many
 
04:07:44.630 --> 04:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
thanks to um director Mason and to
 
04:07:47.550 --> 04:07:47.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper for um helping
 
04:07:49.349 --> 04:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
create a bill that everybody thinks is a
 
04:07:51.550 --> 04:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
good idea for New Hampshire uh thank you
 
04:07:55.870 --> 04:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:00.309 --> 04:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
questions chairman Lang like take over
 
04:08:04.510 --> 04:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
for having putting some questions from
 
04:08:06.189 --> 04:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
your committee great thank you I will do
 
04:08:08.670 --> 04:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chairman um I'll start
 
04:08:10.229 --> 04:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
off with a couple questions of my own if
 
04:08:13.510 --> 04:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
you don't mind Senator um so I I'm looks
 
04:08:16.309 --> 04:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
like this bill allows for three
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
potential actions to be taken if an
 
04:08:21.349 --> 04:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
animal is deemed to to uh be able to do
 
04:08:23.229 --> 04:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
this transmission one of which is
 
04:08:25.149 --> 04:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
legislation one of which is rules and
 
04:08:27.109 --> 04:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
the third one with it is an emergency
 
04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
order uh with the governor and my my
 
04:08:32.189 --> 04:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
concern is around two things number one
 
04:08:33.870 --> 04:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
timing legislations we know could take
 
04:08:36.510 --> 04:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
over a year to get through the house or
 
04:08:38.309 --> 04:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
Senate and act
 
04:08:40.750 --> 04:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
um rules I think the shortest process
 
04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
for rules is about three to six months
 
04:08:46.429 --> 04:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
if you really tighten things up and so
 
04:08:48.349 --> 04:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
the last one that's left is for an act
 
04:08:50.429 --> 04:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
for immediate action if we decide that
 
04:08:53.109 --> 04:08:53.119 align:start position:0%
it's necessary is an emergency order but
 
04:08:54.670 --> 04:08:54.680 align:start position:0%
I think that would to do an emergency
 
04:08:56.070 --> 04:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
order you'd have to have a declaration
 
04:08:59.309 --> 04:08:59.319 align:start position:0%
of emergency under 4 colon 45 so I'm
 
04:09:01.269 --> 04:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
wondering whether that last section
 
04:09:03.229 --> 04:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
should read executive order versus
 
04:09:06.469 --> 04:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
emergency order thank you Mr chairman I
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
I I thank so much for that for catching
 
04:09:11.269 --> 04:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
that you're absolutely right about that
 
04:09:13.309 --> 04:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
and um you know I I think that's our
 
04:09:15.990 --> 04:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
fail safe here uh given what you said
 
04:09:17.550 --> 04:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
about legislative process that if
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
something's got to be done it's got to
 
04:09:21.710 --> 04:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
be done fast huh um and I saw emergency
 
04:09:23.349 --> 04:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
order really is what it excuse me
 
04:09:25.710 --> 04:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
executive order is what it should say on
 
04:09:28.990 --> 04:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
your other points about how we can act I
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
mean of course it is that is true but um
 
04:09:35.550 --> 04:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
right now we can do the rul making on
 
04:09:39.109 --> 04:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
the um markets and uh that that is
 
04:09:40.990 --> 04:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
something can be done and you know we
 
04:09:42.830 --> 04:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
we're not in a situation right now that
 
04:09:44.590 --> 04:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
you know that there's immediately a
 
04:09:46.109 --> 04:09:46.119 align:start position:0%
problem has to be addressed so that Ru
 
04:09:47.910 --> 04:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
making can take place again so that it
 
04:09:50.790 --> 04:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
would be in place you know say if next
 
04:09:54.189 --> 04:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
year something came up um that we would
 
04:09:56.630 --> 04:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
we would need need that of course part
 
04:09:58.429 --> 04:09:58.439 align:start position:0%
of the bill that says the prohibiting
 
04:10:00.870 --> 04:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
the importation of these taxons will
 
04:10:04.510 --> 04:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
take effect upon upon passage so um you
 
04:10:07.510 --> 04:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
know the bill is meant to address the
 
04:10:09.510 --> 04:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
future as much as it is to give some
 
04:10:11.790 --> 04:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
Authority right now to figure out what's
 
04:10:13.710 --> 04:10:13.720 align:start position:0%
going on and get some action if we need
 
04:10:15.910 --> 04:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
it thank you Senator representative
 
04:10:18.229 --> 04:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
Spain has a question thank you Mr chair
 
04:10:19.750 --> 04:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking the
 
04:10:24.590 --> 04:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
question um in that same vein of of uh
 
04:10:26.269 --> 04:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
questioning there's nothing that
 
04:10:27.990 --> 04:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
prohibits the legislature from going
 
04:10:30.349 --> 04:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
ahead and enacting a law anyway so the
 
04:10:31.830 --> 04:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
only part of this that's actually
 
04:10:33.670 --> 04:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
applicable is that the department would
 
04:10:36.910 --> 04:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation of a law that is
 
04:10:39.990 --> 04:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh necess Neary and again that's a long
 
04:10:42.389 --> 04:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
process is that is that
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
correct um thanks for the question well
 
04:10:48.790 --> 04:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know I guess it's it's partly an
 
04:10:50.590 --> 04:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
issue of timing as always that if
 
04:10:54.189 --> 04:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
something is happening right now the the
 
04:10:57.070 --> 04:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
um fishing game director is the one
 
04:10:58.670 --> 04:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
who's going to be monitoring that
 
04:10:59.910 --> 04:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
getting the
 
04:11:03.030 --> 04:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
reports um through the various networks
 
04:11:05.149 --> 04:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
from Health and Human Services um where
 
04:11:07.630 --> 04:11:07.640 align:start position:0%
that information comes from this is the
 
04:11:10.189 --> 04:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
director becomes the person who can um
 
04:11:13.429 --> 04:11:13.439 align:start position:0%
see what's going on and then uh make
 
04:11:15.109 --> 04:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations now it might be
 
04:11:16.750 --> 04:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
immediate action and that's the
 
04:11:19.269 --> 04:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
executive order but it also might be is
 
04:11:21.950 --> 04:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
that we have it seems as if there's a
 
04:11:24.910 --> 04:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
species that um may be emerging as a
 
04:11:29.790 --> 04:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
risk and maybe we ought to um do that or
 
04:11:31.710 --> 04:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
as time goes by if it looks like there
 
04:11:34.309 --> 04:11:34.319 align:start position:0%
developments in um live animal markets
 
04:11:36.429 --> 04:11:36.439 align:start position:0%
that we hadn't anticipated um but that
 
04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
are not an immediate emergency
 
04:11:41.030 --> 04:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
legislation could be recommended the
 
04:11:42.550 --> 04:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
second part of the bill right now on
 
04:11:44.309 --> 04:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
live animal markets though I think does
 
04:11:46.630 --> 04:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
some stuff we' we've got to do right now
 
04:11:49.229 --> 04:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
um we got to make sure you know bats and
 
04:11:50.990 --> 04:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
rodents and some others are not being
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
sold I think we have to right now it' be
 
04:11:56.429 --> 04:11:56.439 align:start position:0%
pretty smart to make sure we're not
 
04:11:58.750 --> 04:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
transporting uh these taxons with
 
04:11:58.760 --> 04:11:59.790 align:start position:0%
transporting uh these taxons with
domestic

04:11:59.790 --> 04:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
domestic
 
04:12:03.429 --> 04:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
animals um so these are things I think
 
04:12:05.870 --> 04:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
again we you know better safe than sorry
 
04:12:08.030 --> 04:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
and we can do this now
 
04:12:10.189 --> 04:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
followup represent thank you Mr chair
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a followup and it did touch
 
04:12:13.149 --> 04:12:13.159 align:start position:0%
on that other section you were talking
 
04:12:18.309 --> 04:12:18.319 align:start position:0%
about um I actually um I don't know from
 
04:12:19.870 --> 04:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
coming from the fishing game department
 
04:12:21.710 --> 04:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
I I kind of wish that agriculture was in
 
04:12:23.790 --> 04:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
on this one as well because I do not
 
04:12:27.149 --> 04:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
know um what the livestock markets
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
currently allow to be sold alive whether
 
04:12:32.590 --> 04:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
that includes uh foul like chickens or
 
04:12:36.550 --> 04:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
consumption and such um and I assume
 
04:12:39.510 --> 04:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
that gentic disease would also include
 
04:12:42.149 --> 04:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
mad cow disease which could be
 
04:12:43.910 --> 04:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
considered something that's not on a
 
04:12:46.389 --> 04:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
wildlife situation and necessarily our
 
04:12:47.750 --> 04:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
our fish and game director wouldn't
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
catch that it would be the agriculture
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
director who would catch that so I kind
 
04:12:53.269 --> 04:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
of wish that that we had some bleed into
 
04:12:55.070 --> 04:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
the agriculture department on some of
 
04:12:57.670 --> 04:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
these aspects for the wet markets or or
 
04:13:00.030 --> 04:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
um live animal markets as they're called
 
04:13:03.750 --> 04:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
here um am I correct that life mad cow
 
04:13:05.349 --> 04:13:05.359 align:start position:0%
disease transmissible from animal to
 
04:13:06.670 --> 04:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
human would be considered under this
 
04:13:06.680 --> 04:13:07.950 align:start position:0%
human would be considered under this
category

04:13:07.950 --> 04:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
category
 
04:13:10.630 --> 04:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
and um do you have any insight as to
 
04:13:12.590 --> 04:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
what animals currently allowed in those
 
04:13:12.600 --> 04:13:14.189 align:start position:0%
what animals currently allowed in those
those

04:13:14.189 --> 04:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
markets thanks for the question and um
 
04:13:18.790 --> 04:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
you know I I did have a lot of
 
04:13:20.910 --> 04:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
conversation with commissioner Jasper on
 
04:13:23.830 --> 04:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
this and um I'm sure he would welcome a
 
04:13:27.349 --> 04:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
call and so I I'll try to remember that
 
04:13:29.830 --> 04:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
and actually you know um Paul Sanderson
 
04:13:32.070 --> 04:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
I believe is on the call he's provided
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
on the test on the hearing and I think
 
04:13:35.030 --> 04:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
he and I know he's provided some
 
04:13:36.189 --> 04:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
testimony and he was on his
 
04:13:37.710 --> 04:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
conversations as well so he may be able
 
04:13:40.990 --> 04:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
to be a little more thorough on this um
 
04:13:44.790 --> 04:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
but you know the livestock markets um we
 
04:13:47.389 --> 04:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
have you know for the most part slaugher
 
04:13:50.189 --> 04:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
houses are are where most um of most
 
04:13:51.910 --> 04:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
animals get processed and we have a
 
04:13:53.910 --> 04:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
system of that and inspection system and
 
04:13:56.429 --> 04:13:56.439 align:start position:0%
the um commissioner Jasper Jasper is
 
04:14:00.790 --> 04:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
very confident about about that um and
 
04:14:02.830 --> 04:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
then on a mad cow disease as well I
 
04:14:04.469 --> 04:14:04.479 align:start position:0%
think there there are currently testing
 
04:14:07.189 --> 04:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
and procedures and protocols about that
 
04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
God forbid if it should uh if it should
 
04:14:13.389 --> 04:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
appear um here um I think what we're
 
04:14:15.109 --> 04:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
trying to capture are some of the
 
04:14:18.030 --> 04:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
smaller places smaller
 
04:14:21.469 --> 04:14:21.479 align:start position:0%
markets um take out you know places that
 
04:14:23.870 --> 04:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
that uh that there may be some live
 
04:14:25.670 --> 04:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
animals that are being that are being
 
04:14:28.870 --> 04:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
sold and and uh slaughtered on premise
 
04:14:30.229 --> 04:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're trying to catch
 
04:14:32.149 --> 04:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
here to make sure that we have have
 
04:14:34.950 --> 04:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
regulation on that um that it makes it
 
04:14:36.550 --> 04:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
very explicit down below that
 
04:14:38.309 --> 04:14:38.319 align:start position:0%
essentially saying everything that's in
 
04:14:41.030 --> 04:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
those exemptions about livestock are
 
04:14:43.389 --> 04:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
saying yeah agriculture's taking care of
 
04:14:46.309 --> 04:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
that um and the shellfish markets and
 
04:14:48.030 --> 04:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
things yeah fishing game's already taken
 
04:14:50.309 --> 04:14:50.319 align:start position:0%
care of that but these live markets as
 
04:14:51.630 --> 04:14:51.640 align:start position:0%
they're defined in the definition
 
04:14:53.510 --> 04:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
sections are what we we want to make
 
04:14:56.349 --> 04:14:56.359 align:start position:0%
sure because as we all know um that's
 
04:14:58.910 --> 04:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
where not only are these you know that
 
04:15:01.189 --> 04:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
that it's not only in you know in
 
04:15:04.030 --> 04:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
overseas we've seen this um but you know
 
04:15:05.590 --> 04:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
they are pretty substantial live animal
 
04:15:08.389 --> 04:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
markets in some cities in United States
 
04:15:11.070 --> 04:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
and uh not too far from here and um you
 
04:15:12.870 --> 04:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
know the anticipation is that we
 
04:15:15.109 --> 04:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
probably ought to make sure we're ready
 
04:15:17.229 --> 04:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
if they start to become more prevalent
 
04:15:19.389 --> 04:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
in New
 
04:15:21.510 --> 04:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I hope that gets at it
 
04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
that'ss it Representatives plane but um
 
04:15:26.269 --> 04:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
you know I I'm commissioner Jasper would
 
04:15:28.590 --> 04:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
be glad to talk to thank
 
04:15:31.309 --> 04:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
you represent I'd also direct your

area line 21 which gives the Department
 
04:15:38.269 --> 04:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture culture certain amount of
 
04:15:40.189 --> 04:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
Ru making authority to help manage this

section
 
04:16:39.870 --> 04:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
three I noted that you said no sale of
 
04:16:42.990 --> 04:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
live markets with rodents and uh and
 
04:16:46.630 --> 04:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
primates well those are very commonly uh
 
04:16:49.269 --> 04:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
test animals as there already Provisions
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
in the Hampshire law for providing these
 
04:16:57.710 --> 04:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
animals to uh Laboratories in state for
 
04:16:59.469 --> 04:16:59.479 align:start position:0%
experimentation uh thank you for your
 
04:17:01.429 --> 04:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
question um there is statute govering
 
04:17:03.469 --> 04:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
that already and but more more
 
04:17:05.710 --> 04:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
particularly um that is governed by
 
04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
research protocol
 
04:17:09.429 --> 04:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
uh that are you know having taught at
 
04:17:10.990 --> 04:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
UNH for a long time although my
 
04:17:13.389 --> 04:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
experiment was in an English Department
 
04:17:15.630 --> 04:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
so my live experiments were on students
 
04:17:17.510 --> 04:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
not on primates or another kind of
 
04:17:21.349 --> 04:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
primate um but uh that that aside um
 
04:17:24.269 --> 04:17:24.279 align:start position:0%
there are very very stringent guidelines
 
04:17:27.590 --> 04:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
um governing uh La laboratory research
 
04:17:30.630 --> 04:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh that um govern that thank you may I
 
04:17:33.590 --> 04:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
have a followup
 
04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
followup thank you um how many uh how
 
04:17:40.910 --> 04:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
many of these live markets exist do we
 
04:17:43.309 --> 04:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
know that they you know is this is this
 
04:17:45.030 --> 04:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
actually a problem
 
04:17:47.870 --> 04:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
here well thanks for the question um you
 
04:17:50.469 --> 04:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
know the reports that we've had again
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
maybe um Paul sander can can speak to
 
04:17:56.229 --> 04:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
this that there there are there are some
 
04:17:58.710 --> 04:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
stores that that sell that have live
 
04:18:01.070 --> 04:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
animals um there are some markets that
 
04:18:04.149 --> 04:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
this might be going on um there is a
 
04:18:08.149 --> 04:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
sense because of various populations uh
 
04:18:09.870 --> 04:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
increasing in New England and New
 
04:18:13.349 --> 04:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that um appreciate um being
 
04:18:16.830 --> 04:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
able to get live animals um that these
 
04:18:20.109 --> 04:18:20.119 align:start position:0%
may be growing um and that's fine I mean
 
04:18:22.269 --> 04:18:22.279 align:start position:0%
you know if if if appropriately
 
04:18:24.910 --> 04:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
regulated that's that's consumer Choice
 
04:18:26.469 --> 04:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
um but we just want to make sure that if
 
04:18:28.710 --> 04:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
they're there that we're making sure
 
04:18:32.030 --> 04:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
these um these taxons that might be
 
04:18:35.269 --> 04:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
zoonotic disease transmissible are it's
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
that it becomes very clear that no oh th
 
04:18:39.670 --> 04:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
those can't be those those can't be
 
04:18:44.510 --> 04:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
present so um you know again is you know
 
04:18:46.309 --> 04:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
the the markets the mark some markets
 
04:18:50.149 --> 04:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
are there but um let's be sure that we
 
04:18:52.670 --> 04:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
that we make sure we keep them safe
 
04:18:54.269 --> 04:18:54.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator is there anybody else
 
04:18:56.149 --> 04:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
in the fishing game room that wishes to
 
04:18:58.750 --> 04:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
ask a question of the senator we have uh
 
04:19:01.149 --> 04:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
Mr serson will be testifying next so if
 
04:19:02.309 --> 04:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
your question is more appropriate you
 
04:19:03.790 --> 04:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
might want to hold it for
 
04:19:08.309 --> 04:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
him so I see no further questions
 
04:19:15.590 --> 04:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:19.750 --> 04:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:19.760 --> 04:19:24.590 align:start position:0%
 
question

04:19:24.590 --> 04:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:27.990 --> 04:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
sand is there anyone from any questions
 
04:19:34.469 --> 04:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:37.550 --> 04:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
Comm questions
 
04:19:39.870 --> 04:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
no no
 
04:19:44.590 --> 04:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:48.990 --> 04:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
senator Paul Sanderson available yes
 
04:19:50.630 --> 04:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you I hope you can hear me at this
 
04:19:52.870 --> 04:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
point we can hear you we can hear you
 
04:19:56.349 --> 04:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh this is Paul Sanderson
 
04:19:57.750 --> 04:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
I'm the legal coordinator of the fish
 
04:20:00.149 --> 04:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
and game department uh in addition to
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
our written testimony I would like to
 
04:20:04.189 --> 04:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
thank Senator waters for his leadership
 
04:20:06.670 --> 04:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
on this particular issue and I will try
 
04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
to deal with a couple of points that
 
04:20:11.550 --> 04:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
have been raised in discussion so far um
 
04:20:14.429 --> 04:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
we are talking about a codification of
 
04:20:17.269 --> 04:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
proes that already somewhat exist
 
04:20:18.950 --> 04:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
cooperation between the fish and game
 
04:20:20.429 --> 04:20:20.439 align:start position:0%
department the Department of
 
04:20:22.429 --> 04:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services the Department of
 
04:20:24.030 --> 04:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and the
 
04:20:25.429 --> 04:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
04:20:27.670 --> 04:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
Agriculture uh the advantage of this is
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
it really codifies our process and uh
 
04:20:33.229 --> 04:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
gives us a clear road map of things to
 
04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
do in the event these issues are
 
04:20:38.830 --> 04:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
detected um when I when people have
 
04:20:40.710 --> 04:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
asked some questions about how these
 
04:20:43.429 --> 04:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
things actually work in practice we have
 
04:20:45.469 --> 04:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
haven't had a zootic question recently
 
04:20:47.630 --> 04:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
but we did have a recent issue of an
 
04:20:51.149 --> 04:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
invasive species uh where we had uh
 
04:20:54.750 --> 04:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
importation into the state um of zebra
 
04:20:57.870 --> 04:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
muscles that were involved in certain uh
 
04:21:00.750 --> 04:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
materials that were sold in pet stores
 
04:21:03.750 --> 04:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
and I wish to give you really the
 
04:21:05.870 --> 04:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
success story of cooperation between the
 
04:21:07.710 --> 04:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
various departments and how that was
 
04:21:09.790 --> 04:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
dealt with the information originally
 
04:21:11.550 --> 04:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
came from the US fish and wildlife
 
04:21:13.790 --> 04:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
Service uh communication occurred
 
04:21:16.269 --> 04:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
between all four departments uh pet
 
04:21:18.550 --> 04:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
stores are regulated by the Department
 
04:21:18.560 --> 04:21:19.670 align:start position:0%
stores are regulated by the Department
of

04:21:19.670 --> 04:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:21:21.990 --> 04:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
Agriculture uh and so what we were able
 
04:21:24.590 --> 04:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
to do was identify the offensive
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
material that contained the invasive
 
04:21:29.309 --> 04:21:29.319 align:start position:0%
Zebra muscles work with Private Industry
 
04:21:31.710 --> 04:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
to have them understand what these uh
 
04:21:35.469 --> 04:21:35.479 align:start position:0%
particular uh invasive species were uh
 
04:21:37.389 --> 04:21:37.399 align:start position:0%
bring them under control control and
 
04:21:39.189 --> 04:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
caused them to be destroyed in such a
 
04:21:41.590 --> 04:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
way that they were not going to be uh an
 
04:21:44.229 --> 04:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
issue for our state it was a model of
 
04:21:46.070 --> 04:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
cooperation between the
 
04:21:48.590 --> 04:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
Departments and so I what I want to do
 
04:21:51.790 --> 04:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
is just give you some comfort that in
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
fact these lines of communication exist
 
04:21:56.910 --> 04:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
uh when an issue presented itself that
 
04:21:59.269 --> 04:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
required some immediate action we were
 
04:22:00.990 --> 04:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
able to obtain the cooperation of
 
04:22:03.830 --> 04:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
Private Industry uh because they also
 
04:22:06.469 --> 04:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
did not want to see any sort of release
 
04:22:09.950 --> 04:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
of these invasive uh species and uh the
 
04:22:12.990 --> 04:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
system worked so uh we very much
 
04:22:14.950 --> 04:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate the efforts of the senator to
 
04:22:17.710 --> 04:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
bring this to everyone's attention uh it
 
04:22:19.309 --> 04:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
helps us to continue on with our
 
04:22:21.550 --> 04:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
existing communicative processes but the
 
04:22:24.910 --> 04:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
system does exist and it does work uh
 
04:22:26.550 --> 04:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
with that in mind I'd be happy to answer
 
04:22:28.030 --> 04:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions that you might have
 
04:22:28.040 --> 04:22:29.630 align:start position:0%
any other questions that you might have
for

04:22:29.630 --> 04:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:22:32.870 --> 04:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
me thank you thank you uh Paul um
 
04:22:34.630 --> 04:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
representative Spain has a question for
 
04:22:38.349 --> 04:22:38.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair thank you uh Paul
 
04:22:45.109 --> 04:22:45.119 align:start position:0%
um long time no here um I am looking at
 
04:22:48.389 --> 04:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
line 27 where it talks about the the
 
04:22:50.149 --> 04:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
chapter shall not prohibit seafood or
 
04:22:52.030 --> 04:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
shellfish markets or the sale or offer
 
04:22:54.389 --> 04:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
of sale of seafood or shellfish that are
 
04:22:55.830 --> 04:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
currently allowed under the Hampshire
 
04:22:57.710 --> 04:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
law and I'm just wondering because I
 
04:22:59.070 --> 04:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
don't know off the top of my head how
 
04:23:01.149 --> 04:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game classifies
 
04:23:08.149 --> 04:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
freshwater um fish species um and or
 
04:23:09.389 --> 04:23:09.399 align:start position:0%
things such as
 
04:23:12.790 --> 04:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
escargo and other species that may be
 
04:23:14.750 --> 04:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
consumed may be sold live for
 
04:23:17.109 --> 04:23:17.119 align:start position:0%
consumption but don't fall under uh
 
04:23:20.510 --> 04:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
something that was caught in um sea for
 
04:23:24.309 --> 04:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
seafood or um is not a
 
04:23:28.630 --> 04:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
shellfish okay um those are oftentimes
 
04:23:31.389 --> 04:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
with Inland species uh are materials
 
04:23:33.030 --> 04:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
that are used for bait for Inland
 
04:23:35.670 --> 04:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
fishing and we definitely regulate them
 
04:23:36.910 --> 04:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
as bait
 
04:23:39.469 --> 04:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
uh we regulate their importation their
 
04:23:42.229 --> 04:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
possession and their use and in fact we
 
04:23:44.710 --> 04:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
license bait dealers so once again if we
 
04:23:46.149 --> 04:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
determine that there are problems with
 
04:23:48.550 --> 04:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
them such as invasive species we're able
 
04:23:51.429 --> 04:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
to interact uh immediately and work on
 
04:23:53.950 --> 04:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
that we do have rules in our chapter FIS
 
04:23:57.189 --> 04:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
800 that allow our various divisions to
 
04:24:00.670 --> 04:24:00.680 align:start position:0%
engage in situations such as
 
04:24:04.750 --> 04:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
that follow up follow up um thank you Mr
 
04:24:08.550 --> 04:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
chair thank you again Paul um so if if
 
04:24:10.389 --> 04:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
what if the fish is not being sold for
 
04:24:12.469 --> 04:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
bait say what if a
 
04:24:14.950 --> 04:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
um fish is this happens to be a
 
04:24:19.710 --> 04:24:19.720 align:start position:0%
freshwater species of say catfish or um
 
04:24:19.720 --> 04:24:20.510 align:start position:0%
freshwater species of say catfish or um
a

04:24:20.510 --> 04:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:24:23.070 --> 04:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
freshwater uh crawfish that's going to
 
04:24:23.080 --> 04:24:24.510 align:start position:0%
freshwater uh crawfish that's going to
be

04:24:24.510 --> 04:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:24:26.990 --> 04:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
eaten uh again it's a matter of
 
04:24:29.189 --> 04:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
cooperation between departments if there
 
04:24:31.670 --> 04:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
becomes a public health question as to
 
04:24:33.590 --> 04:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
whether this would cause harm to humans
 
04:24:35.389 --> 04:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
in the matter of consumption we work
 
04:24:36.590 --> 04:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
with the Department of of Health and
 
04:24:38.950 --> 04:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
Human Services to maintain the safety of
 
04:24:38.960 --> 04:24:40.830 align:start position:0%

District
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
4 um this bill is a reintroduction of a
 
04:27:00.309 --> 04:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
bill from last year which passed the
 
04:27:03.630 --> 04:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
Senate unanimously and then got uh
 
04:27:06.590 --> 04:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
cized and um let me just explain a
 
04:27:09.389 --> 04:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
little bit of the background um here uh
 
04:27:11.189 --> 04:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
it tries to address the growing issue of
 
04:27:14.830 --> 04:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
der fishing gear traps trap Parts rope
 
04:27:18.870 --> 04:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
buoys foam microplastics and so on um
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
which all can be the source of of ocean
 
04:27:24.469 --> 04:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
Plastics and also create um
 
04:27:28.109 --> 04:27:28.119 align:start position:0%
navigational hazards uh there's um been
 
04:27:30.070 --> 04:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
increasing concern about this and we
 
04:27:32.389 --> 04:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
focused quite a bit on the issue uh on
 
04:27:34.790 --> 04:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
the commission on Marine natural
 
04:27:38.149 --> 04:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
resources uh an environment uh and we
 
04:27:41.189 --> 04:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
had several reports um you know from
 
04:27:43.189 --> 04:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
people concerned about ocean Plastics
 
04:27:46.910 --> 04:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
and then also uh folks in the fishing
 
04:27:49.030 --> 04:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
Community about the problems arising
 
04:27:53.229 --> 04:27:53.239 align:start position:0%
from der uh gear on the ocean bottom um
 
04:27:55.469 --> 04:27:55.479 align:start position:0%
so working with Eric Anderson who I may
 
04:27:56.790 --> 04:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
have submitted testimony or may be
 
04:27:59.109 --> 04:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
available to testify representing the
 
04:28:01.630 --> 04:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
fisherman has proposed in the in that
 
04:28:03.710 --> 04:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
commission that we try to come up with a
 
04:28:06.750 --> 04:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
way uh to help fund the clean clean up
 
04:28:11.109 --> 04:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
efforts uh on um on derel fishing
 
04:28:13.830 --> 04:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
fishing gear and you know just to to
 
04:28:15.469 --> 04:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
sketch in some of the issues that can be
 
04:28:18.389 --> 04:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
raised um the ocean Plastics uh show up
 
04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
in the marine environment but then they
 
04:28:23.550 --> 04:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
also show up in aquatic species um we're
 
04:28:26.229 --> 04:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
seeing them uh in fish we're seeing
 
04:28:28.550 --> 04:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
beginning to see them in shellfish and
 
04:28:30.389 --> 04:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
um there is evidence now that they are
 
04:28:32.630 --> 04:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
then showing up in human beings um who
 
04:28:35.790 --> 04:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
eat the fish and even in um in in uh in
 
04:28:38.550 --> 04:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
in utero in fetuses that uh these
 
04:28:40.870 --> 04:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
Plastics are showing up and they can do
 
04:28:42.990 --> 04:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things with the endocrine
 
04:28:45.750 --> 04:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
system and and um you know potentially
 
04:28:47.870 --> 04:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
past and other things as well so it's
 
04:28:50.510 --> 04:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
good to reduce them um the other thing
 
04:28:51.750 --> 04:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
is the na the
 
04:28:54.269 --> 04:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
navigational um Hazard you know we might
 
04:28:56.670 --> 04:28:56.680 align:start position:0%
have some discussion later about uh gear
 
04:28:58.950 --> 04:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
balls and what they are is that with the
 
04:29:02.349 --> 04:29:02.359 align:start position:0%
ocean action over time that the the gear
 
04:29:04.189 --> 04:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
traps and anything can form these really
 
04:29:06.710 --> 04:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
large balls and then not only might they
 
04:29:09.790 --> 04:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
be a a hindrance to navigation but also
 
04:29:11.630 --> 04:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
if you're trying to you know fish and
 
04:29:13.550 --> 04:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
troll or drag your nets uh you're going
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
to run into one of these things and and
 
04:29:18.590 --> 04:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
be in a big mess um so far what we've
 
04:29:21.189 --> 04:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
had is the coastal trap cleanup day a
 
04:29:23.950 --> 04:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
voluntary annual event and so far has
 
04:29:27.070 --> 04:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
gotten 156 tons of fishing gear off the
 
04:29:28.990 --> 04:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
coastline which is great for people you
 
04:29:31.389 --> 04:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
know recreating on the beaches but also
 
04:29:34.990 --> 04:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
um great for the environment uh as well
 
04:29:38.149 --> 04:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
now this event costs uh it's $1,300 to
 
04:29:42.030 --> 04:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
$2,500 for the heavy equipment um this
 
04:29:43.950 --> 04:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
has been largely funded by a grant
 
04:29:46.870 --> 04:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
program of late um we also have a
 
04:29:48.790 --> 04:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
fishing for energy program which puts
 
04:29:52.389 --> 04:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
out uh 30 yard rollof dumpster down at
 
04:29:54.790 --> 04:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
the Yankee Fisherman's Co-op so the
 
04:29:57.870 --> 04:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
fishing Community has a place to dump um
 
04:30:00.389 --> 04:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
its its gear and that's Sly important
 
04:30:01.990 --> 04:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
because municipalities don't want to
 
04:30:04.309 --> 04:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
take this for recycling anymore um but
 
04:30:06.229 --> 04:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
there is a company down in Mass usit who
 
04:30:09.389 --> 04:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
will Who will take it um and uh and and
 
04:30:13.149 --> 04:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
be able to recycle um that but that too
 
04:30:16.469 --> 04:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
costs and so with the potential loss of
 
04:30:18.790 --> 04:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
that grant funding that's on a time
 
04:30:21.070 --> 04:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
schedule it's going to run out um we
 
04:30:23.109 --> 04:30:23.119 align:start position:0%
thought that this might be a way to to
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
take care of that and it's you know
 
04:30:26.910 --> 04:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
something again worked very closely with
 
04:30:29.950 --> 04:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
the fishing game and um with the fishing
 
04:30:32.910 --> 04:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
community on it and so to turn to the to
 
04:30:35.149 --> 04:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
the bill itself it does a couple of
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
things it sets up a um derc fishing gear
 
04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
fund uh and uh then into that fund um
 
04:30:45.630 --> 04:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
lit control penalties for people who are
 
04:30:47.510 --> 04:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
dumping on the beach or there is a
 
04:30:49.710 --> 04:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
penalty if you if you um dump fishing
 
04:30:52.750 --> 04:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
gear um that that that those fines could
 
04:30:57.429 --> 04:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
go into the uh into the fund um and then
 
04:31:00.070 --> 04:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
for a certain set of licenses uh if
 
04:31:02.950 --> 04:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
you're a license holder then the fishing
 
04:31:06.149 --> 04:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
game director could set a sarch charge
 
04:31:08.269 --> 04:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
between 10 and
 
04:31:11.990 --> 04:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
$25 um and that would be deposited in
 
04:31:15.149 --> 04:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
the fund now I have provided the
 
04:31:17.269 --> 04:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
committee with an amendment um we had
 
04:31:19.070 --> 04:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
another meeting with Eric Anderson
 
04:31:21.870 --> 04:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday in fishing game um and he
 
04:31:24.229 --> 04:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
pointed out a couple of things number
 
04:31:26.750 --> 04:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
one is that the we have included here
 
04:31:29.389 --> 04:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
the shrimp license um but we've really
 
04:31:31.469 --> 04:31:31.479 align:start position:0%
lost Northern shrimp in the Gulf of
 
04:31:34.910 --> 04:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
Maine uh the last four years um the
 
04:31:38.670 --> 04:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
biomass seems to be moving north um and
 
04:31:40.910 --> 04:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
maybe diminishing some because of the
 
04:31:43.189 --> 04:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
warming uh of the Gulf of main you it's
 
04:31:44.790 --> 04:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
one of the fastest warming bodies in the
 
04:31:46.870 --> 04:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
world and that that biomass just moving
 
04:31:50.269 --> 04:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
to colder colder water so um and that
 
04:31:52.269 --> 04:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
fishery has been pretty much closed by
 
04:31:53.590 --> 04:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
the Atlantic states marine fisheries
 
04:31:55.670 --> 04:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
commission so it makes no sense at all
 
04:31:57.149 --> 04:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
here because nobody's doing the fishing
 
04:31:58.229 --> 04:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
to have that
 
04:32:00.469 --> 04:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
included the other thing was pointed out
 
04:32:03.790 --> 04:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
is that it also included the urchins and
 
04:32:07.149 --> 04:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
scalloping and there are very very few
 
04:32:10.389 --> 04:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh people who um are in that in that
 
04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
industry right now either so what the
 
04:32:16.030 --> 04:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
amendment does it takes out the shrimp
 
04:32:18.189 --> 04:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
and then it says I mean the heart of
 
04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
this bill is that okay you've got the
 
04:32:24.590 --> 04:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
sear charge but if you participate in a
 
04:32:28.630 --> 04:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
cleanup activity you don't pay you don't
 
04:32:31.910 --> 04:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
pay and what's great about this is that
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
and why the fishermen were interested in
 
04:32:35.510 --> 04:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
the bill was that it's going to
 
04:32:38.109 --> 04:32:38.119 align:start position:0%
encourage more
 
04:32:41.429 --> 04:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
participation and uh get the work done
 
04:32:43.269 --> 04:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
and hopefully have people be a little
 
04:32:45.910 --> 04:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
more responsible about their about their
 
04:32:50.229 --> 04:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
their gear um but if you do that you
 
04:32:52.830 --> 04:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
don't pay and so it'll be most of the
 
04:32:55.830 --> 04:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
out of state folks um who end up paying
 
04:32:58.229 --> 04:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
the sear charge uh because of our
 
04:32:59.950 --> 04:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
agreements with the states we can't just
 
04:33:01.229 --> 04:33:01.239 align:start position:0%
say we're going to charge a sear charge
 
04:33:04.269 --> 04:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
and out of Staters you know won't get
 
04:33:06.310 --> 04:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
very far with that but this is a way of
 
04:33:07.949 --> 04:33:07.959 align:start position:0%
doing it so that New Hampshire people if
 
04:33:10.789 --> 04:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
they don't want to pay they have to pay
 
04:33:12.510 --> 04:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
um you know one example Eric Anderson
 
04:33:14.590 --> 04:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
get well you know okay so there's maybe
 
04:33:17.949 --> 04:33:17.959 align:start position:0%
a person who's kind of a hobbyist gets a
 
04:33:20.070 --> 04:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
you know recreational license and has a
 
04:33:22.470 --> 04:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
few traps um but they're not going to be
 
04:33:23.869 --> 04:33:23.879 align:start position:0%
bothered to come to the cleanup well
 
04:33:26.070 --> 04:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
they okay they'll pay their 10 bucks um
 
04:33:27.869 --> 04:33:27.879 align:start position:0%
but for a lot of the people who are in
 
04:33:30.189 --> 04:33:30.199 align:start position:0%
who are actively fish fishing they
 
04:33:32.629 --> 04:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
already show up and um there'll be a
 
04:33:34.390 --> 04:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
variety of ways that the director is
 
04:33:36.390 --> 04:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
going to develop
 
04:33:37.869 --> 04:33:37.879 align:start position:0%
so that you know all kinds of
 
04:33:39.709 --> 04:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
participation so even if you can't make
 
04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
the cleanup day that's okay there be
 
04:33:43.629 --> 04:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
another way you can help participate in
 
04:33:45.429 --> 04:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
this and so you won't have to won't have
 
04:33:47.590 --> 04:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
to pay so then just to go down through
 
04:33:50.269 --> 04:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
the uh as you can just see in the um
 
04:33:53.590 --> 04:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
details of the of the bill then uh it
 
04:33:57.709 --> 04:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
simply repeats that um in various places
 
04:33:59.429 --> 04:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
the uh sech charge on the various
 
04:34:02.750 --> 04:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
licenses that I have uh I have
 
04:34:06.510 --> 04:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned um and then down
 
04:34:13.949 --> 04:34:13.959 align:start position:0%
towards the end um you get to the um the
 
04:34:15.910 --> 04:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
fishing gear Coastal cleanup and fishing
 
04:34:18.070 --> 04:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
for energy
 
04:34:22.709 --> 04:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
fund and uh here uh that fund is set up
 
04:34:25.670 --> 04:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to make particularly clear
 
04:34:26.629 --> 04:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:34:31.390 --> 04:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
industry that um this fund is going to
 
04:34:33.269 --> 04:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
go for this
 
04:34:35.470 --> 04:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
purpose and it's going to be trans
 
04:34:38.150 --> 04:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
parent there's reporting on
 
04:34:42.029 --> 04:34:42.039 align:start position:0%
it uh and so you know the fishermen are
 
04:34:43.390 --> 04:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
always keeping an eye on a dollar and
 
04:34:45.390 --> 04:34:45.400 align:start position:0%
they want to make sure that they're if
 
04:34:46.990 --> 04:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
they're they're paying it's not getting
 
04:34:49.990 --> 04:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
sucked into into other purposes so we
 
04:34:52.230 --> 04:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
did a lot to try to provide some
 
04:34:54.709 --> 04:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
reassurances around that and then the
 
04:34:56.789 --> 04:34:56.799 align:start position:0%
other question was raised by um that
 
04:34:59.029 --> 04:34:59.039 align:start position:0%
well what if you know the fund starts to
 
04:35:02.949 --> 04:35:02.959 align:start position:0%
build up and um you know there's plenty
 
04:35:05.709 --> 04:35:05.719 align:start position:0%
of money uh well the director fishing
 
04:35:09.670 --> 04:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
game has the um option here to decide
 
04:35:11.949 --> 04:35:11.959 align:start position:0%
not to collect it or to reduce reduce
 
04:35:13.551 --> 04:35:13.561 align:start position:0%
the amount so I think those are some
 
04:35:16.150 --> 04:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
kind of transparency and assurances on
 
04:35:19.510 --> 04:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
the creation of that of that fund um it
 
04:35:21.029 --> 04:35:21.039 align:start position:0%
would not only take the sear charges but
 
04:35:24.150 --> 04:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
if we do get some grants um the fines
 
04:35:25.830 --> 04:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
would come into this as well and so this
 
04:35:28.310 --> 04:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
would let us keep going and keep our
 
04:35:30.230 --> 04:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
keep our coasts clean and also help out
 
04:35:31.709 --> 04:35:31.719 align:start position:0%
the fishermen and get the gear off the
 
04:35:34.990 --> 04:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
bottom so um thank you uh members of the
 
04:35:37.189 --> 04:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
commit committees and and the chairs and
 
04:35:38.429 --> 04:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
got to take any
 
04:35:41.109 --> 04:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Senator I have a a
 
04:35:44.070 --> 04:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
question to start off with um so I'm
 
04:35:45.789 --> 04:35:45.799 align:start position:0%
looking at the last section of this bill
 
04:35:48.709 --> 04:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
the derel fishing gear Coastal cleanup
 
04:35:51.150 --> 04:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
and the last one kind of stumps me and
 
04:35:53.869 --> 04:35:53.879 align:start position:0%
fishing for energy fund and I'm trying
 
04:35:55.551 --> 04:35:55.561 align:start position:0%
to understand what fishing for energy
 
04:35:57.629 --> 04:35:57.639 align:start position:0%
fund has to do with this is I as I read
 
04:35:59.269 --> 04:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
the bill it talks about retrieving and
 
04:36:01.070 --> 04:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
disposing of derel gear and conducting
 
04:36:04.670 --> 04:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
dose tolea programs uh uh of and removal
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
of der like gear and Marine trash and
 
04:36:09.230 --> 04:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
then work in supporting the recycling
 
04:36:10.990 --> 04:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
for this fund but I I'm trying to
 
04:36:12.189 --> 04:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
understand what ises fishing for energy
 
04:36:15.230 --> 04:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
mean oh thanks for that question uh
 
04:36:17.230 --> 04:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
chairman and um I I should have I should
 
04:36:19.230 --> 04:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
have made it explicit earlier I I
 
04:36:22.269 --> 04:36:22.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned that Yankee Fisherman's Co-op
 
04:36:24.789 --> 04:36:24.799 align:start position:0%
dumpster um that that's a program that's
 
04:36:28.070 --> 04:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
the fishing for uh for energy program
 
04:36:29.990 --> 04:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
and um what they do is they take that
 
04:36:31.189 --> 04:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
dumpster when it's filled they take it
 
04:36:32.269 --> 04:36:32.279 align:start position:0%
down to their their plant in
 
04:36:34.709 --> 04:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and they they um they
 
04:36:38.269 --> 04:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
trans form those materials into um into
 
04:36:41.109 --> 04:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
fuels that can be used so great you know
 
04:36:43.189 --> 04:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's just it's a great recycling plant
 
04:36:44.830 --> 04:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
it costs us to have the dumpster and to
 
04:36:47.429 --> 04:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
transport it down there and uh but
 
04:36:49.349 --> 04:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's why that's there so
 
04:36:51.029 --> 04:36:51.039 align:start position:0%
that's it's it's referen to that
 
04:36:53.150 --> 04:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
existing program at the Yankee
 
04:36:55.429 --> 04:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
Fisherman's Co-op and and that's real
 
04:36:56.750 --> 04:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
popular too you know the fisherman
 
04:36:59.750 --> 04:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
having a place to to to dump their gear
 
04:37:02.109 --> 04:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
and doesn't cost them anything that's
 
04:37:05.230 --> 04:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
good repr blade as a question thank you
 
04:37:08.349 --> 04:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you Senator Waters
 
04:37:11.230 --> 04:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
um I have a question and a followup um
 
04:37:13.470 --> 04:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
but my first question has to do with
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
timing I love the idea but from a
 
04:37:25.269 --> 04:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:27.470 --> 04:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
somebody most people who purchase their
 
04:37:30.830 --> 04:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
license annually probably of the of time
 
04:37:33.269 --> 04:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
when the cleanup takes place so I
 
04:37:35.070 --> 04:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
imagine that they would have had to have
 
04:37:37.070 --> 04:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
proof of participating in the cleanup
 
04:37:39.750 --> 04:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
the prior year to get the waved fees on
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
the current Year's license or is that a
 
04:37:45.230 --> 04:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
rebate back to them after they've
 
04:37:47.510 --> 04:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
purchased their license and paid the fee
 
04:37:49.990 --> 04:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
and then participated in the cleanup how
 
04:37:51.230 --> 04:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
does that work because the timing
 
04:37:52.949 --> 04:37:52.959 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to really work out unless
 
04:37:55.709 --> 04:37:55.719 align:start position:0%
it's a fisherman that fishes every year
 
04:37:58.390 --> 04:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
and you start them out with um you know
 
04:38:00.230 --> 04:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
a gift of don't do it don't pay it the
 
04:38:00.240 --> 04:38:03.910 align:start position:0%
a gift of don't do it don't pay it the
first

04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:07.750 --> 04:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
year yeah uh you know we it's a great
 
04:38:09.510 --> 04:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you for it representative
 
04:38:11.070 --> 04:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
we tried to I I I think we tried to
 
04:38:12.310 --> 04:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
address it in the bill in terms of the
 
04:38:15.230 --> 04:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
ru making that the uh the director is
 
04:38:19.269 --> 04:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
going to have on it um because that
 
04:38:21.150 --> 04:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
that's the point we did not want to have
 
04:38:23.189 --> 04:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
people have to pay the first year you
 
04:38:26.109 --> 04:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
notice it goes into effect January 1st
 
04:38:28.429 --> 04:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
2022 and um some people buy their
 
04:38:31.269 --> 04:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
licenses right at the start some people
 
04:38:33.349 --> 04:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh buy them later on but the idea is
 
04:38:35.629 --> 04:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner would have excuse
 
04:38:37.029 --> 04:38:37.039 align:start position:0%
me the director would have ways to
 
04:38:37.039 --> 04:38:38.949 align:start position:0%
me the director would have ways to
recognize

04:38:38.949 --> 04:38:38.959 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
04:38:41.830 --> 04:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
participation um so that that doesn't
 
04:38:43.189 --> 04:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have to be paid the first
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
year that's the intent of the bill and
 
04:38:47.230 --> 04:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
uh maybe Paul Sanderson will have some
 
04:38:49.349 --> 04:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
further thoughts on that but um we we
 
04:38:50.629 --> 04:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
talked about that a lot and the intent
 
04:38:52.709 --> 04:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
of the bill is to say if you from the
 
04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
get-go you won't have to you won't have
 
04:38:54.480 --> 04:38:56.029 align:start position:0%
get-go you won't have to you won't have
to

04:38:56.029 --> 04:38:56.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:39:00.310 --> 04:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
pay follow up follow up um thank you and
 
04:39:01.949 --> 04:39:01.959 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Waters my followup is
 
04:39:05.429 --> 04:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
actually a question on that fund um you
 
04:39:07.470 --> 04:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it should the fund become
 
04:39:09.830 --> 04:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
well funded that the director has the
 
04:39:13.949 --> 04:39:13.959 align:start position:0%
options of not collecting the fee or um
 
04:39:16.629 --> 04:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
you know reducing the fee was there any
 
04:39:18.869 --> 04:39:18.879 align:start position:0%
thought given to redirecting allowing
 
04:39:20.189 --> 04:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
fishing game to have the ability to
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
redirect monies into fishery habitat
 
04:39:27.869 --> 04:39:27.879 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation and um prevention of of
 
04:39:30.910 --> 04:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
uh declination of species um because I
 
04:39:32.590 --> 04:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
believe the fishermen would probably be
 
04:39:36.750 --> 04:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
all in favor of that well thanks for
 
04:39:38.910 --> 04:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
your question and uh I will tell you I
 
04:39:40.670 --> 04:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
think you'll hear otherwise from the
 
04:39:43.590 --> 04:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
fishermen uh that they they really you
 
04:39:45.350 --> 04:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
know they really want to know if they're
 
04:39:47.350 --> 04:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
paying this for Dar gear that's what's
 
04:39:50.868 --> 04:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
going to now one answer I would have to
 
04:39:53.948 --> 04:39:53.958 align:start position:0%
the potential for the fund to grow
 
04:39:56.350 --> 04:39:56.360 align:start position:0%
larger is that there are a lot of things
 
04:39:58.430 --> 04:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
we could do and could pay for we're not
 
04:40:03.390 --> 04:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
doing now so you know the amount there
 
04:40:05.590 --> 04:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
that uh I mentioned you know $ 1,300
 
04:40:08.150 --> 04:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
$2500 for the heavy equipment and the
 
04:40:11.990 --> 04:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
dumpsters for the annual cleanup day yes
 
04:40:15.310 --> 04:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
but we the other big problem is those um
 
04:40:18.670 --> 04:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
those gear balls and right now you know
 
04:40:21.270 --> 04:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
if the Coast Guard and the fishing game
 
04:40:24.310 --> 04:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
divers and vessels are available and
 
04:40:27.150 --> 04:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
have some time and one's been
 
04:40:29.230 --> 04:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
identified they can go out and retrieve
 
04:40:32.390 --> 04:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
it but this fund would also provide some
 
04:40:35.110 --> 04:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
funding to get to do that work and that
 
04:40:37.830 --> 04:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
that costs you know um you're talking
 
04:40:39.788 --> 04:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
about divers and things but um that
 
04:40:41.470 --> 04:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's a big problem that now
 
04:40:43.470 --> 04:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
could be addressed that isn't being
 
04:40:46.868 --> 04:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
addressed so I I kind of think that the
 
04:40:49.590 --> 04:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
the the director will pick a a low
 
04:40:52.270 --> 04:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
amount like the $10 and that that'll do
 
04:40:54.150 --> 04:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
it that we that'll pretty well balance
 
04:40:57.270 --> 04:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
things out as uh as time goes
 
04:41:00.030 --> 04:41:00.040 align:start position:0%

is located CBR and thank you senator for
 
04:42:00.470 --> 04:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question the question is uh
 
04:42:02.230 --> 04:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that the grant or the
 
04:42:04.670 --> 04:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
funding is going to be over very soon
 
04:42:07.510 --> 04:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
how soon I like to see that that program
 
04:42:10.110 --> 04:42:10.120 align:start position:0%
that Yankee fisherman Coop does or all
 
04:42:13.750 --> 04:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
the fisherman does clean up a day once a
 
04:42:16.670 --> 04:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
year um I like to see that that going
 
04:42:19.470 --> 04:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
you know any possible way when that
 
04:42:21.510 --> 04:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
funding is going to be over and I have a
 
04:42:21.520 --> 04:42:22.628 align:start position:0%
funding is going to be over and I have a
followup

04:42:22.628 --> 04:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
followup
 
04:42:25.070 --> 04:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
too thanks for the question if I may
 
04:42:26.788 --> 04:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
take a moment I made a mistake just a
 
04:42:30.150 --> 04:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
moment ago um it's the non-resident
 
04:42:32.868 --> 04:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
commercial saltwater license and the
 
04:42:35.030 --> 04:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
resident commercial salt saltwater
 
04:42:37.750 --> 04:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
license so I'm sorry I gave the uh
 
04:42:40.510 --> 04:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
mistaken answer about the regular
 
04:42:42.788 --> 04:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
saltwater license it's the commercial
 
04:42:44.708 --> 04:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
ones that are here so I wanted to
 
04:42:47.590 --> 04:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
correct that um I'm I think Paul
 
04:42:50.150 --> 04:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
Sanderson have some more information I
 
04:42:52.270 --> 04:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
think the grant is running down in the
 
04:42:53.550 --> 04:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
next couple
 
04:42:57.110 --> 04:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
years um and that's that's that's why
 
04:42:58.830 --> 04:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
this is not a bad time to get this
 
04:43:01.868 --> 04:43:01.878 align:start position:0%
started so if we start it next year um
 
04:43:03.910 --> 04:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to transition out of that
 
04:43:06.190 --> 04:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
out of that anant and um keep the
 
04:43:08.110 --> 04:43:08.120 align:start position:0%
program going because as you said it's
 
04:43:09.270 --> 04:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
important down there at Yankee
 
04:43:10.868 --> 04:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
Fisherman's Co-op it
 
04:43:17.310 --> 04:43:17.320 align:start position:0%

Senator Waters um and then I think the
 
04:46:42.150 --> 04:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
reasons and the rational is to try and
 
04:46:45.510 --> 04:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
build um a fund that's going to continue
 
04:46:47.110 --> 04:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
this i' I've been involved with this
 
04:46:51.670 --> 04:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
clinic for 27 years and um and and I
 
04:46:53.990 --> 04:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's a worthy event that we
 
04:46:56.948 --> 04:46:56.958 align:start position:0%
don't want to um
 
04:47:02.070 --> 04:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh have um concluded because of um some
 
04:47:04.470 --> 04:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
monetary issues that have to be intended
 
04:47:08.270 --> 04:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
to and right now I think there's I I I
 
04:47:10.390 --> 04:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
think the scope of it extended out to
 
04:47:13.230 --> 04:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
860 licenses in the state of New
 
04:47:15.750 --> 04:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um that would be subject to
 
04:47:19.948 --> 04:47:19.958 align:start position:0%
this this fee approximately 60 to 80
 
04:47:23.350 --> 04:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
fishermen annually show up um and it and
 
04:47:25.868 --> 04:47:25.878 align:start position:0%
it bothers a lot of fishermen that that
 
04:47:29.190 --> 04:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
90% of the fishermen that show up they
 
04:47:31.788 --> 04:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
don't they none of their gear is
 
04:47:34.628 --> 04:47:34.638 align:start position:0%
involved in this in this cleanup
 
04:47:37.910 --> 04:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
and and um and it's just to try and
 
04:47:40.350 --> 04:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
identify to give credit to the fishermen
 
04:47:44.910 --> 04:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
that do show up and then to um um have
 
04:47:47.590 --> 04:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
fishermen that don't show up who who
 
04:47:50.190 --> 04:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
whose gear we collect have them make a
 
04:47:53.270 --> 04:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
contribution to the effort um monetarily
 
04:47:56.868 --> 04:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
so that we can keep it going and and um
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
we would like 860 lenses to show up uh
 
04:48:04.750 --> 04:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
we we do it annually we um
 
04:48:07.070 --> 04:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
um we collect a lot of material a lot of
 
04:48:09.910 --> 04:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
De a lot of gear that comes to Shore and
 
04:48:13.830 --> 04:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
and and and we do it responsibly um and
 
04:48:16.150 --> 04:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
I think so many components of this bill
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
is is going to um keep it going um from
 
04:48:25.230 --> 04:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
a fiscal perspective and um I I won't go
 
04:48:28.030 --> 04:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
on I I think I think Senator Waters is
 
04:48:30.548 --> 04:48:30.558 align:start position:0%
represented the bill and adjusted the
 
04:48:33.510 --> 04:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
bill correctly we feel confident with
 
04:48:36.350 --> 04:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
that it's in a dedicated fund that won't
 
04:48:40.350 --> 04:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
you know deviate from its purpose and
 
04:48:43.350 --> 04:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
um I take I you know I'd answer any
 
04:48:46.270 --> 04:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
questions if any of the um if if anybody
 
04:48:49.750 --> 04:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
has any um but we'd be in favor of this
 
04:48:52.670 --> 04:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
bill anybody from fishing game have
 
04:48:57.670 --> 04:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:59.868 --> 04:48:59.878 align:start position:0%

question um this sounds like an an
 
04:49:21.390 --> 04:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
excellent um opportunity to clean up and
 
04:49:24.788 --> 04:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
uh so listening to you and from the
 
04:49:27.990 --> 04:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
senator and from Mr Sanderson I would I
 
04:49:29.548 --> 04:49:29.558 align:start position:0%
just want to confirm with you that the
 
04:49:32.990 --> 04:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
fishermen are in support of this sech
 
04:49:33.000 --> 04:49:35.190 align:start position:0%
fishermen are in support of this sech
charge

04:49:35.190 --> 04:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
charge
 
04:49:37.948 --> 04:49:37.958 align:start position:0%
yes I mean we we feel that you know for
 
04:49:40.270 --> 04:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
the amount of people that that that do
 
04:49:43.190 --> 04:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
show up it's it's a concern every year
 
04:49:46.948 --> 04:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
for those that don't and and like I said
 
04:49:46.958 --> 04:49:48.230 align:start position:0%
for those that don't and and like I said
a

04:49:48.230 --> 04:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:49:52.868 --> 04:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
lot 90% 90% of the people that show up
 
04:49:57.390 --> 04:49:57.400 align:start position:0%
to clean up it's not their gear it's not
 
04:49:59.590 --> 04:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
they're cleaning up somebody else's gear
 
04:50:04.350 --> 04:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
that's come ashore and and um if if it
 
04:50:07.830 --> 04:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
it frustrates the people that do show up
 
04:50:10.990 --> 04:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
to say why aren't the people that have
 
04:50:13.430 --> 04:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
gear here why aren't they why why aren't
 
04:50:16.070 --> 04:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
they doing it it's I I don't want to get
 
04:50:18.230 --> 04:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
into some of the semantics of it but I
 
04:50:21.670 --> 04:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
in in in general I I the industry would
 
04:50:24.948 --> 04:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
support the fact that um you know this
 
04:50:27.990 --> 04:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
search charge is going to keep keep keep
 
04:50:30.270 --> 04:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
this program funded for the fiscal
 
04:50:33.270 --> 04:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
issues that it has to has to accomplish
 
04:50:35.350 --> 04:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
I think that's important if there if
 
04:50:37.830 --> 04:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
those fiscal issues aren't attended to
 
04:50:40.230 --> 04:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
then we don't know what would you know
 
04:50:43.150 --> 04:50:43.160 align:start position:0%
we don't know what would take
 
04:50:45.430 --> 04:50:45.440 align:start position:0%

Senator Waters as far as how Fisherman's
 
04:52:05.708 --> 04:52:05.718 align:start position:0%

that they participated when they may be
 
04:52:10.110 --> 04:52:10.120 align:start position:0%

uh we understand here that the intent of
 
04:52:26.270 --> 04:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature is perfectly clear and
 
04:52:27.990 --> 04:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
that we'll make provision in these
 
04:52:30.910 --> 04:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
initial rule sets to provide credit to
 
04:52:32.948 --> 04:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
people who have provided services to the
 
04:52:36.310 --> 04:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
program in the year prior uh to the uh
 
04:52:39.110 --> 04:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
rules being adopted so that we can make
 
04:52:41.270 --> 04:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
sure that people are not penalized for
 
04:52:43.030 --> 04:52:43.040 align:start position:0%

04:53:00.788 --> 04:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
shrimp and uh and
 
04:53:05.510 --> 04:53:05.520 align:start position:0%

holderness Grafton County District 8 and
 
06:00:12.788 --> 06:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
I am here as the prime sponsor of this
 
06:00:15.110 --> 06:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
amendment and hope that the committee
 
06:00:19.110 --> 06:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
will choose to amend uh add it on to uh
 
06:00:21.150 --> 06:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
house uh Senate Bill
 
06:00:24.070 --> 06:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
146 um just to give a little bit of a
 
06:00:27.270 --> 06:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
background uh Senate Bill 257 passed the
 
06:00:30.310 --> 06:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
leg legislature and became law in
 
06:00:33.430 --> 06:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
2019 and it prohibited the use of
 
06:00:36.788 --> 06:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
firefighting Foams which contain peror
 
06:00:38.830 --> 06:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
alcal chemicals or
 
06:00:43.910 --> 06:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
pasos and part of the bill was that Dees
 
06:00:46.230 --> 06:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
was required to Institute a takeback
 
06:00:49.468 --> 06:00:49.478 align:start position:0%
program of these phones for the purpose
 
06:00:53.110 --> 06:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
of safe and contained disposal now this
 
06:00:55.548 --> 06:00:55.558 align:start position:0%
of course passed in late
 
06:00:59.548 --> 06:00:59.558 align:start position:0%
2019 and uh the Bill the law states that
 
06:01:02.788 --> 06:01:02.798 align:start position:0%
they must begin the takeback program
 
06:01:05.070 --> 06:01:05.080 align:start position:0%
July 1st of
 
06:01:08.868 --> 06:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
2021 as we all know as uh Senator Waters
 
06:01:10.910 --> 06:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
called it co
 
06:01:14.110 --> 06:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
cized I think that's what he said anyway
 
06:01:16.628 --> 06:01:16.638 align:start position:0%
and um so things really slowed down in
 
06:01:19.070 --> 06:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
the beginning of 2020 and are just now
 
06:01:22.190 --> 06:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
getting back to normal both a Dees and
 
06:01:24.190 --> 06:01:24.200 align:start position:0%
at all the places that might have these
 
06:01:27.788 --> 06:01:27.798 align:start position:0%
Foams uh that they are storing so uh
 
06:01:29.788 --> 06:01:29.798 align:start position:0%
this amendment comes at the request of
 
06:01:32.708 --> 06:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
Dees and the only thing that it does is
 
06:01:35.670 --> 06:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
change it extends the date uh the time
 
06:01:38.708 --> 06:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
frame of the takeback program from July
 
06:01:42.670 --> 06:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
2021 until July 1
 
06:01:45.468 --> 06:01:45.478 align:start position:0%
2023 and I can try to answer questions
 
06:01:47.708 --> 06:01:47.718 align:start position:0%
but I am hoping that Mike whims from
 
06:01:51.110 --> 06:01:51.120 align:start position:0%

06:01:53.110 --> 06:01:53.120 align:start position:0%

was instrumental in getting this
amendment

06:01:56.350 --> 06:01:56.360 align:start position:0%

representative Smith for uh advancing
 
06:02:38.590 --> 06:02:38.600 align:start position:0%
this amendment so uh as uh
 
06:02:41.190 --> 06:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
representative Smith said we uh were
 
06:02:42.830 --> 06:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
poised actually to make some good
 
06:02:44.788 --> 06:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
progress on instituting a takeback
 
06:02:47.910 --> 06:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
program we actually had a uh
 
06:02:50.270 --> 06:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
supplemental environmental project that
 
06:02:52.190 --> 06:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
was associated with an enforcement
 
06:02:54.990 --> 06:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
action we had taken uh for a facility
 
06:02:57.990 --> 06:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
that was in a position to provide some
 
06:03:00.868 --> 06:03:00.878 align:start position:0%
assistance and some resources for
 
06:03:03.230 --> 06:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
collecting firefighting Foams from the
 
06:03:05.070 --> 06:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
various municipal fire departments in
 
06:03:07.990 --> 06:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
the state and as part of their uh
 
06:03:09.708 --> 06:03:09.718 align:start position:0%
agreement with us we're poised to
 
06:03:11.548 --> 06:03:11.558 align:start position:0%
actually take that material off their
 
06:03:13.070 --> 06:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
hands and send it to an appropriate
 
06:03:15.430 --> 06:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
disposal facility and we had actually
 
06:03:17.070 --> 06:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
identified the disposal facility that
 
06:03:19.868 --> 06:03:19.878 align:start position:0%
they would be using unfortunately before
 
06:03:22.270 --> 06:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
we could launch that um there started to
 
06:03:24.830 --> 06:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
be raised some question about that
 
06:03:27.350 --> 06:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
specific facility but also more
 
06:03:31.390 --> 06:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
generally about um the efficacy of and
 
06:03:35.670 --> 06:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
and the safety of um disposing of uh
 
06:03:37.430 --> 06:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
these firefighting forms through
 
06:03:39.468 --> 06:03:39.478 align:start position:0%
incineration um we based on the
 
06:03:40.788 --> 06:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
information we have available we
 
06:03:42.190 --> 06:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
continue to believe that thermal
 
06:03:45.270 --> 06:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
destruction incineration is the best uh
 
06:03:47.350 --> 06:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
technology available for safe and
 
06:03:50.590 --> 06:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
effective uh disposal of these materials
 
06:03:52.468 --> 06:03:52.478 align:start position:0%
but that is being questioned across the
 
06:03:54.868 --> 06:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
country right now EPA and the Department
 
06:03:57.430 --> 06:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
of Defense which as you can imagine is a
 
06:03:58.788 --> 06:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
dog in the fight here because they have
 
06:04:02.230 --> 06:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh you know air uh uh military
 
06:04:04.708 --> 06:04:04.718 align:start position:0%
bases where firefighting foam is has
 
06:04:07.150 --> 06:04:07.160 align:start position:0%
been used and also had where there are
 
06:04:09.030 --> 06:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
Legacy stocks of Foams that need
 
06:04:11.270 --> 06:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
disposal um so they're working really
 
06:04:14.468 --> 06:04:14.478 align:start position:0%
hard on uh evaluating the various uh
 
06:04:16.948 --> 06:04:16.958 align:start position:0%
incineration Technologies to make sure
 
06:04:19.590 --> 06:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
that they can be conducted safely but as
 
06:04:21.670 --> 06:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
a result of all those uncertainties in
 
06:04:23.310 --> 06:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
the industry and in the
 
06:04:26.510 --> 06:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
marketplace um we we we lost our ability
 
06:04:28.390 --> 06:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
and and we really weren't able to find
 
06:04:30.868 --> 06:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
any disposal facilities that we could
 
06:04:34.310 --> 06:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
use to to get rid of these materials so
 
06:04:36.510 --> 06:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
um we've asked for this amendment uh
 
06:04:38.070 --> 06:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
because we feel like we're going to need
 
06:04:40.788 --> 06:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
a couple of years here additional to get
 
06:04:42.628 --> 06:04:42.638 align:start position:0%
this reconciled we're hoping that with
 
06:04:44.390 --> 06:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment that will provide enough
 
06:04:47.830 --> 06:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
time for uh really on a national basis
 
06:04:51.350 --> 06:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh safe effective uh Technologies and
 
06:04:53.708 --> 06:04:53.718 align:start position:0%
Facilities who can actually do the work
 
06:04:55.990 --> 06:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
to be identified so that we could then
 
06:04:58.430 --> 06:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
put together a take back program and try
 
06:05:00.750 --> 06:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
to you know collect Foams from these
 
06:05:02.868 --> 06:05:02.878 align:start position:0%
various municipal fire departments and
 
06:05:05.110 --> 06:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
get them safely disposed of we just
 
06:05:07.750 --> 06:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
simply would be unable just practicably
 
06:05:09.910 --> 06:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
to get that done we we could go and
 
06:05:11.830 --> 06:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
collect it I suppose but then we'd know
 
06:05:14.590 --> 06:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
have nowhere to go with it so um so what
 
06:05:16.310 --> 06:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
we're looking for is to extend the
 
06:05:19.548 --> 06:05:19.558 align:start position:0%
period the deadline for this and uh get
 
06:05:21.150 --> 06:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
get ourselves in a position where we can
 
06:05:22.830 --> 06:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
safely collect and dispose of these
 
06:05:25.310 --> 06:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
materials on behalf of the the fire
 
06:05:27.750 --> 06:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
departments of uh of New Hampshire
 
06:05:31.070 --> 06:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:33.350 --> 06:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from members of
 
06:05:33.360 --> 06:05:34.990 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from members of
the

06:05:34.990 --> 06:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:05:35.000 --> 06:05:37.190 align:start position:0%
the
committee

06:05:37.190 --> 06:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:05:41.190 --> 06:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
questions uh seeing none thank you Miss
 
06:05:41.200 --> 06:05:43.788 align:start position:0%
questions uh seeing none thank you Miss
liat

06:05:43.788 --> 06:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
liat
 
06:05:48.830 --> 06:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh any uh any anyone else uh to speak
 
06:05:51.468 --> 06:05:51.478 align:start position:0%
on this bill on the on this
 
06:05:53.868 --> 06:05:53.878 align:start position:0%
amendment no other
 
06:05:58.190 --> 06:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
ansers seeing none uh
 
06:06:01.628 --> 06:06:01.638 align:start position:0%
I think that's uh that ends our session
 
06:06:05.948 --> 06:06:05.958 align:start position:0%
concerning uh what would be call part
 
06:06:09.628 --> 06:06:09.638 align:start position:0%
seven the of in other words
 
06:06:11.990 --> 06:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
this uh this
 
06:06:16.868 --> 06:06:16.878 align:start position:0%
amendment uh I think that's it for
 
06:06:19.948 --> 06:06:19.958 align:start position:0%
uh uh I'll spill
 
06:06:24.750 --> 06:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
one excuse me Senate Bill 146 is there
 
06:06:28.030 --> 06:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
any uh any other business uh that anyone
 
06:06:32.110 --> 06:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
on the uh committee would would wish to
 
06:06:36.548 --> 06:06:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:39.628 --> 06:06:39.638 align:start position:0%
point representative CR yeah Mr chairman
 
06:06:41.708 --> 06:06:41.718 align:start position:0%
just a a quick question on your thoughts
 
06:06:44.510 --> 06:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:49.190 --> 06:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
next uh we've got we've got much of a
 
06:06:51.270 --> 06:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
well we got much of most of May to be
 
06:06:53.390 --> 06:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
able to to do this we're need we're
 
06:06:57.628 --> 06:06:57.638 align:start position:0%
going to need something from uh
 
06:07:00.910 --> 06:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh obviously from fishing
 
06:07:05.670 --> 06:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
game uh and I think a lot of what
 
06:07:09.990 --> 06:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh whatever they give us will uh
 
06:07:11.548 --> 06:07:11.558 align:start position:0%
there'll be there'll be stuff that we
 
06:07:14.190 --> 06:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
will still have to do then we'll have to
 
06:07:17.468 --> 06:07:17.478 align:start position:0%
put together uh an
 
06:07:21.590 --> 06:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
amendment uh to because there are things
 
06:07:23.230 --> 06:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
that are going to have to happen there
 
06:07:25.070 --> 06:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
are there will there will be certain
 
06:07:27.270 --> 06:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
things that we will amend new you heard
 
06:07:29.868 --> 06:07:29.878 align:start position:0%
of some you heard some of it already
 
06:07:34.190 --> 06:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
today uh one thing I I don't know if I
 
06:07:37.350 --> 06:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
think many people know and I should have
 
06:07:39.350 --> 06:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
I think that was part of the discussion
 
06:07:47.750 --> 06:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh on item two uh the the uh item two
 
06:07:52.110 --> 06:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
the the text of item two is is is ALS is
 
06:07:56.230 --> 06:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
being being attached to Bill 43 House
 
06:08:01.270 --> 06:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
Bill four 13 in the Senate so
 
06:08:07.670 --> 06:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
that uh may be that may make 413 the the
 
06:08:12.548 --> 06:08:12.558 align:start position:0%
section two that we have move uh was
 
06:08:14.868 --> 06:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
we'll see what what happens is premature
 
06:08:19.468 --> 06:08:19.478 align:start position:0%
to even to to to be uh looking just a
 
06:08:22.830 --> 06:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
look ahead but is really is premature
 
06:08:27.868 --> 06:08:27.878 align:start position:0%
to predict anything uh but in
 
06:08:31.510 --> 06:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
in all probability it would it would
 
06:08:33.990 --> 06:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
probably happen the way that it would
 
06:08:37.830 --> 06:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
become a an amend an amendment to 413
 
06:08:39.590 --> 06:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
and and take it out
 
06:08:43.830 --> 06:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
of uh 146 simply
 
06:08:46.468 --> 06:08:46.478 align:start position:0%
because it then
 
06:08:49.708 --> 06:08:49.718 align:start position:0%
protects that portion of the of the bill
 
06:08:53.350 --> 06:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
for is not affected by well the other
 
06:08:57.910 --> 06:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
parts of 146 so and it gets it into the
 
06:09:03.430 --> 06:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
hands of the committee that uh that is
 
06:09:07.990 --> 06:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
is most qualified to adjudicate it so
 
06:09:11.548 --> 06:09:11.558 align:start position:0%
the any did that answer your question
 
06:09:14.750 --> 06:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
okay but look probably for within within
 
06:09:16.910 --> 06:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully within a couple of weeks to be
 
06:09:20.270 --> 06:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
able to to do to to to do to do
 
06:09:22.750 --> 06:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
something to try to get this
 
06:09:24.910 --> 06:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
together I'd rather not wait till the
 
06:09:24.920 --> 06:09:25.708 align:start position:0%
together I'd rather not wait till the
last

06:09:25.708 --> 06:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
last
 
06:09:28.468 --> 06:09:28.478 align:start position:0%
minute not that I know what the LA
 
06:09:31.468 --> 06:09:31.478 align:start position:0%
exactly what the last minute is but
 
06:09:33.830 --> 06:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
we'll find out
 
06:09:36.708 --> 06:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
um any other uh any other business or
 
06:09:37.788 --> 06:09:37.798 align:start position:0%
any other
 
06:09:40.990 --> 06:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
questions repres representative Smith
 
06:09:44.270 --> 06:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Rula or Mr chair um
 
06:09:47.270 --> 06:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts on retained
 
06:09:52.430 --> 06:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
bills uh we I'm told uh you can do your
 
06:09:54.190 --> 06:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
retained bills if you get rid of your
 
06:09:56.948 --> 06:09:56.958 align:start position:0%
what you have to what your workload is
 
06:09:59.548 --> 06:09:59.558 align:start position:0%
okay other words so the first first
 
06:10:01.948 --> 06:10:01.958 align:start position:0%
thing we have to do is get rid of this
 
06:10:04.510 --> 06:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh get rid of 146 then we can go on
 
06:10:10.350 --> 06:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
retain bills uh and but then we'll we'll
 
06:10:13.030 --> 06:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
talk but I've not really thought much
 
06:10:16.110 --> 06:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
about it beyond that because that's
 
06:10:18.230 --> 06:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's the edict is we can work on
 
06:10:20.948 --> 06:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
retain bills you can't vote on
 
06:10:24.708 --> 06:10:24.718 align:start position:0%
them but you can work on them uh but you
 
06:10:26.910 --> 06:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
got have to first get your get get your
 
06:10:30.868 --> 06:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
present work done sounds good okay
 
06:10:30.878 --> 06:10:32.430 align:start position:0%
present work done sounds good okay
anything

06:10:32.430 --> 06:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
anything
 
06:10:32.440 --> 06:10:34.030 align:start position:0%
anything
else

06:10:34.030 --> 06:10:34.040 align:start position:0%

post representative post for question um
 
06:10:43.510 --> 06:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
so but just to clarify we're not going
 
06:10:45.670 --> 06:10:45.680 align:start position:0%

did was mentioned um in our in our
 
06:11:09.590 --> 06:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
discussion on uh uh with the fish with
